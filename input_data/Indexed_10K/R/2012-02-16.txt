ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained in Item 8 of this report on Form 10 K. The following MD&A describes the principal factors affecting results of operations, financial resources, liquidity, contractual cash obligations, and critical accounting estimates. The information presented in the MD&A is for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 unless otherwise noted. OVERVIEW Ryder System, Inc. (Ryder) is a global leader in transportation and supply chain management solutions. Our business is divided into three business segments, which operate in highly competitive markets. Our customers select us based on numerous factors including service quality, price, technology, and service offerings. As an alternative to using our services, customers may choose to provide these services for themselves, or may choose to obtain similar or alternative services from other third party vendors. Our customer base includes enterprises operating in a variety of industries including automotive, food service, electronics, transportation, consumer packaged goods, grocery, lumber and wood products, and home furnishing. The Fleet Management Solutions (FMS) business segment is our largest segment providing full service leasing, contract maintenance, contract related maintenance, and commercial rental of trucks, tractors and trailers to customers principally in the U.S., Canada and the U.K. FMS revenue and assets in 2011 were $3.84 billion and $6.82 billion, respectively, representing 64% of our consolidated revenue and 89% of consolidated assets. The Supply Chain Solutions (SCS) business segment provides comprehensive supply chain consulting including distribution and transportation services throughout North America and Asia. SCS revenue in 2011 was $1.61 billion, representing 26% of our consolidated revenue. The Dedicated Contract Carriage (DCC) business segment provides vehicles and drivers as part of a dedicated transportation solution in the U.S. DCC revenue in 2011 was $601 million, representing 10% of our consolidated revenue. In 2011, we delivered significantly higher, double digit growth in both revenue and earnings despite volatile economic conditions. We achieved revenue growth of 18% and earnings growth of 44%. Our transactional products, including commercial rental and used vehicle sales, continued to perform exceptionally well, showing improvement not only in volumes, but commanding better pricing as well. In our contractual business, our largest product line, full service lease, began to show organic fleet growth in the latter part of the year, and we also saw significant organic improvement in SCS. Although DCC earnings showed an increase for the year, segment results were lower than our expectations. We generated very strong performance from the integration of five immediately accretive acquisitions completed since December of 2010. We achieved a positive spread between our return on capital and cost of capital, and our return on equity improved by 350 basis points to 11.9%. Total revenue was $6.05 billion, up 18% from $5.14 billion in 2010. Operating revenue (total revenue less FMS fuel and subcontracted transportation) was $4.81 billion in 2011, up 16%. Operating revenue increased primarily due to acquisitions and higher commercial rental revenue. Earnings before income taxes (EBT) from continuing operations increased 50% in 2011 to $279 million. The increase in EBT was primarily driven by improved commercial rental performance and used vehicle sales results. Acquisitions accounted for 22% of year over year EBT growth. However, these increases were partially offset by higher compensation costs as a result of improved company performance and higher maintenance costs on a relatively older lease fleet. EBT also included acquisition related restructuring and other costs of $6 million. Earnings from continuing operations increased 38% to $171 million in 2011 and earnings per diluted common share (EPS) from continuing operations increased 40% to $3.31 per diluted common share as the impact of improved EBT was partially offset by a higher income tax rate. EBT from continuing operations increased 30% in 2010 to $186 million. The increase in EBT from continuing operations was primarily driven by strong commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and higher SCS volumes. These improvements were partially offset by lower full service lease performance reflecting higher maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. EBT also included acquisition transaction costs of $4 million. Earnings from continuing operations increased 38% to $125 million in 2010 and EPS from continuing operations increased 46% to $2.37 per diluted common share. Earnings and EPS reflect improved EBT, a lower income tax rate and the benefit of share repurchases. 19 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) EBT, earnings and EPS from continuing operations included certain items we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operations and have been excluded from our comparable earnings measure. The following discussion provides a summary of the 2011 and 2010 special items which are discussed in more detail throughout our MD&A and within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: Continuing Operations Earnings BeforeIncome Taxes (EBT) Earnings Diluted Earningsper Share (EPS) (Dollars in thousands except per share amounts) 2011 Earnings / EPS from continuing operations $ 279,387 $ 171,368 $ 3.31 Restructuring and other charges 3,655 2,489 0.05 Acquisition transaction costs (1) 2,134 1,991 0.04 Charge related to tax law change in Michigan 5,350 0.10 Tax benefit from acquisition related transaction costs (568 ) (0.01 ) Comparable earnings from continuing operations (2) $ 285,176 $ 180,630 $ 3.49 2010 Earnings / EPS from continuing operations $ 186,305 $ 124,608 $ 2.37 Tax benefit associated with settlement of prior tax years audits and the expirationof a statute of limitation (10,771 ) (0.21 ) Gain on sale of an international asset previously impaired (1) (946 ) (946 ) (0.02 ) Acquisition transaction costs (1) 4,097 4,097 0.08 Comparable earnings from continuing operations (2) $ 189,456 $ 116,988 $ 2.22 (1) Refer to Note 26, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Non GAAP financial measure. We believe comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. Excluding the special items listed above, comparable earnings from continuing operations increased 54% to $181 million in 2011 and increased 24% to $117 million in 2010. Comparable EPS from continuing operations increased 57% to $3.49 in 2011 and 31% to $2.22 per diluted common share, respectively. Net earnings (earnings including discontinued operations) increased 44% in 2011 to $170 million or $3.28 per diluted common share and increased 91% in 2010 to $118 million or $2.25 per diluted common share. Net earnings in 2011 and 2010 were negatively impacted by losses from discontinued operations of $2 million and $6 million, respectively. EPS growth in 2011 exceeded the earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. Free cash flow from continuing operations was negative $257 million in 2011 compared to positive $258 million in 2010. The decline was driven by higher capital expenditures, primarily for revenue earning equipment. In addition, during 2011 we made $362 million in acquisition related payments. With our stronger earnings and positive operating cash flows, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares of common stock in 2011 for $59 million and made pension contributions of approximately $65 million. We also increased our annual dividend by 8% to $1.12 per share of common stock. Capital expenditures increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 and reflects higher full service lease spending for new business and replacement of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Our debt balance increased 23% to $3.38 billion at December 31, 2011 due to acquisitions and higher vehicle capital spending levels. Our debt to equity ratio also increased to 257% from 196% in 2010. Our total obligations (including off balance sheet debt) to equity ratio also increased to 261% from 203% in 2010. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2012 Outlook We are entering 2012 with good momentum, specific initiatives in place to accelerate organic growth, and confidence in our ability to deliver increased revenue and earnings even with only modest economic improvement anticipated in 2012. We intend to build on the significant progress made in 2011. We plan to deliver increased revenue and solid earnings leverage. In FMS, we expect organic growth of our full service lease fleet, with maintenance costs continuing at somewhat higher levels, resulting from a slightly older fleet. Our commercial rental product should continue to perform very well and we plan to grow that portion of our fleet, while also maintaining improved pricing. Our used vehicle sales activity is expected to generate higher volumes with stable pricing. During the first half of 2012, FMS earnings comparisons will also reflect the benefit of the Hill Hire acquisition completed in June of 2011. In SCS, which beginning in 2012 will be integrated to include all dedicated services, we expect performance to benefit from new business and higher volumes. We are forecasting pension expense to increase by $0.18 per share, based on lower actual and projected pension asset returns. At this early stage of the multi year vehicle replacement cycle, we plan to invest significant capital to refresh and grow both the lease and commercial rental fleets. These investments will benefit revenue and earnings in 2012 as well as in future years. Total revenue for the full year 2012 is forecast to be $6.3 billion, an increase of 4% compared with 2011. Operating revenue for the full year 2012 is forecast to increase 6% to $5.1 billion compared with 2011. In FMS, contractual leasing and maintenance revenue is expected to increase 5%. Commercial rental revenue is forecast to grow by 17%, driven by strong demand and higher pricing. Total SCS revenue is forecast to increase by 1% and SCS operating revenue is anticipated to increase by 2%, reflecting new sales activity and higher volumes. ACQUISITIONS We completed the following FMS acquisitions from 2009 to 2011, under which we acquired a companys fleet and contractual customers. The acquisitions operate under Ryders name and complement our existing market coverage and service network. The results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated results since the dates of acquisition. See Note 3, Acquisitions, for further discussion. Company Acquired Date Vehicles ContractualCustomers Market Hill Hire plc June 8, 2011 13,700 400 U.K. B.I.T. Leasing, Inc.

FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Revenue and cost of revenue by source Total revenue increased 18% in 2011 to $6.05 billion and increased 5% in 2010 to $5.14 billion. Operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation) increased 16% in 2011 to $4.81 billion and increased 2% in 2010 to $4.16 billion. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: 2011 2010 Total Operating Total Operating Acquisitions 9% 10% % % Organic including price and volume 3 5 1 1 FMS fuel 4 2 Subcontracted transportation 1 1 Foreign exchange 1 1 1 1 Total increase 18% 16% 5% 2% See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of the revenue impact from acquisitions and organic growth. Lease and Rental Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Lease and rental revenues $ 2,553,877 2,309,816 2,265,857 11% 2% Cost of lease and rental 1,746,057 1,604,253 1,552,954 9 3 Gross margin 807,820 705,563 712,903 14 (1) Gross margin % 32% 31% 31% Lease and rental revenues represent full service lease and commercial rental product offerings within our FMS business segment. Revenues increased 11% in 2011 to $2.55 billion and increased 2% in 2010 to $2.31 billion. In 2011, the increase was primarily driven by acquisitions and improved global rental demand and pricing. In 2010, the increase was driven by higher global rental market demand and rental pricing, partially offset by lower lease revenue as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Cost of lease and rental represents the direct costs related to lease and rental revenues. These costs are comprised of depreciation of revenue earning equipment, maintenance costs (primarily repair parts and labor), and other fixed costs such as licenses, insurance and operating taxes. Cost of lease and rental excludes interest costs from vehicle financing. Cost of lease and rental increased 9% in 2011 to $1.75 billion and increased 3% in 2010 to $1.60 billion. In 2011 and 2010, the cost increase was due to an increase in revenue and higher maintenance costs of 12% and 10%, respectively, on an older lease fleet. Gross margin increased 14% to $808 million in 2011 as a result of a 14% increase in rental pricing partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older lease fleet. Gross margin decreased 1% to $706 million in 2010. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained at 31% in 2010. Services Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Services revenue $ 2,609,174 2,109,748 1,995,515 24% 6% Cost of services 2,186,353 1,763,018 1,662,303 24 6 Gross margin 422,821 346,730 333,212 22 4 Gross margin % 16% 16% 17% Services revenue represents all the revenues associated with our SCS and DCC business segments as well as contract maintenance, contract related maintenance and fleet support services associated with our FMS business segment. Services revenue increased 24% in 2011 to $2.61 billion and increased 6% in 2010 to $2.11 billion. In 2011, the revenue increase was primarily driven by acquisitions in our SCS and DCC business segments. In 2010, the revenue increase was driven by higher freight volumes and fuel cost pass through in our SCS and DCC business segments. Cost of services represent the direct costs related to services revenue and is primarily comprised of salaries and employee related costs, SCS and DCC subcontracted transportation (purchased transportation from third parties) and maintenance costs. Cost of services increased 24% in 2011 to $2.19 billion and increased 6% in 2010 to $1.76 billion. In 2011 and 2010, the cost increase was due to an increase in revenue. Services gross margin increased 22% to $423 million in 2011 and increased 4% to $347 million in 2010. Services gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained at 16% in 2011 and 2010. Fuel Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Fuel services revenue $ 887,483 716,871 625,882 24% 15% Cost of fuel services 873,466 699,107 604,371 25 16 Gross margin 14,017 17,764 21,511 (21) (17) Gross margin % 2% 2% 3% Fuel services revenue increased 24% in 2011 to $887 million and increased 15% in 2010 to $717 million. In 2011 and 2010, the revenue increase was due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Cost of fuel services includes the direct costs associated with providing our customers with fuel. These costs include fuel, salaries and employee related costs of fuel island attendants and depreciation of our fueling facilities and equipment. Cost of fuel increased 25% in 2011 to $873 million and increased 16% in 2010 to $699 million. In 2011 and 2010, the cost increase was due to an increase in fuel prices. Subcontracted transportation costs, which are passed through to customers, increased $87 million and $62 million, respectively, in 2011 and 2010. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Fuel services gross margin decreased 21% to $14 million in 2011 and decreased 17% to $18 million in 2010. Fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in margin during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, fuel services margin is impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel is established based on market fuel costs. The decline in fuel margin in 2011 and 2010 is the result of less volatility in market fuel costs than in the prior year. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (In thousands) Other operating expenses $ 129,180 134,224 163,534 (4)% (18)% Other operating expenses includes costs related to our owned and leased facilities within the FMS business segment such as depreciation, rent, insurance, utilities and taxes. These facilities are utilized to provide maintenance to our lease, rental, contract maintenance and fleet support services customers. Other operating expenses also include the costs associated with used vehicle sales such as writedowns of used vehicles to fair market value and facilities costs. Other operating expenses as a percentage of lease and rental revenue decreased in 2011 and in 2010 due to lower writedowns on vehicles held for sale of $15 million in 2011 and $26 million in 2010. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) $ 771,244 655,375 625,524 18 % 5 % Percentage of total revenue 13% 13% 13% SG&A expenses increased 18% to $771 million in 2011 and increased 5% to $655 million in 2010. SG&A expenses as a percent of total revenue remained at 13% in 2011 and 2010. Incentive based compensation, which primarily impacts SG&A expenses, increased $37 million in 2011 compared to 2010. SG&A expenses were also impacted in 2011 by significant investments in information technology and sales initiatives. The increases in SG&A expenses were offset by the 2011 acquisitions for which we were able to leverage our overhead structure on the additional revenue contributed by the acquisitions. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (In thousands) Gains on vehicle sales, net $ (62,879) (28,727 ) (12,292 ) 119 % 134 % Gains on vehicle sales, net increased 119% to $63 million in 2011 due to a 30% increase in average pricing on vehicles sold. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased 134% to $29 million in 2010 due to a 41% increase in average pricing on vehicles sold. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $ 133,164 129,994 144,342 2 % (10 )% Effective interest rate 4.3% 5.2% 5.4% Interest expense increased 2% to $133 million in 2011 because of higher average outstanding debt partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. The increase in average outstanding debt reflects funding for acquisitions and increased capital spending. The lower effective interest rate reflects the replacement of higher interest rate debt with debt issuances at lower rates as well as an increased percentage of variable rate debt. Interest expense decreased 10% to $130 million in 2010 because of lower average debt balances and a lower effective interest rate. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $10 million. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Miscellaneous income, net $ (9,093 ) (7,114 ) (3,657 ) Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities held to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, gains and losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction gains, and non operating items. Miscellaneous income, net improved $2 million in 2011 due to gains from sales of facilities and insurance related recoveries, partially offset by lower income on our investment securities. Miscellaneous income, net improved $3 million in 2010 primarily due to higher gains from sales of property and a life insurance recovery, partially offset by lower income on investment securities. 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 3,655 6,406 Refer to Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these charges. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 108,019 61,697 53,652 75 % 15 % Effective tax rate from continuing operations 38.7% 33.1% 37.3% Our provision for income taxes and effective income tax rates are impacted by such items as enacted tax law changes, settlement of tax audits and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation. In the aggregate, these items increased the effective rate by 2.6% of pre tax earnings from continuing operations in 2011 and reduced the effective rate by 5.7% in 2010 and 6.5% in 2009. Excluding these items, our effective tax rate in 2011 benefitted by a higher proportionate amount of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and adjustments related to annual tax filings. The benefits in 2009 were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. On December 17, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act and on September 27, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Small Business Job Act of 2010 (collectively, the Acts). These Acts expanded and extended bonus depreciation to qualified property placed in service during 2010 through 2012. The impact of these changes resulted in a net operating loss carry forward in 2011. In addition, these changes will significantly reduce our U.S. federal tax payments through 2013. 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (1,591 ) (6,438 ) (28,172 ) Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of losses from discontinued operations. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

As part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Earnings Before Tax (EBT) from continuing operations, which includes an allocation of Central Support Services (CSS) and excludes restructuring and other charges, net and other items we do not believe are representative of the ongoing operations of the segment. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the EBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS.

Our FMS segment leases revenue earning equipment and provides fuel, maintenance and other ancillary services to our SCS and DCC segments. Inter segment revenue and EBT are accounted for at rates similar to those executed with third parties. EBT related to inter segment equipment and services billed to customers (equipment contribution) are included in both FMS and the business segment which served the customer and then eliminated (presented as Eliminations).

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Total revenue increased 14% in 2011 to $4.22 billion and increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) increased 10% in 2011 to $3.14 billion and increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: 2011 2010 Total Operating Total Operating Acquisitions 4% 5% % % Organic including price and volume 4 4 FMS fuel 5 3 Foreign exchange 1 1 1 1 Total increase 14% 10% 4% 1% 2011 versus 2010 Fuel services revenue increased 25% in 2011 due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Full service lease revenue increased 3% in 2011 reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions. We expect favorable full service lease comparisons to continue next year primarily due to acquisitions as well as new sales activity. Commercial rental revenue increased 38% in 2011 reflecting improved global market demand and higher pricing. We expect favorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics on our global fleet: Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 434,043 332,077 265,143 31% 25% Lease customer rental revenue (1) $ 288,514 193,006 165,915 49% 16% Average commercial rental power fleet size in service (2), (3) 28,500 23,800 23,000 20% 3% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 77.6% 76.1% 68.0% 150 bps 810 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS EBT increased 45% in 2011 to $250 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher compensation related expenses as well as higher maintenance costs on an older fleet. Commercial rental performance improved 66% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 23% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 10%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $49 million primarily due to higher pricing. The improvements in our commercial rental and used vehicle sales activities allowed us to better leverage our fixed costs. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 17%. 2010 versus 2009 Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010 from 68.0% in 2009. FMS EBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. The items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved by $42 million primarily due to higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2011, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2011, the number of NLE units increased because of higher used vehicle inventory levels and increased levels of vehicle replacement activity. For 2010, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. We expect NLE levels in 2012 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months endedDecember 31, 2011 Total Operating Acquisitions 10% 12% Organic including price and volume 3 4 FMS fuel 3 Subcontracted transportation 1 Total increase 17% 16% EBT increased 47% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $73 million. The increase in EBT was primarily driven by improved commercial rental performance and acquisitions. Acquisitions accounted for 24% of year over year EBT growth in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, these increases were partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs as a result of improved company performance. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results. EBT also included acquisition related restructuring and other charges of $3 million related to our Hill Hire integration efforts. Excluding these charges, comparable EBT increased 45% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $76 million. Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) from Continuing Operations Earnings from continuing operations increased 15% to $48 million and EPS from continuing operations increased 15% to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 included the $2.4 million or $0.05 per diluted common share acquisition related restructuring and other charges. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share benefit related to certain tax benefits partially offset by restructuring and other items. Excluding these items, comparable earnings and EPS from continuing operations increased 48% to $50 million and 49% to $0.97 per diluted common share, respectively. We believe that comparable EBT, comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable EPS from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. See Note (S), Other Items Impacting Comparability, for information regarding items excluded from the 2011 results. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Net Earnings and EPS Net earnings increased 30% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $48 million or $0.93 per diluted common share. Net earnings in the fourth quarter were impacted by earnings from discontinued operations of $0.4 million in 2011 and losses of $4 million in 2010. The earnings from discontinued operations in 2011 were due to $1 million of favorable insurance reserve developments.

Commercial rental revenue increased 38% in the fourth quarter of 2011 reflecting improved global market demand and higher pricing. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FMS EBT increased 41% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $70 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, acquisitions and improved used vehicle sales results. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older fleet, investments in sales and marketing initiatives, and higher compensation related expenses. Commercial rental performance improved 54% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 31% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 18%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $7 million primarily due to higher pricing and demand. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 23%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $409 million. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $325 million.

The TLC acquisition increased SCS EBT by 11% during the fourth quarter of 2011. SCS EBT also benefited from favorable prior year insurance development and new business. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 29% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $157 million. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 23% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $147 million.

Central Support Services Total CSS costs increased 8% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $52 million primarily due to higher compensation related expenses, investments in information technology initiatives and increased professional fees. Unallocated CSS costs increased 3% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $11 million primarily due to higher investments in information technology initiatives. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Financing activities 504,202 78,166 (542,016 ) Investing activities (1,657,172 ) (982,464 ) (448,610 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3,219 1,723 1,794 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (107,795 ) 125,459 (3,876 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.04 billion in 2011 compared with $1.03 billion in 2010 because of higher cash based earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital needs. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $504 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 due to higher borrowing needs to fund acquisitions and capital spending. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.66 billion in 2011 compared with $982 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2011. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Sales of revenue earning equipment 290,336 220,843 211,002 Sales of operating property and equipment 9,905 13,844 4,634 Collections on direct finance leases 62,224 61,767 65,242 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 37,395 Other, net 3,178 209 Total cash generated 1,441,816 1,327,666 1,266,043 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,698,589 ) (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) Free cash flow $ (256,773 ) 257,574 614,090 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Free cash flow decreased to negative $257 million in 2011 compared with positive $258 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2012 to be approximately $430 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line as well as the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 1,067,025 646,671 547,750 Commercial rental 622,181 378,678 7,436 1,689,206 1,025,349 555,186 Operating property and equipment 70,673 62,302 56,216 Total capital expenditures (1) 1,759,879 1,087,651 611,402 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (61,290 ) (17,559 ) 40,551 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,698,589 1,070,092 651,953 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions in 2011 of $37 million in assets held under capital leases resulting from a sale leaseback transaction. Non cash additions also exclude approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 because of higher full service lease vehicle spending for new business and replacements of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the rental fleet. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $2.15 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional debt financing. Working Capital 2011 2010 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,088,173 $ 1,023,301 Current liabilities 1,173,823 1,131,519 Working capital $ (85,650 ) $ (108,218 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(86) million at December 31, 2011 compared with $(108) million at December 31, 2010. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a net decrease of $146 million in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and cash. Excluding the decrease in short term debt, other working capital components decreased $123 million primarily due to a lower cash balance as of the end of 2011. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. Refer to Note 15, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our sale leaseback transactions. Guarantees. Refer to Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our agreements involving guarantees. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

The following discussion provides a summary of the 2011 and 2010 special items which are discussed in more detail throughout our MD&A and within the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements: Continuing Operations Earnings BeforeIncome Taxes (EBT) Earnings Diluted Earningsper Share (EPS) (Dollars in thousands except per share amounts) 2011 Earnings / EPS from continuing operations $ 279,387 $ 171,368 $ 3.31 Restructuring and other charges 3,655 2,489 0.05 Acquisition transaction costs (1) 2,134 1,991 0.04 Charge related to tax law change in Michigan 5,350 0.10 Tax benefit from acquisition related transaction costs (568 ) (0.01 ) Comparable earnings from continuing operations (2) $ 285,176 $ 180,630 $ 3.49 2010 Earnings / EPS from continuing operations $ 186,305 $ 124,608 $ 2.37 Tax benefit associated with settlement of prior tax years audits and the expirationof a statute of limitation (10,771 ) (0.21 ) Gain on sale of an international asset previously impaired (1) (946 ) (946 ) (0.02 ) Acquisition transaction costs (1) 4,097 4,097 0.08 Comparable earnings from continuing operations (2) $ 189,456 $ 116,988 $ 2.22 (1) Refer to Note 26, Other Items Impacting Comparability, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Non GAAP financial measure. We believe comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. Excluding the special items listed above, comparable earnings from continuing operations increased 54% to $181 million in 2011 and increased 24% to $117 million in 2010. Comparable EPS from continuing operations increased 57% to $3.49 in 2011 and 31% to $2.22 per diluted common share, respectively. Net earnings (earnings including discontinued operations) increased 44% in 2011 to $170 million or $3.28 per diluted common share and increased 91% in 2010 to $118 million or $2.25 per diluted common share. Net earnings in 2011 and 2010 were negatively impacted by losses from discontinued operations of $2 million and $6 million, respectively. EPS growth in 2011 exceeded the earnings growth reflecting the impact of share repurchase programs. Free cash flow from continuing operations was negative $257 million in 2011 compared to positive $258 million in 2010. The decline was driven by higher capital expenditures, primarily for revenue earning equipment. In addition, during 2011 we made $362 million in acquisition related payments. With our stronger earnings and positive operating cash flows, we repurchased approximately 1 million shares of common stock in 2011 for $59 million and made pension contributions of approximately $65 million. We also increased our annual dividend by 8% to $1.12 per share of common stock. Capital expenditures increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 and reflects higher full service lease spending for new business and replacement of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. Our debt balance increased 23% to $3.38 billion at December 31, 2011 due to acquisitions and higher vehicle capital spending levels. Our debt to equity ratio also increased to 257% from 196% in 2010. Our total obligations (including off balance sheet debt) to equity ratio also increased to 261% from 203% in 2010. 20 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2012 Outlook We are entering 2012 with good momentum, specific initiatives in place to accelerate organic growth, and confidence in our ability to deliver increased revenue and earnings even with only modest economic improvement anticipated in 2012. We intend to build on the significant progress made in 2011. We plan to deliver increased revenue and solid earnings leverage. In FMS, we expect organic growth of our full service lease fleet, with maintenance costs continuing at somewhat higher levels, resulting from a slightly older fleet. Our commercial rental product should continue to perform very well and we plan to grow that portion of our fleet, while also maintaining improved pricing. Our used vehicle sales activity is expected to generate higher volumes with stable pricing. During the first half of 2012, FMS earnings comparisons will also reflect the benefit of the Hill Hire acquisition completed in June of 2011. In SCS, which beginning in 2012 will be integrated to include all dedicated services, we expect performance to benefit from new business and higher volumes. We are forecasting pension expense to increase by $0.18 per share, based on lower actual and projected pension asset returns. At this early stage of the multi year vehicle replacement cycle, we plan to invest significant capital to refresh and grow both the lease and commercial rental fleets. These investments will benefit revenue and earnings in 2012 as well as in future years. Total revenue for the full year 2012 is forecast to be $6.3 billion, an increase of 4% compared with 2011. Operating revenue for the full year 2012 is forecast to increase 6% to $5.1 billion compared with 2011. In FMS, contractual leasing and maintenance revenue is expected to increase 5%. Commercial rental revenue is forecast to grow by 17%, driven by strong demand and higher pricing. Total SCS revenue is forecast to increase by 1% and SCS operating revenue is anticipated to increase by 2%, reflecting new sales activity and higher volumes. ACQUISITIONS We completed the following FMS acquisitions from 2009 to 2011, under which we acquired a companys fleet and contractual customers. The acquisitions operate under Ryders name and complement our existing market coverage and service network. The results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated results since the dates of acquisition. See Note 3, Acquisitions, for further discussion.

FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Revenue and cost of revenue by source Total revenue increased 18% in 2011 to $6.05 billion and increased 5% in 2010 to $5.14 billion. Operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation) increased 16% in 2011 to $4.81 billion and increased 2% in 2010 to $4.16 billion. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: 2011 2010 Total Operating Total Operating Acquisitions 9% 10% % % Organic including price and volume 3 5 1 1 FMS fuel 4 2 Subcontracted transportation 1 1 Foreign exchange 1 1 1 1 Total increase 18% 16% 5% 2% See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of the revenue impact from acquisitions and organic growth.

Revenues increased 11% in 2011 to $2.55 billion and increased 2% in 2010 to $2.31 billion. In 2011, the increase was primarily driven by acquisitions and improved global rental demand and pricing. In 2010, the increase was driven by higher global rental market demand and rental pricing, partially offset by lower lease revenue as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Cost of lease and rental represents the direct costs related to lease and rental revenues. These costs are comprised of depreciation of revenue earning equipment, maintenance costs (primarily repair parts and labor), and other fixed costs such as licenses, insurance and operating taxes. Cost of lease and rental excludes interest costs from vehicle financing. Cost of lease and rental increased 9% in 2011 to $1.75 billion and increased 3% in 2010 to $1.60 billion. In 2011 and 2010, the cost increase was due to an increase in revenue and higher maintenance costs of 12% and 10%, respectively, on an older lease fleet. Gross margin increased 14% to $808 million in 2011 as a result of a 14% increase in rental pricing partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older lease fleet. Gross margin decreased 1% to $706 million in 2010. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained at 31% in 2010. Services Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Services revenue $ 2,609,174 2,109,748 1,995,515 24% 6% Cost of services 2,186,353 1,763,018 1,662,303 24 6 Gross margin 422,821 346,730 333,212 22 4 Gross margin % 16% 16% 17% Services revenue represents all the revenues associated with our SCS and DCC business segments as well as contract maintenance, contract related maintenance and fleet support services associated with our FMS business segment. Services revenue increased 24% in 2011 to $2.61 billion and increased 6% in 2010 to $2.11 billion. In 2011, the revenue increase was primarily driven by acquisitions in our SCS and DCC business segments. In 2010, the revenue increase was driven by higher freight volumes and fuel cost pass through in our SCS and DCC business segments. Cost of services represent the direct costs related to services revenue and is primarily comprised of salaries and employee related costs, SCS and DCC subcontracted transportation (purchased transportation from third parties) and maintenance costs. Cost of services increased 24% in 2011 to $2.19 billion and increased 6% in 2010 to $1.76 billion. In 2011 and 2010, the cost increase was due to an increase in revenue. Services gross margin increased 22% to $423 million in 2011 and increased 4% to $347 million in 2010. Services gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained at 16% in 2011 and 2010. Fuel Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Fuel services revenue $ 887,483 716,871 625,882 24% 15% Cost of fuel services 873,466 699,107 604,371 25 16 Gross margin 14,017 17,764 21,511 (21) (17) Gross margin % 2% 2% 3% Fuel services revenue increased 24% in 2011 to $887 million and increased 15% in 2010 to $717 million. In 2011 and 2010, the revenue increase was due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Cost of fuel services includes the direct costs associated with providing our customers with fuel. These costs include fuel, salaries and employee related costs of fuel island attendants and depreciation of our fueling facilities and equipment. Cost of fuel increased 25% in 2011 to $873 million and increased 16% in 2010 to $699 million. In 2011 and 2010, the cost increase was due to an increase in fuel prices. Subcontracted transportation costs, which are passed through to customers, increased $87 million and $62 million, respectively, in 2011 and 2010. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Fuel services gross margin decreased 21% to $14 million in 2011 and decreased 17% to $18 million in 2010. Fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in margin during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, fuel services margin is impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel is established based on market fuel costs. The decline in fuel margin in 2011 and 2010 is the result of less volatility in market fuel costs than in the prior year. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (In thousands) Other operating expenses $ 129,180 134,224 163,534 (4)% (18)% Other operating expenses includes costs related to our owned and leased facilities within the FMS business segment such as depreciation, rent, insurance, utilities and taxes. These facilities are utilized to provide maintenance to our lease, rental, contract maintenance and fleet support services customers. Other operating expenses also include the costs associated with used vehicle sales such as writedowns of used vehicles to fair market value and facilities costs. Other operating expenses as a percentage of lease and rental revenue decreased in 2011 and in 2010 due to lower writedowns on vehicles held for sale of $15 million in 2011 and $26 million in 2010. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) $ 771,244 655,375 625,524 18 % 5 % Percentage of total revenue 13% 13% 13% SG&A expenses increased 18% to $771 million in 2011 and increased 5% to $655 million in 2010. SG&A expenses as a percent of total revenue remained at 13% in 2011 and 2010. Incentive based compensation, which primarily impacts SG&A expenses, increased $37 million in 2011 compared to 2010. SG&A expenses were also impacted in 2011 by significant investments in information technology and sales initiatives. The increases in SG&A expenses were offset by the 2011 acquisitions for which we were able to leverage our overhead structure on the additional revenue contributed by the acquisitions. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (In thousands) Gains on vehicle sales, net $ (62,879) (28,727 ) (12,292 ) 119 % 134 % Gains on vehicle sales, net increased 119% to $63 million in 2011 due to a 30% increase in average pricing on vehicles sold. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased 134% to $29 million in 2010 due to a 41% increase in average pricing on vehicles sold. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $ 133,164 129,994 144,342 2 % (10 )% Effective interest rate 4.3% 5.2% 5.4% Interest expense increased 2% to $133 million in 2011 because of higher average outstanding debt partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. The increase in average outstanding debt reflects funding for acquisitions and increased capital spending. The lower effective interest rate reflects the replacement of higher interest rate debt with debt issuances at lower rates as well as an increased percentage of variable rate debt. Interest expense decreased 10% to $130 million in 2010 because of lower average debt balances and a lower effective interest rate. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $10 million. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Miscellaneous income, net $ (9,093 ) (7,114 ) (3,657 ) Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities held to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, gains and losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction gains, and non operating items. Miscellaneous income, net improved $2 million in 2011 due to gains from sales of facilities and insurance related recoveries, partially offset by lower income on our investment securities. Miscellaneous income, net improved $3 million in 2010 primarily due to higher gains from sales of property and a life insurance recovery, partially offset by lower income on investment securities. 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 3,655 6,406 Refer to Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these charges. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 108,019 61,697 53,652 75 % 15 % Effective tax rate from continuing operations 38.7% 33.1% 37.3% Our provision for income taxes and effective income tax rates are impacted by such items as enacted tax law changes, settlement of tax audits and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation. In the aggregate, these items increased the effective rate by 2.6% of pre tax earnings from continuing operations in 2011 and reduced the effective rate by 5.7% in 2010 and 6.5% in 2009. Excluding these items, our effective tax rate in 2011 benefitted by a higher proportionate amount of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and adjustments related to annual tax filings. The benefits in 2009 were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. On December 17, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act and on September 27, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Small Business Job Act of 2010 (collectively, the Acts). These Acts expanded and extended bonus depreciation to qualified property placed in service during 2010 through 2012. The impact of these changes resulted in a net operating loss carry forward in 2011. In addition, these changes will significantly reduce our U.S. federal tax payments through 2013. 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (1,591 ) (6,438 ) (28,172 ) Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of losses from discontinued operations. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

As part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Earnings Before Tax (EBT) from continuing operations, which includes an allocation of Central Support Services (CSS) and excludes restructuring and other charges, net and other items we do not believe are representative of the ongoing operations of the segment. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the EBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs are allocated to the business segments. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Total revenue increased 14% in 2011 to $4.22 billion and increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) increased 10% in 2011 to $3.14 billion and increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion.

Full service lease revenue increased 3% in 2011 reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions. We expect favorable full service lease comparisons to continue next year primarily due to acquisitions as well as new sales activity. Commercial rental revenue increased 38% in 2011 reflecting improved global market demand and higher pricing. We expect favorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics on our global fleet: Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 434,043 332,077 265,143 31% 25% Lease customer rental revenue (1) $ 288,514 193,006 165,915 49% 16% Average commercial rental power fleet size in service (2), (3) 28,500 23,800 23,000 20% 3% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 77.6% 76.1% 68.0% 150 bps 810 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS EBT increased 45% in 2011 to $250 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher compensation related expenses as well as higher maintenance costs on an older fleet. Commercial rental performance improved 66% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 23% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 10%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $49 million primarily due to higher pricing. The improvements in our commercial rental and used vehicle sales activities allowed us to better leverage our fixed costs. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 17%. 2010 versus 2009 Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010 from 68.0% in 2009. FMS EBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. The items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved by $42 million primarily due to higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2011, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2011, the number of NLE units increased because of higher used vehicle inventory levels and increased levels of vehicle replacement activity. For 2010, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. We expect NLE levels in 2012 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months endedDecember 31, 2011 Total Operating Acquisitions 10% 12% Organic including price and volume 3 4 FMS fuel 3 Subcontracted transportation 1 Total increase 17% 16% EBT increased 47% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $73 million. The increase in EBT was primarily driven by improved commercial rental performance and acquisitions. Acquisitions accounted for 24% of year over year EBT growth in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, these increases were partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs as a result of improved company performance. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results. EBT also included acquisition related restructuring and other charges of $3 million related to our Hill Hire integration efforts. Excluding these charges, comparable EBT increased 45% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $76 million. Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) from Continuing Operations Earnings from continuing operations increased 15% to $48 million and EPS from continuing operations increased 15% to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 included the $2.4 million or $0.05 per diluted common share acquisition related restructuring and other charges. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share benefit related to certain tax benefits partially offset by restructuring and other items. Excluding these items, comparable earnings and EPS from continuing operations increased 48% to $50 million and 49% to $0.97 per diluted common share, respectively. We believe that comparable EBT, comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable EPS from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FMS EBT increased 41% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $70 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, acquisitions and improved used vehicle sales results. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older fleet, investments in sales and marketing initiatives, and higher compensation related expenses. Commercial rental performance improved 54% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 31% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 18%.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Financing activities 504,202 78,166 (542,016 ) Investing activities (1,657,172 ) (982,464 ) (448,610 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3,219 1,723 1,794 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (107,795 ) 125,459 (3,876 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.04 billion in 2011 compared with $1.03 billion in 2010 because of higher cash based earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital needs. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $504 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 due to higher borrowing needs to fund acquisitions and capital spending. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.66 billion in 2011 compared with $982 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2011. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Sales of revenue earning equipment 290,336 220,843 211,002 Sales of operating property and equipment 9,905 13,844 4,634 Collections on direct finance leases 62,224 61,767 65,242 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 37,395 Other, net 3,178 209 Total cash generated 1,441,816 1,327,666 1,266,043 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,698,589 ) (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) Free cash flow $ (256,773 ) 257,574 614,090 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Free cash flow decreased to negative $257 million in 2011 compared with positive $258 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2012 to be approximately $430 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line as well as the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 1,067,025 646,671 547,750 Commercial rental 622,181 378,678 7,436 1,689,206 1,025,349 555,186 Operating property and equipment 70,673 62,302 56,216 Total capital expenditures (1) 1,759,879 1,087,651 611,402 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (61,290 ) (17,559 ) 40,551 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,698,589 1,070,092 651,953 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions in 2011 of $37 million in assets held under capital leases resulting from a sale leaseback transaction. Non cash additions also exclude approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 because of higher full service lease vehicle spending for new business and replacements of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the rental fleet. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $2.15 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional debt financing. Working Capital 2011 2010 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,088,173 $ 1,023,301 Current liabilities 1,173,823 1,131,519 Working capital $ (85,650 ) $ (108,218 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(86) million at December 31, 2011 compared with $(108) million at December 31, 2010. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a net decrease of $146 million in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and cash. Excluding the decrease in short term debt, other working capital components decreased $123 million primarily due to a lower cash balance as of the end of 2011. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. Refer to Note 15, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our sale leaseback transactions. Guarantees. Refer to Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our agreements involving guarantees. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2012 Outlook We are entering 2012 with good momentum, specific initiatives in place to accelerate organic growth, and confidence in our ability to deliver increased revenue and earnings even with only modest economic improvement anticipated in 2012. We intend to build on the significant progress made in 2011. We plan to deliver increased revenue and solid earnings leverage. In FMS, we expect organic growth of our full service lease fleet, with maintenance costs continuing at somewhat higher levels, resulting from a slightly older fleet. Our commercial rental product should continue to perform very well and we plan to grow that portion of our fleet, while also maintaining improved pricing. Our used vehicle sales activity is expected to generate higher volumes with stable pricing. During the first half of 2012, FMS earnings comparisons will also reflect the benefit of the Hill Hire acquisition completed in June of 2011. In SCS, which beginning in 2012 will be integrated to include all dedicated services, we expect performance to benefit from new business and higher volumes. We are forecasting pension expense to increase by $0.18 per share, based on lower actual and projected pension asset returns. At this early stage of the multi year vehicle replacement cycle, we plan to invest significant capital to refresh and grow both the lease and commercial rental fleets. These investments will benefit revenue and earnings in 2012 as well as in future years. Total revenue for the full year 2012 is forecast to be $6.3 billion, an increase of 4% compared with 2011. Operating revenue for the full year 2012 is forecast to increase 6% to $5.1 billion compared with 2011. In FMS, contractual leasing and maintenance revenue is expected to increase 5%. Commercial rental revenue is forecast to grow by 17%, driven by strong demand and higher pricing. Total SCS revenue is forecast to increase by 1% and SCS operating revenue is anticipated to increase by 2%, reflecting new sales activity and higher volumes. ACQUISITIONS We completed the following FMS acquisitions from 2009 to 2011, under which we acquired a companys fleet and contractual customers. The acquisitions operate under Ryders name and complement our existing market coverage and service network. The results of these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated results since the dates of acquisition. See Note 3, Acquisitions, for further discussion.

FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Revenue and cost of revenue by source Total revenue increased 18% in 2011 to $6.05 billion and increased 5% in 2010 to $5.14 billion. Operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation) increased 16% in 2011 to $4.81 billion and increased 2% in 2010 to $4.16 billion.

Revenues increased 11% in 2011 to $2.55 billion and increased 2% in 2010 to $2.31 billion. In 2011, the increase was primarily driven by acquisitions and improved global rental demand and pricing. In 2010, the increase was driven by higher global rental market demand and rental pricing, partially offset by lower lease revenue as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Cost of lease and rental represents the direct costs related to lease and rental revenues. These costs are comprised of depreciation of revenue earning equipment, maintenance costs (primarily repair parts and labor), and other fixed costs such as licenses, insurance and operating taxes. Cost of lease and rental excludes interest costs from vehicle financing. Cost of lease and rental increased 9% in 2011 to $1.75 billion and increased 3% in 2010 to $1.60 billion. In 2011 and 2010, the cost increase was due to an increase in revenue and higher maintenance costs of 12% and 10%, respectively, on an older lease fleet. Gross margin increased 14% to $808 million in 2011 as a result of a 14% increase in rental pricing partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older lease fleet. Gross margin decreased 1% to $706 million in 2010. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained at 31% in 2010. Services Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Services revenue $ 2,609,174 2,109,748 1,995,515 24% 6% Cost of services 2,186,353 1,763,018 1,662,303 24 6 Gross margin 422,821 346,730 333,212 22 4 Gross margin % 16% 16% 17% Services revenue represents all the revenues associated with our SCS and DCC business segments as well as contract maintenance, contract related maintenance and fleet support services associated with our FMS business segment. Services revenue increased 24% in 2011 to $2.61 billion and increased 6% in 2010 to $2.11 billion. In 2011, the revenue increase was primarily driven by acquisitions in our SCS and DCC business segments. In 2010, the revenue increase was driven by higher freight volumes and fuel cost pass through in our SCS and DCC business segments. Cost of services represent the direct costs related to services revenue and is primarily comprised of salaries and employee related costs, SCS and DCC subcontracted transportation (purchased transportation from third parties) and maintenance costs. Cost of services increased 24% in 2011 to $2.19 billion and increased 6% in 2010 to $1.76 billion. In 2011 and 2010, the cost increase was due to an increase in revenue. Services gross margin increased 22% to $423 million in 2011 and increased 4% to $347 million in 2010. Services gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained at 16% in 2011 and 2010. Fuel Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Fuel services revenue $ 887,483 716,871 625,882 24% 15% Cost of fuel services 873,466 699,107 604,371 25 16 Gross margin 14,017 17,764 21,511 (21) (17) Gross margin % 2% 2% 3% Fuel services revenue increased 24% in 2011 to $887 million and increased 15% in 2010 to $717 million. In 2011 and 2010, the revenue increase was due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Cost of fuel services includes the direct costs associated with providing our customers with fuel. These costs include fuel, salaries and employee related costs of fuel island attendants and depreciation of our fueling facilities and equipment. Cost of fuel increased 25% in 2011 to $873 million and increased 16% in 2010 to $699 million. In 2011 and 2010, the cost increase was due to an increase in fuel prices. Subcontracted transportation costs, which are passed through to customers, increased $87 million and $62 million, respectively, in 2011 and 2010. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Fuel services gross margin decreased 21% to $14 million in 2011 and decreased 17% to $18 million in 2010. Fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in margin during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, fuel services margin is impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel is established based on market fuel costs. The decline in fuel margin in 2011 and 2010 is the result of less volatility in market fuel costs than in the prior year. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (In thousands) Other operating expenses $ 129,180 134,224 163,534 (4)% (18)% Other operating expenses includes costs related to our owned and leased facilities within the FMS business segment such as depreciation, rent, insurance, utilities and taxes. These facilities are utilized to provide maintenance to our lease, rental, contract maintenance and fleet support services customers. Other operating expenses also include the costs associated with used vehicle sales such as writedowns of used vehicles to fair market value and facilities costs. Other operating expenses as a percentage of lease and rental revenue decreased in 2011 and in 2010 due to lower writedowns on vehicles held for sale of $15 million in 2011 and $26 million in 2010.

SG&A expenses as a percent of total revenue remained at 13% in 2011 and 2010. Incentive based compensation, which primarily impacts SG&A expenses, increased $37 million in 2011 compared to 2010. SG&A expenses were also impacted in 2011 by significant investments in information technology and sales initiatives. The increases in SG&A expenses were offset by the 2011 acquisitions for which we were able to leverage our overhead structure on the additional revenue contributed by the acquisitions. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (In thousands) Gains on vehicle sales, net $ (62,879) (28,727 ) (12,292 ) 119 % 134 % Gains on vehicle sales, net increased 119% to $63 million in 2011 due to a 30% increase in average pricing on vehicles sold. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased 134% to $29 million in 2010 due to a 41% increase in average pricing on vehicles sold. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $ 133,164 129,994 144,342 2 % (10 )% Effective interest rate 4.3% 5.2% 5.4% Interest expense increased 2% to $133 million in 2011 because of higher average outstanding debt partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. The increase in average outstanding debt reflects funding for acquisitions and increased capital spending. The lower effective interest rate reflects the replacement of higher interest rate debt with debt issuances at lower rates as well as an increased percentage of variable rate debt. Interest expense decreased 10% to $130 million in 2010 because of lower average debt balances and a lower effective interest rate. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $10 million. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Miscellaneous income, net $ (9,093 ) (7,114 ) (3,657 ) Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities held to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, gains and losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction gains, and non operating items. Miscellaneous income, net improved $2 million in 2011 due to gains from sales of facilities and insurance related recoveries, partially offset by lower income on our investment securities. Miscellaneous income, net improved $3 million in 2010 primarily due to higher gains from sales of property and a life insurance recovery, partially offset by lower income on investment securities. 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 3,655 6,406 Refer to Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these charges.

In the aggregate, these items increased the effective rate by 2.6% of pre tax earnings from continuing operations in 2011 and reduced the effective rate by 5.7% in 2010 and 6.5% in 2009. Excluding these items, our effective tax rate in 2011 benefitted by a higher proportionate amount of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and adjustments related to annual tax filings. The benefits in 2009 were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. On December 17, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act and on September 27, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Small Business Job Act of 2010 (collectively, the Acts). These Acts expanded and extended bonus depreciation to qualified property placed in service during 2010 through 2012. The impact of these changes resulted in a net operating loss carry forward in 2011. In addition, these changes will significantly reduce our U.S. federal tax payments through 2013. 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (1,591 ) (6,438 ) (28,172 ) Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of losses from discontinued operations. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

As part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Earnings Before Tax (EBT) from continuing operations, which includes an allocation of Central Support Services (CSS) and excludes restructuring and other charges, net and other items we do not believe are representative of the ongoing operations of the segment. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the EBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs are allocated to the business segments. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS EBT increased 45% in 2011 to $250 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher compensation related expenses as well as higher maintenance costs on an older fleet. Commercial rental performance improved 66% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 23% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 10%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $49 million primarily due to higher pricing. The improvements in our commercial rental and used vehicle sales activities allowed us to better leverage our fixed costs. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 17%. 2010 versus 2009 Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010 from 68.0% in 2009. FMS EBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. The items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved by $42 million primarily due to higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2011, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2011, the number of NLE units increased because of higher used vehicle inventory levels and increased levels of vehicle replacement activity. For 2010, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. We expect NLE levels in 2012 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

The TLC acquisition increased SCS EBT by 27% during 2011. SCS EBT also benefited from higher freight volumes across all industries, new business, and favorable insurance development. These benefits were partially offset by increased compensation related expenses. 2010 versus 2009 SCS EBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts, and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs.

The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months endedDecember 31, 2011 Total Operating Acquisitions 10% 12% Organic including price and volume 3 4 FMS fuel 3 Subcontracted transportation 1 Total increase 17% 16% EBT increased 47% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $73 million. The increase in EBT was primarily driven by improved commercial rental performance and acquisitions. Acquisitions accounted for 24% of year over year EBT growth in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, these increases were partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs as a result of improved company performance. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results. EBT also included acquisition related restructuring and other charges of $3 million related to our Hill Hire integration efforts. Excluding these charges, comparable EBT increased 45% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $76 million. Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) from Continuing Operations Earnings from continuing operations increased 15% to $48 million and EPS from continuing operations increased 15% to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 included the $2.4 million or $0.05 per diluted common share acquisition related restructuring and other charges. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share benefit related to certain tax benefits partially offset by restructuring and other items. Excluding these items, comparable earnings and EPS from continuing operations increased 48% to $50 million and 49% to $0.97 per diluted common share, respectively. We believe that comparable EBT, comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable EPS from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. See Note (S), Other Items Impacting Comparability, for information regarding items excluded from the 2011 results. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Net Earnings and EPS Net earnings increased 30% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $48 million or $0.93 per diluted common share. Net earnings in the fourth quarter were impacted by earnings from discontinued operations of $0.4 million in 2011 and losses of $4 million in 2010. The earnings from discontinued operations in 2011 were due to $1 million of favorable insurance reserve developments.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FMS EBT increased 41% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $70 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, acquisitions and improved used vehicle sales results. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older fleet, investments in sales and marketing initiatives, and higher compensation related expenses. Commercial rental performance improved 54% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 31% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 18%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $7 million primarily due to higher pricing and demand. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 23%.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Financing activities 504,202 78,166 (542,016 ) Investing activities (1,657,172 ) (982,464 ) (448,610 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3,219 1,723 1,794 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (107,795 ) 125,459 (3,876 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.04 billion in 2011 compared with $1.03 billion in 2010 because of higher cash based earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital needs. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $504 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 due to higher borrowing needs to fund acquisitions and capital spending. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.66 billion in 2011 compared with $982 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2011. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Sales of revenue earning equipment 290,336 220,843 211,002 Sales of operating property and equipment 9,905 13,844 4,634 Collections on direct finance leases 62,224 61,767 65,242 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 37,395 Other, net 3,178 209 Total cash generated 1,441,816 1,327,666 1,266,043 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,698,589 ) (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) Free cash flow $ (256,773 ) 257,574 614,090 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Free cash flow decreased to negative $257 million in 2011 compared with positive $258 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2012 to be approximately $430 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line as well as the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 1,067,025 646,671 547,750 Commercial rental 622,181 378,678 7,436 1,689,206 1,025,349 555,186 Operating property and equipment 70,673 62,302 56,216 Total capital expenditures (1) 1,759,879 1,087,651 611,402 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (61,290 ) (17,559 ) 40,551 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,698,589 1,070,092 651,953 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions in 2011 of $37 million in assets held under capital leases resulting from a sale leaseback transaction. Non cash additions also exclude approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 because of higher full service lease vehicle spending for new business and replacements of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the rental fleet. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $2.15 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional debt financing. Working Capital 2011 2010 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,088,173 $ 1,023,301 Current liabilities 1,173,823 1,131,519 Working capital $ (85,650 ) $ (108,218 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(86) million at December 31, 2011 compared with $(108) million at December 31, 2010. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a net decrease of $146 million in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and cash. Excluding the decrease in short term debt, other working capital components decreased $123 million primarily due to a lower cash balance as of the end of 2011. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

FMS fuel services revenue net of related intersegment billings, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from the operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Subcontracted transportation revenue in our SCS and DCC business segments is excluded from the operating revenue computation as subcontracted transportation is largely a pass through to our customers and we realize minimal changes in profitability as a result of fluctuations in subcontracted transportation. Refer to the section titled Non GAAP Financial Measures for a reconciliation of total revenue to operating revenue. Revenue and cost of revenue by source Total revenue increased 18% in 2011 to $6.05 billion and increased 5% in 2010 to $5.14 billion. Operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation) increased 16% in 2011 to $4.81 billion and increased 2% in 2010 to $4.16 billion. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: 2011 2010 Total Operating Total Operating Acquisitions 9% 10% % % Organic including price and volume 3 5 1 1 FMS fuel 4 2 Subcontracted transportation 1 1 Foreign exchange 1 1 1 1 Total increase 18% 16% 5% 2% See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of the revenue impact from acquisitions and organic growth. Lease and Rental Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Lease and rental revenues $ 2,553,877 2,309,816 2,265,857 11% 2% Cost of lease and rental 1,746,057 1,604,253 1,552,954 9 3 Gross margin 807,820 705,563 712,903 14 (1) Gross margin % 32% 31% 31% Lease and rental revenues represent full service lease and commercial rental product offerings within our FMS business segment. Revenues increased 11% in 2011 to $2.55 billion and increased 2% in 2010 to $2.31 billion. In 2011, the increase was primarily driven by acquisitions and improved global rental demand and pricing. In 2010, the increase was driven by higher global rental market demand and rental pricing, partially offset by lower lease revenue as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. 22 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Cost of lease and rental represents the direct costs related to lease and rental revenues. These costs are comprised of depreciation of revenue earning equipment, maintenance costs (primarily repair parts and labor), and other fixed costs such as licenses, insurance and operating taxes. Cost of lease and rental excludes interest costs from vehicle financing. Cost of lease and rental increased 9% in 2011 to $1.75 billion and increased 3% in 2010 to $1.60 billion. In 2011 and 2010, the cost increase was due to an increase in revenue and higher maintenance costs of 12% and 10%, respectively, on an older lease fleet. Gross margin increased 14% to $808 million in 2011 as a result of a 14% increase in rental pricing partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older lease fleet. Gross margin decreased 1% to $706 million in 2010. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained at 31% in 2010. Services Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Services revenue $ 2,609,174 2,109,748 1,995,515 24% 6% Cost of services 2,186,353 1,763,018 1,662,303 24 6 Gross margin 422,821 346,730 333,212 22 4 Gross margin % 16% 16% 17% Services revenue represents all the revenues associated with our SCS and DCC business segments as well as contract maintenance, contract related maintenance and fleet support services associated with our FMS business segment. Services revenue increased 24% in 2011 to $2.61 billion and increased 6% in 2010 to $2.11 billion. In 2011, the revenue increase was primarily driven by acquisitions in our SCS and DCC business segments. In 2010, the revenue increase was driven by higher freight volumes and fuel cost pass through in our SCS and DCC business segments. Cost of services represent the direct costs related to services revenue and is primarily comprised of salaries and employee related costs, SCS and DCC subcontracted transportation (purchased transportation from third parties) and maintenance costs. Cost of services increased 24% in 2011 to $2.19 billion and increased 6% in 2010 to $1.76 billion. In 2011 and 2010, the cost increase was due to an increase in revenue. Services gross margin increased 22% to $423 million in 2011 and increased 4% to $347 million in 2010. Services gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained at 16% in 2011 and 2010. Fuel Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Fuel services revenue $ 887,483 716,871 625,882 24% 15% Cost of fuel services 873,466 699,107 604,371 25 16 Gross margin 14,017 17,764 21,511 (21) (17) Gross margin % 2% 2% 3% Fuel services revenue increased 24% in 2011 to $887 million and increased 15% in 2010 to $717 million. In 2011 and 2010, the revenue increase was due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Cost of fuel services includes the direct costs associated with providing our customers with fuel. These costs include fuel, salaries and employee related costs of fuel island attendants and depreciation of our fueling facilities and equipment. Cost of fuel increased 25% in 2011 to $873 million and increased 16% in 2010 to $699 million. In 2011 and 2010, the cost increase was due to an increase in fuel prices. Subcontracted transportation costs, which are passed through to customers, increased $87 million and $62 million, respectively, in 2011 and 2010. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Fuel services gross margin decreased 21% to $14 million in 2011 and decreased 17% to $18 million in 2010. Fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in margin during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, fuel services margin is impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel is established based on market fuel costs. The decline in fuel margin in 2011 and 2010 is the result of less volatility in market fuel costs than in the prior year. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (In thousands) Other operating expenses $ 129,180 134,224 163,534 (4)% (18)% Other operating expenses includes costs related to our owned and leased facilities within the FMS business segment such as depreciation, rent, insurance, utilities and taxes. These facilities are utilized to provide maintenance to our lease, rental, contract maintenance and fleet support services customers. Other operating expenses also include the costs associated with used vehicle sales such as writedowns of used vehicles to fair market value and facilities costs. Other operating expenses as a percentage of lease and rental revenue decreased in 2011 and in 2010 due to lower writedowns on vehicles held for sale of $15 million in 2011 and $26 million in 2010. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) $ 771,244 655,375 625,524 18 % 5 % Percentage of total revenue 13% 13% 13% SG&A expenses increased 18% to $771 million in 2011 and increased 5% to $655 million in 2010. SG&A expenses as a percent of total revenue remained at 13% in 2011 and 2010. Incentive based compensation, which primarily impacts SG&A expenses, increased $37 million in 2011 compared to 2010. SG&A expenses were also impacted in 2011 by significant investments in information technology and sales initiatives. The increases in SG&A expenses were offset by the 2011 acquisitions for which we were able to leverage our overhead structure on the additional revenue contributed by the acquisitions.

The increase in average outstanding debt reflects funding for acquisitions and increased capital spending. The lower effective interest rate reflects the replacement of higher interest rate debt with debt issuances at lower rates as well as an increased percentage of variable rate debt. Interest expense decreased 10% to $130 million in 2010 because of lower average debt balances and a lower effective interest rate. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $10 million. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Miscellaneous income, net improved $2 million in 2011 due to gains from sales of facilities and insurance related recoveries, partially offset by lower income on our investment securities. Miscellaneous income, net improved $3 million in 2010 primarily due to higher gains from sales of property and a life insurance recovery, partially offset by lower income on investment securities. 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 3,655 6,406 Refer to Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these charges.

In the aggregate, these items increased the effective rate by 2.6% of pre tax earnings from continuing operations in 2011 and reduced the effective rate by 5.7% in 2010 and 6.5% in 2009. Excluding these items, our effective tax rate in 2011 benefitted by a higher proportionate amount of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and adjustments related to annual tax filings. The benefits in 2009 were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. On December 17, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act and on September 27, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Small Business Job Act of 2010 (collectively, the Acts). These Acts expanded and extended bonus depreciation to qualified property placed in service during 2010 through 2012. The impact of these changes resulted in a net operating loss carry forward in 2011. In addition, these changes will significantly reduce our U.S. federal tax payments through 2013. 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (1,591 ) (6,438 ) (28,172 ) Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of losses from discontinued operations. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

As part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Earnings Before Tax (EBT) from continuing operations, which includes an allocation of Central Support Services (CSS) and excludes restructuring and other charges, net and other items we do not believe are representative of the ongoing operations of the segment. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the EBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs are allocated to the business segments. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Total revenue increased 14% in 2011 to $4.22 billion and increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) increased 10% in 2011 to $3.14 billion and increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion.

Full service lease revenue increased 3% in 2011 reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions. We expect favorable full service lease comparisons to continue next year primarily due to acquisitions as well as new sales activity. Commercial rental revenue increased 38% in 2011 reflecting improved global market demand and higher pricing. We expect favorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS EBT increased 45% in 2011 to $250 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher compensation related expenses as well as higher maintenance costs on an older fleet. Commercial rental performance improved 66% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 23% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 10%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $49 million primarily due to higher pricing. The improvements in our commercial rental and used vehicle sales activities allowed us to better leverage our fixed costs. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 17%. 2010 versus 2009 Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010 from 68.0% in 2009. FMS EBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. The items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved by $42 million primarily due to higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2011, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2011, the number of NLE units increased because of higher used vehicle inventory levels and increased levels of vehicle replacement activity. For 2010, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. We expect NLE levels in 2012 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

The TLC acquisition increased SCS EBT by 27% during 2011. SCS EBT also benefited from higher freight volumes across all industries, new business, and favorable insurance development. These benefits were partially offset by increased compensation related expenses. 2010 versus 2009 SCS EBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts, and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs.

Operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation) increased 16% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $1.24 billion. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months endedDecember 31, 2011 Total Operating Acquisitions 10% 12% Organic including price and volume 3 4 FMS fuel 3 Subcontracted transportation 1 Total increase 17% 16% EBT increased 47% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $73 million. The increase in EBT was primarily driven by improved commercial rental performance and acquisitions. Acquisitions accounted for 24% of year over year EBT growth in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, these increases were partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs as a result of improved company performance. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results. EBT also included acquisition related restructuring and other charges of $3 million related to our Hill Hire integration efforts. Excluding these charges, comparable EBT increased 45% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $76 million. Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) from Continuing Operations Earnings from continuing operations increased 15% to $48 million and EPS from continuing operations increased 15% to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 included the $2.4 million or $0.05 per diluted common share acquisition related restructuring and other charges. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share benefit related to certain tax benefits partially offset by restructuring and other items. Excluding these items, comparable earnings and EPS from continuing operations increased 48% to $50 million and 49% to $0.97 per diluted common share, respectively. We believe that comparable EBT, comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable EPS from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. See Note (S), Other Items Impacting Comparability, for information regarding items excluded from the 2011 results. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Net Earnings and EPS Net earnings increased 30% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $48 million or $0.93 per diluted common share. Net earnings in the fourth quarter were impacted by earnings from discontinued operations of $0.4 million in 2011 and losses of $4 million in 2010. The earnings from discontinued operations in 2011 were due to $1 million of favorable insurance reserve developments.

Commercial rental revenue increased 38% in the fourth quarter of 2011 reflecting improved global market demand and higher pricing. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FMS EBT increased 41% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $70 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, acquisitions and improved used vehicle sales results. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older fleet, investments in sales and marketing initiatives, and higher compensation related expenses. Commercial rental performance improved 54% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 31% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 18%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $7 million primarily due to higher pricing and demand. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 23%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $409 million. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $325 million.

Unallocated CSS costs increased 3% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $11 million primarily due to higher investments in information technology initiatives. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Financing activities 504,202 78,166 (542,016 ) Investing activities (1,657,172 ) (982,464 ) (448,610 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3,219 1,723 1,794 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (107,795 ) 125,459 (3,876 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.04 billion in 2011 compared with $1.03 billion in 2010 because of higher cash based earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital needs. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $504 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 due to higher borrowing needs to fund acquisitions and capital spending. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.66 billion in 2011 compared with $982 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2011. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Sales of revenue earning equipment 290,336 220,843 211,002 Sales of operating property and equipment 9,905 13,844 4,634 Collections on direct finance leases 62,224 61,767 65,242 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 37,395 Other, net 3,178 209 Total cash generated 1,441,816 1,327,666 1,266,043 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,698,589 ) (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) Free cash flow $ (256,773 ) 257,574 614,090 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Free cash flow decreased to negative $257 million in 2011 compared with positive $258 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2012 to be approximately $430 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line as well as the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 1,067,025 646,671 547,750 Commercial rental 622,181 378,678 7,436 1,689,206 1,025,349 555,186 Operating property and equipment 70,673 62,302 56,216 Total capital expenditures (1) 1,759,879 1,087,651 611,402 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (61,290 ) (17,559 ) 40,551 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,698,589 1,070,092 651,953 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions in 2011 of $37 million in assets held under capital leases resulting from a sale leaseback transaction. Non cash additions also exclude approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 because of higher full service lease vehicle spending for new business and replacements of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the rental fleet. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $2.15 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional debt financing. Working Capital 2011 2010 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,088,173 $ 1,023,301 Current liabilities 1,173,823 1,131,519 Working capital $ (85,650 ) $ (108,218 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(86) million at December 31, 2011 compared with $(108) million at December 31, 2010. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a net decrease of $146 million in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and cash. Excluding the decrease in short term debt, other working capital components decreased $123 million primarily due to a lower cash balance as of the end of 2011. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. Refer to Note 15, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our sale leaseback transactions.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Cost of lease and rental represents the direct costs related to lease and rental revenues. These costs are comprised of depreciation of revenue earning equipment, maintenance costs (primarily repair parts and labor), and other fixed costs such as licenses, insurance and operating taxes. Cost of lease and rental excludes interest costs from vehicle financing. Cost of lease and rental increased 9% in 2011 to $1.75 billion and increased 3% in 2010 to $1.60 billion. In 2011 and 2010, the cost increase was due to an increase in revenue and higher maintenance costs of 12% and 10%, respectively, on an older lease fleet. Gross margin increased 14% to $808 million in 2011 as a result of a 14% increase in rental pricing partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older lease fleet. Gross margin decreased 1% to $706 million in 2010. Gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained at 31% in 2010. Services Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Services revenue $ 2,609,174 2,109,748 1,995,515 24% 6% Cost of services 2,186,353 1,763,018 1,662,303 24 6 Gross margin 422,821 346,730 333,212 22 4 Gross margin % 16% 16% 17% Services revenue represents all the revenues associated with our SCS and DCC business segments as well as contract maintenance, contract related maintenance and fleet support services associated with our FMS business segment. Services revenue increased 24% in 2011 to $2.61 billion and increased 6% in 2010 to $2.11 billion. In 2011, the revenue increase was primarily driven by acquisitions in our SCS and DCC business segments. In 2010, the revenue increase was driven by higher freight volumes and fuel cost pass through in our SCS and DCC business segments. Cost of services represent the direct costs related to services revenue and is primarily comprised of salaries and employee related costs, SCS and DCC subcontracted transportation (purchased transportation from third parties) and maintenance costs. Cost of services increased 24% in 2011 to $2.19 billion and increased 6% in 2010 to $1.76 billion. In 2011 and 2010, the cost increase was due to an increase in revenue. Services gross margin increased 22% to $423 million in 2011 and increased 4% to $347 million in 2010. Services gross margin as a percentage of revenue remained at 16% in 2011 and 2010. Fuel Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Fuel services revenue $ 887,483 716,871 625,882 24% 15% Cost of fuel services 873,466 699,107 604,371 25 16 Gross margin 14,017 17,764 21,511 (21) (17) Gross margin % 2% 2% 3% Fuel services revenue increased 24% in 2011 to $887 million and increased 15% in 2010 to $717 million. In 2011 and 2010, the revenue increase was due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Cost of fuel services includes the direct costs associated with providing our customers with fuel. These costs include fuel, salaries and employee related costs of fuel island attendants and depreciation of our fueling facilities and equipment. Cost of fuel increased 25% in 2011 to $873 million and increased 16% in 2010 to $699 million. In 2011 and 2010, the cost increase was due to an increase in fuel prices. Subcontracted transportation costs, which are passed through to customers, increased $87 million and $62 million, respectively, in 2011 and 2010. 23 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Fuel services gross margin decreased 21% to $14 million in 2011 and decreased 17% to $18 million in 2010. Fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in margin during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, fuel services margin is impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel is established based on market fuel costs. The decline in fuel margin in 2011 and 2010 is the result of less volatility in market fuel costs than in the prior year. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (In thousands) Other operating expenses $ 129,180 134,224 163,534 (4)% (18)% Other operating expenses includes costs related to our owned and leased facilities within the FMS business segment such as depreciation, rent, insurance, utilities and taxes. These facilities are utilized to provide maintenance to our lease, rental, contract maintenance and fleet support services customers. Other operating expenses also include the costs associated with used vehicle sales such as writedowns of used vehicles to fair market value and facilities costs. Other operating expenses as a percentage of lease and rental revenue decreased in 2011 and in 2010 due to lower writedowns on vehicles held for sale of $15 million in 2011 and $26 million in 2010. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) $ 771,244 655,375 625,524 18 % 5 % Percentage of total revenue 13% 13% 13% SG&A expenses increased 18% to $771 million in 2011 and increased 5% to $655 million in 2010. SG&A expenses as a percent of total revenue remained at 13% in 2011 and 2010. Incentive based compensation, which primarily impacts SG&A expenses, increased $37 million in 2011 compared to 2010. SG&A expenses were also impacted in 2011 by significant investments in information technology and sales initiatives. The increases in SG&A expenses were offset by the 2011 acquisitions for which we were able to leverage our overhead structure on the additional revenue contributed by the acquisitions. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (In thousands) Gains on vehicle sales, net $ (62,879) (28,727 ) (12,292 ) 119 % 134 % Gains on vehicle sales, net increased 119% to $63 million in 2011 due to a 30% increase in average pricing on vehicles sold. Gains on vehicle sales, net increased 134% to $29 million in 2010 due to a 41% increase in average pricing on vehicles sold. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Interest expense $ 133,164 129,994 144,342 2 % (10 )% Effective interest rate 4.3% 5.2% 5.4% Interest expense increased 2% to $133 million in 2011 because of higher average outstanding debt partially offset by a lower effective interest rate. The increase in average outstanding debt reflects funding for acquisitions and increased capital spending. The lower effective interest rate reflects the replacement of higher interest rate debt with debt issuances at lower rates as well as an increased percentage of variable rate debt. Interest expense decreased 10% to $130 million in 2010 because of lower average debt balances and a lower effective interest rate. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $10 million. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Miscellaneous income, net $ (9,093 ) (7,114 ) (3,657 ) Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities held to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, gains and losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction gains, and non operating items. Miscellaneous income, net improved $2 million in 2011 due to gains from sales of facilities and insurance related recoveries, partially offset by lower income on our investment securities. Miscellaneous income, net improved $3 million in 2010 primarily due to higher gains from sales of property and a life insurance recovery, partially offset by lower income on investment securities. 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 3,655 6,406 Refer to Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these charges. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Provision for income taxes $ 108,019 61,697 53,652 75 % 15 % Effective tax rate from continuing operations 38.7% 33.1% 37.3% Our provision for income taxes and effective income tax rates are impacted by such items as enacted tax law changes, settlement of tax audits and the reversal of reserves for uncertain tax positions due to the expiration of statutes of limitation. In the aggregate, these items increased the effective rate by 2.6% of pre tax earnings from continuing operations in 2011 and reduced the effective rate by 5.7% in 2010 and 6.5% in 2009. Excluding these items, our effective tax rate in 2011 benefitted by a higher proportionate amount of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and adjustments related to annual tax filings. The benefits in 2009 were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. On December 17, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act and on September 27, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Small Business Job Act of 2010 (collectively, the Acts). These Acts expanded and extended bonus depreciation to qualified property placed in service during 2010 through 2012. The impact of these changes resulted in a net operating loss carry forward in 2011. In addition, these changes will significantly reduce our U.S. federal tax payments through 2013. 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (1,591 ) (6,438 ) (28,172 ) Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of losses from discontinued operations. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

As part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Earnings Before Tax (EBT) from continuing operations, which includes an allocation of Central Support Services (CSS) and excludes restructuring and other charges, net and other items we do not believe are representative of the ongoing operations of the segment. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the EBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs are allocated to the business segments. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Total revenue increased 14% in 2011 to $4.22 billion and increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) increased 10% in 2011 to $3.14 billion and increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion.

Full service lease revenue increased 3% in 2011 reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions. We expect favorable full service lease comparisons to continue next year primarily due to acquisitions as well as new sales activity. Commercial rental revenue increased 38% in 2011 reflecting improved global market demand and higher pricing. We expect favorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics on our global fleet: Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 434,043 332,077 265,143 31% 25% Lease customer rental revenue (1) $ 288,514 193,006 165,915 49% 16% Average commercial rental power fleet size in service (2), (3) 28,500 23,800 23,000 20% 3% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 77.6% 76.1% 68.0% 150 bps 810 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS EBT increased 45% in 2011 to $250 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher compensation related expenses as well as higher maintenance costs on an older fleet. Commercial rental performance improved 66% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 23% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 10%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $49 million primarily due to higher pricing. The improvements in our commercial rental and used vehicle sales activities allowed us to better leverage our fixed costs. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 17%. 2010 versus 2009 Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010 from 68.0% in 2009. FMS EBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. The items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved by $42 million primarily due to higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2011, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2011, the number of NLE units increased because of higher used vehicle inventory levels and increased levels of vehicle replacement activity. For 2010, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. We expect NLE levels in 2012 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months endedDecember 31, 2011 Total Operating Acquisitions 10% 12% Organic including price and volume 3 4 FMS fuel 3 Subcontracted transportation 1 Total increase 17% 16% EBT increased 47% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $73 million. The increase in EBT was primarily driven by improved commercial rental performance and acquisitions. Acquisitions accounted for 24% of year over year EBT growth in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, these increases were partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs as a result of improved company performance. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results. EBT also included acquisition related restructuring and other charges of $3 million related to our Hill Hire integration efforts. Excluding these charges, comparable EBT increased 45% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $76 million. Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) from Continuing Operations Earnings from continuing operations increased 15% to $48 million and EPS from continuing operations increased 15% to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 included the $2.4 million or $0.05 per diluted common share acquisition related restructuring and other charges. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share benefit related to certain tax benefits partially offset by restructuring and other items. Excluding these items, comparable earnings and EPS from continuing operations increased 48% to $50 million and 49% to $0.97 per diluted common share, respectively. We believe that comparable EBT, comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable EPS from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FMS EBT increased 41% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $70 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, acquisitions and improved used vehicle sales results. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older fleet, investments in sales and marketing initiatives, and higher compensation related expenses. Commercial rental performance improved 54% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 31% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 18%.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Financing activities 504,202 78,166 (542,016 ) Investing activities (1,657,172 ) (982,464 ) (448,610 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3,219 1,723 1,794 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (107,795 ) 125,459 (3,876 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.04 billion in 2011 compared with $1.03 billion in 2010 because of higher cash based earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital needs. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $504 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 due to higher borrowing needs to fund acquisitions and capital spending. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.66 billion in 2011 compared with $982 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2011. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Sales of revenue earning equipment 290,336 220,843 211,002 Sales of operating property and equipment 9,905 13,844 4,634 Collections on direct finance leases 62,224 61,767 65,242 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 37,395 Other, net 3,178 209 Total cash generated 1,441,816 1,327,666 1,266,043 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,698,589 ) (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) Free cash flow $ (256,773 ) 257,574 614,090 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Free cash flow decreased to negative $257 million in 2011 compared with positive $258 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2012 to be approximately $430 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line as well as the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 1,067,025 646,671 547,750 Commercial rental 622,181 378,678 7,436 1,689,206 1,025,349 555,186 Operating property and equipment 70,673 62,302 56,216 Total capital expenditures (1) 1,759,879 1,087,651 611,402 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (61,290 ) (17,559 ) 40,551 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,698,589 1,070,092 651,953 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions in 2011 of $37 million in assets held under capital leases resulting from a sale leaseback transaction. Non cash additions also exclude approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 because of higher full service lease vehicle spending for new business and replacements of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the rental fleet. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $2.15 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional debt financing. Working Capital 2011 2010 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,088,173 $ 1,023,301 Current liabilities 1,173,823 1,131,519 Working capital $ (85,650 ) $ (108,218 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(86) million at December 31, 2011 compared with $(108) million at December 31, 2010. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a net decrease of $146 million in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and cash. Excluding the decrease in short term debt, other working capital components decreased $123 million primarily due to a lower cash balance as of the end of 2011. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. Refer to Note 15, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our sale leaseback transactions. Guarantees. Refer to Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our agreements involving guarantees. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Fuel services gross margin decreased 21% to $14 million in 2011 and decreased 17% to $18 million in 2010. Fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in margin during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, fuel services margin is impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel is established based on market fuel costs. The decline in fuel margin in 2011 and 2010 is the result of less volatility in market fuel costs than in the prior year. Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (In thousands) Other operating expenses $ 129,180 134,224 163,534 (4)% (18)% Other operating expenses includes costs related to our owned and leased facilities within the FMS business segment such as depreciation, rent, insurance, utilities and taxes. These facilities are utilized to provide maintenance to our lease, rental, contract maintenance and fleet support services customers. Other operating expenses also include the costs associated with used vehicle sales such as writedowns of used vehicles to fair market value and facilities costs. Other operating expenses as a percentage of lease and rental revenue decreased in 2011 and in 2010 due to lower writedowns on vehicles held for sale of $15 million in 2011 and $26 million in 2010.

SG&A expenses were also impacted in 2011 by significant investments in information technology and sales initiatives. The increases in SG&A expenses were offset by the 2011 acquisitions for which we were able to leverage our overhead structure on the additional revenue contributed by the acquisitions.

The increase in average outstanding debt reflects funding for acquisitions and increased capital spending. The lower effective interest rate reflects the replacement of higher interest rate debt with debt issuances at lower rates as well as an increased percentage of variable rate debt. Interest expense decreased 10% to $130 million in 2010 because of lower average debt balances and a lower effective interest rate. A hypothetical 100 basis point change in short term market interest rates would change annual pre tax earnings by $10 million. 24 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Miscellaneous income, net improved $2 million in 2011 due to gains from sales of facilities and insurance related recoveries, partially offset by lower income on our investment securities. Miscellaneous income, net improved $3 million in 2010 primarily due to higher gains from sales of property and a life insurance recovery, partially offset by lower income on investment securities. 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 3,655 6,406 Refer to Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these charges.

In the aggregate, these items increased the effective rate by 2.6% of pre tax earnings from continuing operations in 2011 and reduced the effective rate by 5.7% in 2010 and 6.5% in 2009. Excluding these items, our effective tax rate in 2011 benefitted by a higher proportionate amount of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and adjustments related to annual tax filings. The benefits in 2009 were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. On December 17, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act and on September 27, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Small Business Job Act of 2010 (collectively, the Acts). These Acts expanded and extended bonus depreciation to qualified property placed in service during 2010 through 2012. The impact of these changes resulted in a net operating loss carry forward in 2011. In addition, these changes will significantly reduce our U.S. federal tax payments through 2013. 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (1,591 ) (6,438 ) (28,172 ) Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of losses from discontinued operations. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

As part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Earnings Before Tax (EBT) from continuing operations, which includes an allocation of Central Support Services (CSS) and excludes restructuring and other charges, net and other items we do not believe are representative of the ongoing operations of the segment. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the EBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs are allocated to the business segments. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Total revenue increased 14% in 2011 to $4.22 billion and increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) increased 10% in 2011 to $3.14 billion and increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion.

Full service lease revenue increased 3% in 2011 reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions. We expect favorable full service lease comparisons to continue next year primarily due to acquisitions as well as new sales activity. Commercial rental revenue increased 38% in 2011 reflecting improved global market demand and higher pricing. We expect favorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS EBT increased 45% in 2011 to $250 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher compensation related expenses as well as higher maintenance costs on an older fleet. Commercial rental performance improved 66% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 23% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 10%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $49 million primarily due to higher pricing. The improvements in our commercial rental and used vehicle sales activities allowed us to better leverage our fixed costs. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 17%. 2010 versus 2009 Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010 from 68.0% in 2009. FMS EBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. The items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved by $42 million primarily due to higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2011, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2011, the number of NLE units increased because of higher used vehicle inventory levels and increased levels of vehicle replacement activity. For 2010, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. We expect NLE levels in 2012 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

Operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation) increased 16% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $1.24 billion. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months endedDecember 31, 2011 Total Operating Acquisitions 10% 12% Organic including price and volume 3 4 FMS fuel 3 Subcontracted transportation 1 Total increase 17% 16% EBT increased 47% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $73 million. The increase in EBT was primarily driven by improved commercial rental performance and acquisitions. Acquisitions accounted for 24% of year over year EBT growth in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, these increases were partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs as a result of improved company performance. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results. EBT also included acquisition related restructuring and other charges of $3 million related to our Hill Hire integration efforts. Excluding these charges, comparable EBT increased 45% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $76 million. Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) from Continuing Operations Earnings from continuing operations increased 15% to $48 million and EPS from continuing operations increased 15% to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 included the $2.4 million or $0.05 per diluted common share acquisition related restructuring and other charges. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share benefit related to certain tax benefits partially offset by restructuring and other items. Excluding these items, comparable earnings and EPS from continuing operations increased 48% to $50 million and 49% to $0.97 per diluted common share, respectively. We believe that comparable EBT, comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable EPS from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. See Note (S), Other Items Impacting Comparability, for information regarding items excluded from the 2011 results. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Net Earnings and EPS Net earnings increased 30% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $48 million or $0.93 per diluted common share. Net earnings in the fourth quarter were impacted by earnings from discontinued operations of $0.4 million in 2011 and losses of $4 million in 2010. The earnings from discontinued operations in 2011 were due to $1 million of favorable insurance reserve developments.

Commercial rental revenue increased 38% in the fourth quarter of 2011 reflecting improved global market demand and higher pricing. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FMS EBT increased 41% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $70 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, acquisitions and improved used vehicle sales results. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older fleet, investments in sales and marketing initiatives, and higher compensation related expenses. Commercial rental performance improved 54% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 31% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 18%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $7 million primarily due to higher pricing and demand. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 23%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $409 million. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $325 million.

Unallocated CSS costs increased 3% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $11 million primarily due to higher investments in information technology initiatives. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Financing activities 504,202 78,166 (542,016 ) Investing activities (1,657,172 ) (982,464 ) (448,610 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3,219 1,723 1,794 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (107,795 ) 125,459 (3,876 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.04 billion in 2011 compared with $1.03 billion in 2010 because of higher cash based earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital needs. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $504 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 due to higher borrowing needs to fund acquisitions and capital spending. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.66 billion in 2011 compared with $982 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2011. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Sales of revenue earning equipment 290,336 220,843 211,002 Sales of operating property and equipment 9,905 13,844 4,634 Collections on direct finance leases 62,224 61,767 65,242 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 37,395 Other, net 3,178 209 Total cash generated 1,441,816 1,327,666 1,266,043 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,698,589 ) (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) Free cash flow $ (256,773 ) 257,574 614,090 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Free cash flow decreased to negative $257 million in 2011 compared with positive $258 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2012 to be approximately $430 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line as well as the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 1,067,025 646,671 547,750 Commercial rental 622,181 378,678 7,436 1,689,206 1,025,349 555,186 Operating property and equipment 70,673 62,302 56,216 Total capital expenditures (1) 1,759,879 1,087,651 611,402 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (61,290 ) (17,559 ) 40,551 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,698,589 1,070,092 651,953 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions in 2011 of $37 million in assets held under capital leases resulting from a sale leaseback transaction. Non cash additions also exclude approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 because of higher full service lease vehicle spending for new business and replacements of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the rental fleet. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $2.15 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional debt financing. Working Capital 2011 2010 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,088,173 $ 1,023,301 Current liabilities 1,173,823 1,131,519 Working capital $ (85,650 ) $ (108,218 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(86) million at December 31, 2011 compared with $(108) million at December 31, 2010. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a net decrease of $146 million in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and cash. Excluding the decrease in short term debt, other working capital components decreased $123 million primarily due to a lower cash balance as of the end of 2011. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. Refer to Note 15, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our sale leaseback transactions.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Miscellaneous income, net $ (9,093 ) (7,114 ) (3,657 ) Miscellaneous income, net consists of investment income on securities held to fund certain benefit plans, interest income, gains and losses from sales of property, foreign currency transaction gains, and non operating items. Miscellaneous income, net improved $2 million in 2011 due to gains from sales of facilities and insurance related recoveries, partially offset by lower income on our investment securities. Miscellaneous income, net improved $3 million in 2010 primarily due to higher gains from sales of property and a life insurance recovery, partially offset by lower income on investment securities. 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Restructuring and other charges, net $ 3,655 6,406 Refer to Note 5, Restructuring and Other Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these charges.

In the aggregate, these items increased the effective rate by 2.6% of pre tax earnings from continuing operations in 2011 and reduced the effective rate by 5.7% in 2010 and 6.5% in 2009. Excluding these items, our effective tax rate in 2011 benefitted by a higher proportionate amount of earnings in lower tax rate jurisdictions and adjustments related to annual tax filings. The benefits in 2009 were partially offset by the impact of non deductible expenses on lower pre tax earnings from continuing operations. On December 17, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization and Job Creation Act and on September 27, 2010, the U.S. enacted the Small Business Job Act of 2010 (collectively, the Acts). These Acts expanded and extended bonus depreciation to qualified property placed in service during 2010 through 2012. The impact of these changes resulted in a net operating loss carry forward in 2011. In addition, these changes will significantly reduce our U.S. federal tax payments through 2013. 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax $ (1,591 ) (6,438 ) (28,172 ) Refer to Note 4, Discontinued Operations, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of losses from discontinued operations. 25 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

As part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Earnings Before Tax (EBT) from continuing operations, which includes an allocation of Central Support Services (CSS) and excludes restructuring and other charges, net and other items we do not believe are representative of the ongoing operations of the segment. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the EBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs are allocated to the business segments. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Total revenue increased 14% in 2011 to $4.22 billion and increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) increased 10% in 2011 to $3.14 billion and increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: 2011 2010 Total Operating Total Operating Acquisitions 4% 5% % % Organic including price and volume 4 4 FMS fuel 5 3 Foreign exchange 1 1 1 1 Total increase 14% 10% 4% 1% 2011 versus 2010 Fuel services revenue increased 25% in 2011 due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Full service lease revenue increased 3% in 2011 reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions. We expect favorable full service lease comparisons to continue next year primarily due to acquisitions as well as new sales activity. Commercial rental revenue increased 38% in 2011 reflecting improved global market demand and higher pricing. We expect favorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS EBT increased 45% in 2011 to $250 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher compensation related expenses as well as higher maintenance costs on an older fleet. Commercial rental performance improved 66% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 23% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 10%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $49 million primarily due to higher pricing. The improvements in our commercial rental and used vehicle sales activities allowed us to better leverage our fixed costs. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 17%. 2010 versus 2009 Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010 from 68.0% in 2009. FMS EBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. The items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved by $42 million primarily due to higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2011, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2011, the number of NLE units increased because of higher used vehicle inventory levels and increased levels of vehicle replacement activity. For 2010, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. We expect NLE levels in 2012 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

The TLC acquisition increased SCS EBT by 27% during 2011. SCS EBT also benefited from higher freight volumes across all industries, new business, and favorable insurance development. These benefits were partially offset by increased compensation related expenses. 2010 versus 2009 SCS EBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts, and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs.

The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months endedDecember 31, 2011 Total Operating Acquisitions 10% 12% Organic including price and volume 3 4 FMS fuel 3 Subcontracted transportation 1 Total increase 17% 16% EBT increased 47% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $73 million. The increase in EBT was primarily driven by improved commercial rental performance and acquisitions. Acquisitions accounted for 24% of year over year EBT growth in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, these increases were partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs as a result of improved company performance. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results. EBT also included acquisition related restructuring and other charges of $3 million related to our Hill Hire integration efforts. Excluding these charges, comparable EBT increased 45% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $76 million. Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) from Continuing Operations Earnings from continuing operations increased 15% to $48 million and EPS from continuing operations increased 15% to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 included the $2.4 million or $0.05 per diluted common share acquisition related restructuring and other charges. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share benefit related to certain tax benefits partially offset by restructuring and other items. Excluding these items, comparable earnings and EPS from continuing operations increased 48% to $50 million and 49% to $0.97 per diluted common share, respectively. We believe that comparable EBT, comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable EPS from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. See Note (S), Other Items Impacting Comparability, for information regarding items excluded from the 2011 results. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Net Earnings and EPS Net earnings increased 30% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $48 million or $0.93 per diluted common share. Net earnings in the fourth quarter were impacted by earnings from discontinued operations of $0.4 million in 2011 and losses of $4 million in 2010. The earnings from discontinued operations in 2011 were due to $1 million of favorable insurance reserve developments.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FMS EBT increased 41% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $70 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, acquisitions and improved used vehicle sales results. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older fleet, investments in sales and marketing initiatives, and higher compensation related expenses. Commercial rental performance improved 54% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 31% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 18%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $7 million primarily due to higher pricing and demand. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 23%.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Financing activities 504,202 78,166 (542,016 ) Investing activities (1,657,172 ) (982,464 ) (448,610 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3,219 1,723 1,794 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (107,795 ) 125,459 (3,876 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.04 billion in 2011 compared with $1.03 billion in 2010 because of higher cash based earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital needs. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $504 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 due to higher borrowing needs to fund acquisitions and capital spending. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.66 billion in 2011 compared with $982 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2011. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Sales of revenue earning equipment 290,336 220,843 211,002 Sales of operating property and equipment 9,905 13,844 4,634 Collections on direct finance leases 62,224 61,767 65,242 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 37,395 Other, net 3,178 209 Total cash generated 1,441,816 1,327,666 1,266,043 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,698,589 ) (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) Free cash flow $ (256,773 ) 257,574 614,090 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Free cash flow decreased to negative $257 million in 2011 compared with positive $258 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2012 to be approximately $430 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line as well as the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 1,067,025 646,671 547,750 Commercial rental 622,181 378,678 7,436 1,689,206 1,025,349 555,186 Operating property and equipment 70,673 62,302 56,216 Total capital expenditures (1) 1,759,879 1,087,651 611,402 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (61,290 ) (17,559 ) 40,551 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,698,589 1,070,092 651,953 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions in 2011 of $37 million in assets held under capital leases resulting from a sale leaseback transaction. Non cash additions also exclude approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 because of higher full service lease vehicle spending for new business and replacements of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the rental fleet. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $2.15 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional debt financing. Working Capital 2011 2010 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,088,173 $ 1,023,301 Current liabilities 1,173,823 1,131,519 Working capital $ (85,650 ) $ (108,218 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(86) million at December 31, 2011 compared with $(108) million at December 31, 2010. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a net decrease of $146 million in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and cash. Excluding the decrease in short term debt, other working capital components decreased $123 million primarily due to a lower cash balance as of the end of 2011. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

As part of managements evaluation of segment operating performance, we define the primary measurement of our segment financial performance as Earnings Before Tax (EBT) from continuing operations, which includes an allocation of Central Support Services (CSS) and excludes restructuring and other charges, net and other items we do not believe are representative of the ongoing operations of the segment. CSS represents those costs incurred to support all business segments, including human resources, finance, corporate services and public affairs, information technology, health and safety, legal and corporate communications. The objective of the EBT measurement is to provide clarity on the profitability of each business segment and, ultimately, to hold leadership of each business segment and each operating segment within each business segment accountable for their allocated share of CSS costs. Segment results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations that would have occurred had each segment been an independent, stand alone entity during the periods presented. Certain costs are considered to be overhead not attributable to any segment and remain unallocated in CSS. Included within the unallocated overhead remaining within CSS are the costs for investor relations, public affairs and certain executive compensation. See Note 29, Segment Reporting, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a description of how the remainder of CSS costs are allocated to the business segments. 26 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Total revenue increased 14% in 2011 to $4.22 billion and increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) increased 10% in 2011 to $3.14 billion and increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: 2011 2010 Total Operating Total Operating Acquisitions 4% 5% % % Organic including price and volume 4 4 FMS fuel 5 3 Foreign exchange 1 1 1 1 Total increase 14% 10% 4% 1% 2011 versus 2010 Fuel services revenue increased 25% in 2011 due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Full service lease revenue increased 3% in 2011 reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions. We expect favorable full service lease comparisons to continue next year primarily due to acquisitions as well as new sales activity. Commercial rental revenue increased 38% in 2011 reflecting improved global market demand and higher pricing. We expect favorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics on our global fleet: Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 434,043 332,077 265,143 31% 25% Lease customer rental revenue (1) $ 288,514 193,006 165,915 49% 16% Average commercial rental power fleet size in service (2), (3) 28,500 23,800 23,000 20% 3% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 77.6% 76.1% 68.0% 150 bps 810 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS EBT increased 45% in 2011 to $250 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher compensation related expenses as well as higher maintenance costs on an older fleet. Commercial rental performance improved 66% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 23% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 10%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $49 million primarily due to higher pricing. The improvements in our commercial rental and used vehicle sales activities allowed us to better leverage our fixed costs. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 17%. 2010 versus 2009 Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010 from 68.0% in 2009. FMS EBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. The items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved by $42 million primarily due to higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the previous table include the following non revenue earning equipment for the global fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Change Number of Units 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 2,600 800 700 225% 14% No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 6,300 5,200 6,900 21 (25) Other NLE units 2,600 2,000 2,900 30 (31) Total 11,500 8,000 10,500 44% (24)% NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2011, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2011, the number of NLE units increased because of higher used vehicle inventory levels and increased levels of vehicle replacement activity. For 2010, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. We expect NLE levels in 2012 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

The TLC acquisition increased SCS EBT by 27% during 2011. SCS EBT also benefited from higher freight volumes across all industries, new business, and favorable insurance development. These benefits were partially offset by increased compensation related expenses. 2010 versus 2009 SCS EBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts, and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs.

The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months endedDecember 31, 2011 Total Operating Acquisitions 10% 12% Organic including price and volume 3 4 FMS fuel 3 Subcontracted transportation 1 Total increase 17% 16% EBT increased 47% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $73 million. The increase in EBT was primarily driven by improved commercial rental performance and acquisitions. Acquisitions accounted for 24% of year over year EBT growth in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, these increases were partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs as a result of improved company performance. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results. EBT also included acquisition related restructuring and other charges of $3 million related to our Hill Hire integration efforts. Excluding these charges, comparable EBT increased 45% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $76 million. Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) from Continuing Operations Earnings from continuing operations increased 15% to $48 million and EPS from continuing operations increased 15% to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 included the $2.4 million or $0.05 per diluted common share acquisition related restructuring and other charges. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share benefit related to certain tax benefits partially offset by restructuring and other items. Excluding these items, comparable earnings and EPS from continuing operations increased 48% to $50 million and 49% to $0.97 per diluted common share, respectively. We believe that comparable EBT, comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable EPS from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. See Note (S), Other Items Impacting Comparability, for information regarding items excluded from the 2011 results. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Net Earnings and EPS Net earnings increased 30% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $48 million or $0.93 per diluted common share. Net earnings in the fourth quarter were impacted by earnings from discontinued operations of $0.4 million in 2011 and losses of $4 million in 2010. The earnings from discontinued operations in 2011 were due to $1 million of favorable insurance reserve developments.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FMS EBT increased 41% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $70 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, acquisitions and improved used vehicle sales results. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older fleet, investments in sales and marketing initiatives, and higher compensation related expenses. Commercial rental performance improved 54% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 31% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 18%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $7 million primarily due to higher pricing and demand. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 23%.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Financing activities 504,202 78,166 (542,016 ) Investing activities (1,657,172 ) (982,464 ) (448,610 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3,219 1,723 1,794 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (107,795 ) 125,459 (3,876 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.04 billion in 2011 compared with $1.03 billion in 2010 because of higher cash based earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital needs. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $504 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 due to higher borrowing needs to fund acquisitions and capital spending. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.66 billion in 2011 compared with $982 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2011. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Sales of revenue earning equipment 290,336 220,843 211,002 Sales of operating property and equipment 9,905 13,844 4,634 Collections on direct finance leases 62,224 61,767 65,242 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 37,395 Other, net 3,178 209 Total cash generated 1,441,816 1,327,666 1,266,043 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,698,589 ) (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) Free cash flow $ (256,773 ) 257,574 614,090 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Free cash flow decreased to negative $257 million in 2011 compared with positive $258 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2012 to be approximately $430 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line as well as the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 1,067,025 646,671 547,750 Commercial rental 622,181 378,678 7,436 1,689,206 1,025,349 555,186 Operating property and equipment 70,673 62,302 56,216 Total capital expenditures (1) 1,759,879 1,087,651 611,402 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (61,290 ) (17,559 ) 40,551 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,698,589 1,070,092 651,953 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions in 2011 of $37 million in assets held under capital leases resulting from a sale leaseback transaction. Non cash additions also exclude approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 because of higher full service lease vehicle spending for new business and replacements of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the rental fleet. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $2.15 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional debt financing. Working Capital 2011 2010 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,088,173 $ 1,023,301 Current liabilities 1,173,823 1,131,519 Working capital $ (85,650 ) $ (108,218 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(86) million at December 31, 2011 compared with $(108) million at December 31, 2010. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a net decrease of $146 million in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and cash. Excluding the decrease in short term debt, other working capital components decreased $123 million primarily due to a lower cash balance as of the end of 2011. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. Refer to Note 15, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our sale leaseback transactions.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Total revenue increased 14% in 2011 to $4.22 billion and increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) increased 10% in 2011 to $3.14 billion and increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion.

Full service lease revenue increased 3% in 2011 reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions. We expect favorable full service lease comparisons to continue next year primarily due to acquisitions as well as new sales activity. Commercial rental revenue increased 38% in 2011 reflecting improved global market demand and higher pricing. We expect favorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

FMS EBT increased 45% in 2011 to $250 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher compensation related expenses as well as higher maintenance costs on an older fleet. Commercial rental performance improved 66% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 23% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 10%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $49 million primarily due to higher pricing. The improvements in our commercial rental and used vehicle sales activities allowed us to better leverage our fixed costs. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 17%. 2010 versus 2009 Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010 from 68.0% in 2009. FMS EBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. The items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved by $42 million primarily due to higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the previous table include the following non revenue earning equipment for the global fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Change Number of Units 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 2,600 800 700 225% 14% No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 6,300 5,200 6,900 21 (25) Other NLE units 2,600 2,000 2,900 30 (31) Total 11,500 8,000 10,500 44% (24)% NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2011, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2011, the number of NLE units increased because of higher used vehicle inventory levels and increased levels of vehicle replacement activity. For 2010, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. We expect NLE levels in 2012 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

We record revenue on a gross basis when acting as principal and we record revenue on a net basis when acting as an agent. As a result, total revenue may fluctuate depending on our role in subcontracted transportation arrangements yet our profitability remains unchanged as we typically realize minimal profitability from subcontracting transportation. We deduct subcontracted transportation expense from total revenue to arrive at operating revenue. We use operating revenue and EBT as a percent of operating revenue, non GAAP financial measures, to evaluate the operating performance of our SCS business segment and as a measure of sales activity and profitability. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Total revenue increased 28% in 2011 to $1.61 billion and increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 28% in 2011 to $1.29 billion and increased 5% in 2010 to $1.00 billion.

The TLC acquisition increased SCS EBT by 27% during 2011. SCS EBT also benefited from higher freight volumes across all industries, new business, and favorable insurance development. These benefits were partially offset by increased compensation related expenses. 2010 versus 2009 SCS EBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts, and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs.

Operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation) increased 16% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $1.24 billion. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months endedDecember 31, 2011 Total Operating Acquisitions 10% 12% Organic including price and volume 3 4 FMS fuel 3 Subcontracted transportation 1 Total increase 17% 16% EBT increased 47% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $73 million. The increase in EBT was primarily driven by improved commercial rental performance and acquisitions. Acquisitions accounted for 24% of year over year EBT growth in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, these increases were partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs as a result of improved company performance. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results. EBT also included acquisition related restructuring and other charges of $3 million related to our Hill Hire integration efforts. Excluding these charges, comparable EBT increased 45% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $76 million. Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) from Continuing Operations Earnings from continuing operations increased 15% to $48 million and EPS from continuing operations increased 15% to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 included the $2.4 million or $0.05 per diluted common share acquisition related restructuring and other charges. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share benefit related to certain tax benefits partially offset by restructuring and other items. Excluding these items, comparable earnings and EPS from continuing operations increased 48% to $50 million and 49% to $0.97 per diluted common share, respectively. We believe that comparable EBT, comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable EPS from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. See Note (S), Other Items Impacting Comparability, for information regarding items excluded from the 2011 results. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Net Earnings and EPS Net earnings increased 30% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $48 million or $0.93 per diluted common share. Net earnings in the fourth quarter were impacted by earnings from discontinued operations of $0.4 million in 2011 and losses of $4 million in 2010. The earnings from discontinued operations in 2011 were due to $1 million of favorable insurance reserve developments.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FMS EBT increased 41% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $70 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, acquisitions and improved used vehicle sales results. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older fleet, investments in sales and marketing initiatives, and higher compensation related expenses. Commercial rental performance improved 54% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 31% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 18%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $7 million primarily due to higher pricing and demand. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 23%.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Financing activities 504,202 78,166 (542,016 ) Investing activities (1,657,172 ) (982,464 ) (448,610 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3,219 1,723 1,794 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (107,795 ) 125,459 (3,876 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.04 billion in 2011 compared with $1.03 billion in 2010 because of higher cash based earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital needs. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $504 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 due to higher borrowing needs to fund acquisitions and capital spending. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.66 billion in 2011 compared with $982 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2011. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Sales of revenue earning equipment 290,336 220,843 211,002 Sales of operating property and equipment 9,905 13,844 4,634 Collections on direct finance leases 62,224 61,767 65,242 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 37,395 Other, net 3,178 209 Total cash generated 1,441,816 1,327,666 1,266,043 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,698,589 ) (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) Free cash flow $ (256,773 ) 257,574 614,090 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Free cash flow decreased to negative $257 million in 2011 compared with positive $258 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2012 to be approximately $430 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line as well as the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 1,067,025 646,671 547,750 Commercial rental 622,181 378,678 7,436 1,689,206 1,025,349 555,186 Operating property and equipment 70,673 62,302 56,216 Total capital expenditures (1) 1,759,879 1,087,651 611,402 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (61,290 ) (17,559 ) 40,551 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,698,589 1,070,092 651,953 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions in 2011 of $37 million in assets held under capital leases resulting from a sale leaseback transaction. Non cash additions also exclude approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 because of higher full service lease vehicle spending for new business and replacements of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the rental fleet. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $2.15 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional debt financing. Working Capital 2011 2010 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,088,173 $ 1,023,301 Current liabilities 1,173,823 1,131,519 Working capital $ (85,650 ) $ (108,218 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(86) million at December 31, 2011 compared with $(108) million at December 31, 2010. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a net decrease of $146 million in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and cash. Excluding the decrease in short term debt, other working capital components decreased $123 million primarily due to a lower cash balance as of the end of 2011. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. Refer to Note 15, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our sale leaseback transactions.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Fuel services revenue, which is directly impacted by fluctuations in market fuel prices, is excluded from our operating revenue computation as fuel is largely a pass through to customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. Total revenue increased 14% in 2011 to $4.22 billion and increased 4% in 2010 to $3.71 billion. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) increased 10% in 2011 to $3.14 billion and increased 1% in 2010 to $2.85 billion. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: 2011 2010 Total Operating Total Operating Acquisitions 4% 5% % % Organic including price and volume 4 4 FMS fuel 5 3 Foreign exchange 1 1 1 1 Total increase 14% 10% 4% 1% 2011 versus 2010 Fuel services revenue increased 25% in 2011 due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Full service lease revenue increased 3% in 2011 reflecting the impact of recent acquisitions. We expect favorable full service lease comparisons to continue next year primarily due to acquisitions as well as new sales activity. Commercial rental revenue increased 38% in 2011 reflecting improved global market demand and higher pricing. We expect favorable commercial rental revenue comparisons to continue next year driven by higher demand and higher pricing on a larger fleet. 28 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

(2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS EBT increased 45% in 2011 to $250 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher compensation related expenses as well as higher maintenance costs on an older fleet. Commercial rental performance improved 66% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 23% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 10%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $49 million primarily due to higher pricing. The improvements in our commercial rental and used vehicle sales activities allowed us to better leverage our fixed costs. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 17%. 2010 versus 2009 Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010 from 68.0% in 2009. FMS EBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. The items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved by $42 million primarily due to higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2011, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2011, the number of NLE units increased because of higher used vehicle inventory levels and increased levels of vehicle replacement activity. For 2010, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. We expect NLE levels in 2012 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

The TLC acquisition increased SCS EBT by 27% during 2011. SCS EBT also benefited from higher freight volumes across all industries, new business, and favorable insurance development. These benefits were partially offset by increased compensation related expenses. 2010 versus 2009 SCS EBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts, and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs.

The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months endedDecember 31, 2011 Total Operating Acquisitions 10% 12% Organic including price and volume 3 4 FMS fuel 3 Subcontracted transportation 1 Total increase 17% 16% EBT increased 47% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $73 million. The increase in EBT was primarily driven by improved commercial rental performance and acquisitions. Acquisitions accounted for 24% of year over year EBT growth in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, these increases were partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs as a result of improved company performance. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results. EBT also included acquisition related restructuring and other charges of $3 million related to our Hill Hire integration efforts. Excluding these charges, comparable EBT increased 45% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $76 million. Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) from Continuing Operations Earnings from continuing operations increased 15% to $48 million and EPS from continuing operations increased 15% to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 included the $2.4 million or $0.05 per diluted common share acquisition related restructuring and other charges. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share benefit related to certain tax benefits partially offset by restructuring and other items. Excluding these items, comparable earnings and EPS from continuing operations increased 48% to $50 million and 49% to $0.97 per diluted common share, respectively. We believe that comparable EBT, comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable EPS from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. See Note (S), Other Items Impacting Comparability, for information regarding items excluded from the 2011 results. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Net Earnings and EPS Net earnings increased 30% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $48 million or $0.93 per diluted common share. Net earnings in the fourth quarter were impacted by earnings from discontinued operations of $0.4 million in 2011 and losses of $4 million in 2010. The earnings from discontinued operations in 2011 were due to $1 million of favorable insurance reserve developments.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FMS EBT increased 41% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $70 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, acquisitions and improved used vehicle sales results. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older fleet, investments in sales and marketing initiatives, and higher compensation related expenses. Commercial rental performance improved 54% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 31% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 18%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $7 million primarily due to higher pricing and demand. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 23%.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Financing activities 504,202 78,166 (542,016 ) Investing activities (1,657,172 ) (982,464 ) (448,610 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3,219 1,723 1,794 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (107,795 ) 125,459 (3,876 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.04 billion in 2011 compared with $1.03 billion in 2010 because of higher cash based earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital needs. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $504 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 due to higher borrowing needs to fund acquisitions and capital spending. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.66 billion in 2011 compared with $982 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2011. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Sales of revenue earning equipment 290,336 220,843 211,002 Sales of operating property and equipment 9,905 13,844 4,634 Collections on direct finance leases 62,224 61,767 65,242 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 37,395 Other, net 3,178 209 Total cash generated 1,441,816 1,327,666 1,266,043 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,698,589 ) (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) Free cash flow $ (256,773 ) 257,574 614,090 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Free cash flow decreased to negative $257 million in 2011 compared with positive $258 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2012 to be approximately $430 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line as well as the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 1,067,025 646,671 547,750 Commercial rental 622,181 378,678 7,436 1,689,206 1,025,349 555,186 Operating property and equipment 70,673 62,302 56,216 Total capital expenditures (1) 1,759,879 1,087,651 611,402 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (61,290 ) (17,559 ) 40,551 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,698,589 1,070,092 651,953 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions in 2011 of $37 million in assets held under capital leases resulting from a sale leaseback transaction. Non cash additions also exclude approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 because of higher full service lease vehicle spending for new business and replacements of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the rental fleet. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $2.15 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional debt financing. Working Capital 2011 2010 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,088,173 $ 1,023,301 Current liabilities 1,173,823 1,131,519 Working capital $ (85,650 ) $ (108,218 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(86) million at December 31, 2011 compared with $(108) million at December 31, 2010. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a net decrease of $146 million in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and cash. Excluding the decrease in short term debt, other working capital components decreased $123 million primarily due to a lower cash balance as of the end of 2011. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table provides rental statistics on our global fleet: Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Non lease customer rental revenue $ 434,043 332,077 265,143 31% 25% Lease customer rental revenue (1) $ 288,514 193,006 165,915 49% 16% Average commercial rental power fleet size in service (2), (3) 28,500 23,800 23,000 20% 3% Commercial rental utilization power fleet 77.6% 76.1% 68.0% 150 bps 810 bps (1) Lease customer rental revenue is revenue from rental vehicles provided to our existing full service lease customers, generally during peak periods in their operations. (2) Number of units rounded to nearest hundred and calculated using average counts. (3) Fleet size excluding trailers. FMS EBT increased 45% in 2011 to $250 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results and the impact of acquisitions. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher compensation related expenses as well as higher maintenance costs on an older fleet. Commercial rental performance improved 66% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 23% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 10%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $49 million primarily due to higher pricing. The improvements in our commercial rental and used vehicle sales activities allowed us to better leverage our fixed costs. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 17%. 2010 versus 2009 Fuel services revenue increased 15% in 2010 due to higher fuel prices passed through to customers. Full service lease revenue declined 3% and contract maintenance revenue declined 5% as a result of the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizings. Commercial rental revenue increased 22% in 2010 reflecting improving global market demand and higher pricing. The average global rental fleet increased 1% in 2010 in response to increased demand. Power fleet utilization increased to 76.1% in 2010 from 68.0% in 2009. FMS EBT increased 23% in 2010 to $172 million primarily due to better commercial rental performance, improved used vehicle sales results, and lower retirement plans expense. The items were partially offset by lower full service lease results and, to a lesser extent, higher compensation and depreciation expense. Commercial rental performance improved as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing. Used vehicle sales results improved by $42 million primarily due to higher pricing and a lower average inventory level. Retirement plan costs decreased $20 million because of improved performance in the overall stock market in 2009 which impacted 2010 pension expense. Full service lease performance was adversely impacted by increased maintenance costs on a relatively older fleet and the cumulative impact of customer fleet downsizing. Depreciation expense increased $10 million resulting from residual value changes and accelerated depreciation. 29 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Note: Average vehicle counts were computed using 24 point average based on monthly information. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the previous table include the following non revenue earning equipment for the global fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Change Number of Units 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 2,600 800 700 225% 14% No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 6,300 5,200 6,900 21 (25) Other NLE units 2,600 2,000 2,900 30 (31) Total 11,500 8,000 10,500 44% (24)% NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2011, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2011, the number of NLE units increased because of higher used vehicle inventory levels and increased levels of vehicle replacement activity. For 2010, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. We expect NLE levels in 2012 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

We record revenue on a gross basis when acting as principal and we record revenue on a net basis when acting as an agent. As a result, total revenue may fluctuate depending on our role in subcontracted transportation arrangements yet our profitability remains unchanged as we typically realize minimal profitability from subcontracting transportation. We deduct subcontracted transportation expense from total revenue to arrive at operating revenue. We use operating revenue and EBT as a percent of operating revenue, non GAAP financial measures, to evaluate the operating performance of our SCS business segment and as a measure of sales activity and profitability. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Total revenue increased 28% in 2011 to $1.61 billion and increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 28% in 2011 to $1.29 billion and increased 5% in 2010 to $1.00 billion. We expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue next year due to new sales activity and higher volumes. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: 2011 2010 Total Operating Total Operating TLC acquisition 20% 23% % % Subcontracted transportation 4 6 Organic including price and volume 2 3 1 2 Fuel cost pass throughs 1 1 1 1 Foreign exchange 1 1 2 2 Total increase 28% 28% 10% 5% 2011 versus 2010 SCS EBT increased 47% in 2011 to $69 million. The TLC acquisition increased SCS EBT by 27% during 2011. SCS EBT also benefited from higher freight volumes across all industries, new business, and favorable insurance development. These benefits were partially offset by increased compensation related expenses. 2010 versus 2009 SCS EBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts, and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs.

We record revenue on a gross basis when acting as principal and we record revenue on a net basis when acting as an agent. As a result, total revenue may fluctuate depending on our role in subcontracted transportation arrangements yet our profitability remains unchanged as we typically realize minimal profitability from subcontracting transportation. We deduct subcontracted transportation expense from total revenue to arrive at operating revenue. We use operating revenue and EBT as a percent of operating revenue, non GAAP financial measures, to evaluate the operating performance of our DCC business segment and as a measure of sales activity and profitability. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation) increased 16% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $1.24 billion. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months endedDecember 31, 2011 Total Operating Acquisitions 10% 12% Organic including price and volume 3 4 FMS fuel 3 Subcontracted transportation 1 Total increase 17% 16% EBT increased 47% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $73 million. The increase in EBT was primarily driven by improved commercial rental performance and acquisitions. Acquisitions accounted for 24% of year over year EBT growth in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, these increases were partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs as a result of improved company performance. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results. EBT also included acquisition related restructuring and other charges of $3 million related to our Hill Hire integration efforts. Excluding these charges, comparable EBT increased 45% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $76 million. Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) from Continuing Operations Earnings from continuing operations increased 15% to $48 million and EPS from continuing operations increased 15% to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 included the $2.4 million or $0.05 per diluted common share acquisition related restructuring and other charges. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share benefit related to certain tax benefits partially offset by restructuring and other items. Excluding these items, comparable earnings and EPS from continuing operations increased 48% to $50 million and 49% to $0.97 per diluted common share, respectively. We believe that comparable EBT, comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable EPS from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. See Note (S), Other Items Impacting Comparability, for information regarding items excluded from the 2011 results. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Net Earnings and EPS Net earnings increased 30% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $48 million or $0.93 per diluted common share. Net earnings in the fourth quarter were impacted by earnings from discontinued operations of $0.4 million in 2011 and losses of $4 million in 2010. The earnings from discontinued operations in 2011 were due to $1 million of favorable insurance reserve developments.

Commercial rental revenue increased 38% in the fourth quarter of 2011 reflecting improved global market demand and higher pricing. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FMS EBT increased 41% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $70 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, acquisitions and improved used vehicle sales results. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older fleet, investments in sales and marketing initiatives, and higher compensation related expenses. Commercial rental performance improved 54% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 31% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 18%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $7 million primarily due to higher pricing and demand. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 23%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $409 million. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $325 million.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Financing activities 504,202 78,166 (542,016 ) Investing activities (1,657,172 ) (982,464 ) (448,610 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3,219 1,723 1,794 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (107,795 ) 125,459 (3,876 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.04 billion in 2011 compared with $1.03 billion in 2010 because of higher cash based earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital needs. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $504 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 due to higher borrowing needs to fund acquisitions and capital spending. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.66 billion in 2011 compared with $982 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2011. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Sales of revenue earning equipment 290,336 220,843 211,002 Sales of operating property and equipment 9,905 13,844 4,634 Collections on direct finance leases 62,224 61,767 65,242 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 37,395 Other, net 3,178 209 Total cash generated 1,441,816 1,327,666 1,266,043 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,698,589 ) (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) Free cash flow $ (256,773 ) 257,574 614,090 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Free cash flow decreased to negative $257 million in 2011 compared with positive $258 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2012 to be approximately $430 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line as well as the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 1,067,025 646,671 547,750 Commercial rental 622,181 378,678 7,436 1,689,206 1,025,349 555,186 Operating property and equipment 70,673 62,302 56,216 Total capital expenditures (1) 1,759,879 1,087,651 611,402 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (61,290 ) (17,559 ) 40,551 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,698,589 1,070,092 651,953 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions in 2011 of $37 million in assets held under capital leases resulting from a sale leaseback transaction. Non cash additions also exclude approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 because of higher full service lease vehicle spending for new business and replacements of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the rental fleet. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $2.15 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional debt financing. Working Capital 2011 2010 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,088,173 $ 1,023,301 Current liabilities 1,173,823 1,131,519 Working capital $ (85,650 ) $ (108,218 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(86) million at December 31, 2011 compared with $(108) million at December 31, 2010. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a net decrease of $146 million in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and cash. Excluding the decrease in short term debt, other working capital components decreased $123 million primarily due to a lower cash balance as of the end of 2011. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. Refer to Note 15, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our sale leaseback transactions.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

Note: Average vehicle counts were computed using 24 point average based on monthly information. 30 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the previous table include the following non revenue earning equipment for the global fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Change Number of Units 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 2,600 800 700 225% 14% No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 6,300 5,200 6,900 21 (25) Other NLE units 2,600 2,000 2,900 30 (31) Total 11,500 8,000 10,500 44% (24)% NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2011, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2011, the number of NLE units increased because of higher used vehicle inventory levels and increased levels of vehicle replacement activity. For 2010, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. We expect NLE levels in 2012 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

We record revenue on a gross basis when acting as principal and we record revenue on a net basis when acting as an agent. As a result, total revenue may fluctuate depending on our role in subcontracted transportation arrangements yet our profitability remains unchanged as we typically realize minimal profitability from subcontracting transportation. We deduct subcontracted transportation expense from total revenue to arrive at operating revenue. We use operating revenue and EBT as a percent of operating revenue, non GAAP financial measures, to evaluate the operating performance of our SCS business segment and as a measure of sales activity and profitability. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Total revenue increased 28% in 2011 to $1.61 billion and increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 28% in 2011 to $1.29 billion and increased 5% in 2010 to $1.00 billion. We expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue next year due to new sales activity and higher volumes. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: 2011 2010 Total Operating Total Operating TLC acquisition 20% 23% % % Subcontracted transportation 4 6 Organic including price and volume 2 3 1 2 Fuel cost pass throughs 1 1 1 1 Foreign exchange 1 1 2 2 Total increase 28% 28% 10% 5% 2011 versus 2010 SCS EBT increased 47% in 2011 to $69 million. The TLC acquisition increased SCS EBT by 27% during 2011. SCS EBT also benefited from higher freight volumes across all industries, new business, and favorable insurance development. These benefits were partially offset by increased compensation related expenses. 2010 versus 2009 SCS EBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts, and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Total revenue increased 24% in 2011 to $601 million and increased 2% in 2010 to $483 million. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 21% in 2011 to $567 million and increased 3% in 2010 to $469 million. We expect favorable revenue comparisons next year due to new sales activity and higher volumes.

Operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation) increased 16% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $1.24 billion. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months endedDecember 31, 2011 Total Operating Acquisitions 10% 12% Organic including price and volume 3 4 FMS fuel 3 Subcontracted transportation 1 Total increase 17% 16% EBT increased 47% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $73 million. The increase in EBT was primarily driven by improved commercial rental performance and acquisitions. Acquisitions accounted for 24% of year over year EBT growth in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, these increases were partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs as a result of improved company performance. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results. EBT also included acquisition related restructuring and other charges of $3 million related to our Hill Hire integration efforts. Excluding these charges, comparable EBT increased 45% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $76 million. Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) from Continuing Operations Earnings from continuing operations increased 15% to $48 million and EPS from continuing operations increased 15% to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 included the $2.4 million or $0.05 per diluted common share acquisition related restructuring and other charges. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share benefit related to certain tax benefits partially offset by restructuring and other items. Excluding these items, comparable earnings and EPS from continuing operations increased 48% to $50 million and 49% to $0.97 per diluted common share, respectively. We believe that comparable EBT, comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable EPS from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. See Note (S), Other Items Impacting Comparability, for information regarding items excluded from the 2011 results. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Net Earnings and EPS Net earnings increased 30% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $48 million or $0.93 per diluted common share. Net earnings in the fourth quarter were impacted by earnings from discontinued operations of $0.4 million in 2011 and losses of $4 million in 2010. The earnings from discontinued operations in 2011 were due to $1 million of favorable insurance reserve developments.

Commercial rental revenue increased 38% in the fourth quarter of 2011 reflecting improved global market demand and higher pricing. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FMS EBT increased 41% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $70 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, acquisitions and improved used vehicle sales results. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older fleet, investments in sales and marketing initiatives, and higher compensation related expenses. Commercial rental performance improved 54% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 31% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 18%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $7 million primarily due to higher pricing and demand. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 23%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $409 million. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $325 million.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Financing activities 504,202 78,166 (542,016 ) Investing activities (1,657,172 ) (982,464 ) (448,610 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3,219 1,723 1,794 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (107,795 ) 125,459 (3,876 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.04 billion in 2011 compared with $1.03 billion in 2010 because of higher cash based earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital needs. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $504 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 due to higher borrowing needs to fund acquisitions and capital spending. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.66 billion in 2011 compared with $982 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2011. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Sales of revenue earning equipment 290,336 220,843 211,002 Sales of operating property and equipment 9,905 13,844 4,634 Collections on direct finance leases 62,224 61,767 65,242 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 37,395 Other, net 3,178 209 Total cash generated 1,441,816 1,327,666 1,266,043 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,698,589 ) (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) Free cash flow $ (256,773 ) 257,574 614,090 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Free cash flow decreased to negative $257 million in 2011 compared with positive $258 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2012 to be approximately $430 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line as well as the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 1,067,025 646,671 547,750 Commercial rental 622,181 378,678 7,436 1,689,206 1,025,349 555,186 Operating property and equipment 70,673 62,302 56,216 Total capital expenditures (1) 1,759,879 1,087,651 611,402 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (61,290 ) (17,559 ) 40,551 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,698,589 1,070,092 651,953 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions in 2011 of $37 million in assets held under capital leases resulting from a sale leaseback transaction. Non cash additions also exclude approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 because of higher full service lease vehicle spending for new business and replacements of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the rental fleet. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $2.15 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional debt financing. Working Capital 2011 2010 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,088,173 $ 1,023,301 Current liabilities 1,173,823 1,131,519 Working capital $ (85,650 ) $ (108,218 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(86) million at December 31, 2011 compared with $(108) million at December 31, 2010. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a net decrease of $146 million in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and cash. Excluding the decrease in short term debt, other working capital components decreased $123 million primarily due to a lower cash balance as of the end of 2011. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. Refer to Note 15, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our sale leaseback transactions. Guarantees. Refer to Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our agreements involving guarantees. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The totals in the previous table include the following non revenue earning equipment for the global fleet (number of units rounded to the nearest hundred): Change Number of Units 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 Not yet earning revenue (NYE) 2,600 800 700 225% 14% No longer earning revenue (NLE): Units held for sale 6,300 5,200 6,900 21 (25) Other NLE units 2,600 2,000 2,900 30 (31) Total 11,500 8,000 10,500 44% (24)% NYE units represent new vehicles on hand that are being prepared for deployment to a lease customer or into the rental fleet. Preparations include activities such as adding lift gates, paint, decals, cargo area and refrigeration equipment. For 2011, the number of NYE units increased compared with prior year reflecting new lease sales. NLE units represent all vehicles held for sale and vehicles for which no revenue has been earned in the previous 30 days. Accordingly, these vehicles may be temporarily out of service, being prepared for sale or awaiting redeployment. For 2011, the number of NLE units increased because of higher used vehicle inventory levels and increased levels of vehicle replacement activity. For 2010, the number of NLE units decreased because of lower used vehicle inventory levels and higher rental utilization. We expect NLE levels in 2012 to be slightly higher due to increased levels of vehicle replacement activity from both our lease and rental fleets.

We record revenue on a gross basis when acting as principal and we record revenue on a net basis when acting as an agent. As a result, total revenue may fluctuate depending on our role in subcontracted transportation arrangements yet our profitability remains unchanged as we typically realize minimal profitability from subcontracting transportation. We deduct subcontracted transportation expense from total revenue to arrive at operating revenue. We use operating revenue and EBT as a percent of operating revenue, non GAAP financial measures, to evaluate the operating performance of our SCS business segment and as a measure of sales activity and profitability. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Total revenue increased 28% in 2011 to $1.61 billion and increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 28% in 2011 to $1.29 billion and increased 5% in 2010 to $1.00 billion. We expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue next year due to new sales activity and higher volumes.

The TLC acquisition increased SCS EBT by 27% during 2011. SCS EBT also benefited from higher freight volumes across all industries, new business, and favorable insurance development. These benefits were partially offset by increased compensation related expenses. 2010 versus 2009 SCS EBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts, and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Total revenue increased 24% in 2011 to $601 million and increased 2% in 2010 to $483 million. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 21% in 2011 to $567 million and increased 3% in 2010 to $469 million. We expect favorable revenue comparisons next year due to new sales activity and higher volumes.

Operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation) increased 16% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $1.24 billion. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months endedDecember 31, 2011 Total Operating Acquisitions 10% 12% Organic including price and volume 3 4 FMS fuel 3 Subcontracted transportation 1 Total increase 17% 16% EBT increased 47% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $73 million. The increase in EBT was primarily driven by improved commercial rental performance and acquisitions. Acquisitions accounted for 24% of year over year EBT growth in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, these increases were partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs as a result of improved company performance. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results. EBT also included acquisition related restructuring and other charges of $3 million related to our Hill Hire integration efforts. Excluding these charges, comparable EBT increased 45% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $76 million. Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) from Continuing Operations Earnings from continuing operations increased 15% to $48 million and EPS from continuing operations increased 15% to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 included the $2.4 million or $0.05 per diluted common share acquisition related restructuring and other charges. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share benefit related to certain tax benefits partially offset by restructuring and other items. Excluding these items, comparable earnings and EPS from continuing operations increased 48% to $50 million and 49% to $0.97 per diluted common share, respectively. We believe that comparable EBT, comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable EPS from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. See Note (S), Other Items Impacting Comparability, for information regarding items excluded from the 2011 results. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Net Earnings and EPS Net earnings increased 30% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $48 million or $0.93 per diluted common share. Net earnings in the fourth quarter were impacted by earnings from discontinued operations of $0.4 million in 2011 and losses of $4 million in 2010. The earnings from discontinued operations in 2011 were due to $1 million of favorable insurance reserve developments.

Three months ended December 31, 2011 Total Operating Acquisitions 6% 7% Organic including price and volume 3 5 FMS fuel 4 Total increase 13% 12% Fuel services revenue increased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2011 due to higher prices passed through to customers. Full service lease revenue increased 5% in the fourth quarter of 2011 from to the impact of recent acquisitions. Commercial rental revenue increased 38% in the fourth quarter of 2011 reflecting improved global market demand and higher pricing. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FMS EBT increased 41% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $70 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, acquisitions and improved used vehicle sales results. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older fleet, investments in sales and marketing initiatives, and higher compensation related expenses. Commercial rental performance improved 54% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 31% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 18%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $7 million primarily due to higher pricing and demand. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 23%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $409 million. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $325 million.

Central Support Services Total CSS costs increased 8% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $52 million primarily due to higher compensation related expenses, investments in information technology initiatives and increased professional fees. Unallocated CSS costs increased 3% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $11 million primarily due to higher investments in information technology initiatives. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Financing activities 504,202 78,166 (542,016 ) Investing activities (1,657,172 ) (982,464 ) (448,610 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3,219 1,723 1,794 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (107,795 ) 125,459 (3,876 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.04 billion in 2011 compared with $1.03 billion in 2010 because of higher cash based earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital needs. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $504 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 due to higher borrowing needs to fund acquisitions and capital spending. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.66 billion in 2011 compared with $982 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2011. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Sales of revenue earning equipment 290,336 220,843 211,002 Sales of operating property and equipment 9,905 13,844 4,634 Collections on direct finance leases 62,224 61,767 65,242 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 37,395 Other, net 3,178 209 Total cash generated 1,441,816 1,327,666 1,266,043 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,698,589 ) (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) Free cash flow $ (256,773 ) 257,574 614,090 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Free cash flow decreased to negative $257 million in 2011 compared with positive $258 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2012 to be approximately $430 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line as well as the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 1,067,025 646,671 547,750 Commercial rental 622,181 378,678 7,436 1,689,206 1,025,349 555,186 Operating property and equipment 70,673 62,302 56,216 Total capital expenditures (1) 1,759,879 1,087,651 611,402 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (61,290 ) (17,559 ) 40,551 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,698,589 1,070,092 651,953 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions in 2011 of $37 million in assets held under capital leases resulting from a sale leaseback transaction. Non cash additions also exclude approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 because of higher full service lease vehicle spending for new business and replacements of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the rental fleet. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $2.15 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional debt financing. Working Capital 2011 2010 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,088,173 $ 1,023,301 Current liabilities 1,173,823 1,131,519 Working capital $ (85,650 ) $ (108,218 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(86) million at December 31, 2011 compared with $(108) million at December 31, 2010. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a net decrease of $146 million in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and cash. Excluding the decrease in short term debt, other working capital components decreased $123 million primarily due to a lower cash balance as of the end of 2011. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Total revenue increased 28% in 2011 to $1.61 billion and increased 10% in 2010 to $1.25 billion. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 28% in 2011 to $1.29 billion and increased 5% in 2010 to $1.00 billion. We expect favorable revenue comparisons to continue next year due to new sales activity and higher volumes. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: 2011 2010 Total Operating Total Operating TLC acquisition 20% 23% % % Subcontracted transportation 4 6 Organic including price and volume 2 3 1 2 Fuel cost pass throughs 1 1 1 1 Foreign exchange 1 1 2 2 Total increase 28% 28% 10% 5% 2011 versus 2010 SCS EBT increased 47% in 2011 to $69 million. The TLC acquisition increased SCS EBT by 27% during 2011. SCS EBT also benefited from higher freight volumes across all industries, new business, and favorable insurance development. These benefits were partially offset by increased compensation related expenses. 2010 versus 2009 SCS EBT increased 32% in 2010 to $47 million primarily due to improved operating performance, particularly in high tech accounts, and higher automotive production volumes partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs. Dedicated Contract Carriage Change 2011 2010 2009 2011/2010 2010/2009 (Dollars in thousands) Operating revenue (1) $ 566,643 468,547 456,598 21% 3% Subcontracted transportation 34,031 14,036 14,358 142 (2) Total revenue $ 600,674 482,583 470,956 24% 2% Segment EBT $ 32,528 30,966 37,643 5% (18)% Segment EBT as a % of total revenue 5.4 % 6.4 % 8.0 % (100) bps (160) bps Segment EBT as a % of operating revenue (1) 5.7 % 6.6 % 8.2 % (90) bps (160) bps Memo: Fuel costs (2) $ 127,273 83,928 69,858 52% 20% (1) In DCC transportation management arrangements we may act as a principal or as an agent in purchasing transportation on behalf of our customer. We record revenue on a gross basis when acting as principal and we record revenue on a net basis when acting as an agent. As a result, total revenue may fluctuate depending on our role in subcontracted transportation arrangements yet our profitability remains unchanged as we typically realize minimal profitability from subcontracting transportation. We deduct subcontracted transportation expense from total revenue to arrive at operating revenue. We use operating revenue and EBT as a percent of operating revenue, non GAAP financial measures, to evaluate the operating performance of our DCC business segment and as a measure of sales activity and profitability. (2) Fuel costs are largely a pass through to customers and therefore have a direct impact on revenue. 32 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Total revenue increased 24% in 2011 to $601 million and increased 2% in 2010 to $483 million. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 21% in 2011 to $567 million and increased 3% in 2010 to $469 million. We expect favorable revenue comparisons next year due to new sales activity and higher volumes.

Operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation) increased 16% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $1.24 billion. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months endedDecember 31, 2011 Total Operating Acquisitions 10% 12% Organic including price and volume 3 4 FMS fuel 3 Subcontracted transportation 1 Total increase 17% 16% EBT increased 47% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $73 million. The increase in EBT was primarily driven by improved commercial rental performance and acquisitions. Acquisitions accounted for 24% of year over year EBT growth in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, these increases were partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs as a result of improved company performance. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results. EBT also included acquisition related restructuring and other charges of $3 million related to our Hill Hire integration efforts. Excluding these charges, comparable EBT increased 45% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $76 million. Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) from Continuing Operations Earnings from continuing operations increased 15% to $48 million and EPS from continuing operations increased 15% to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 included the $2.4 million or $0.05 per diluted common share acquisition related restructuring and other charges. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share benefit related to certain tax benefits partially offset by restructuring and other items. Excluding these items, comparable earnings and EPS from continuing operations increased 48% to $50 million and 49% to $0.97 per diluted common share, respectively. We believe that comparable EBT, comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable EPS from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. See Note (S), Other Items Impacting Comparability, for information regarding items excluded from the 2011 results. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Net Earnings and EPS Net earnings increased 30% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $48 million or $0.93 per diluted common share. Net earnings in the fourth quarter were impacted by earnings from discontinued operations of $0.4 million in 2011 and losses of $4 million in 2010. The earnings from discontinued operations in 2011 were due to $1 million of favorable insurance reserve developments.

Commercial rental revenue increased 38% in the fourth quarter of 2011 reflecting improved global market demand and higher pricing. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FMS EBT increased 41% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $70 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, acquisitions and improved used vehicle sales results. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older fleet, investments in sales and marketing initiatives, and higher compensation related expenses. Commercial rental performance improved 54% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 31% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 18%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $7 million primarily due to higher pricing and demand. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 23%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $409 million. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $325 million.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Financing activities 504,202 78,166 (542,016 ) Investing activities (1,657,172 ) (982,464 ) (448,610 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3,219 1,723 1,794 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (107,795 ) 125,459 (3,876 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.04 billion in 2011 compared with $1.03 billion in 2010 because of higher cash based earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital needs. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $504 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 due to higher borrowing needs to fund acquisitions and capital spending. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.66 billion in 2011 compared with $982 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2011. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Sales of revenue earning equipment 290,336 220,843 211,002 Sales of operating property and equipment 9,905 13,844 4,634 Collections on direct finance leases 62,224 61,767 65,242 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 37,395 Other, net 3,178 209 Total cash generated 1,441,816 1,327,666 1,266,043 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,698,589 ) (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) Free cash flow $ (256,773 ) 257,574 614,090 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Free cash flow decreased to negative $257 million in 2011 compared with positive $258 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2012 to be approximately $430 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line as well as the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 1,067,025 646,671 547,750 Commercial rental 622,181 378,678 7,436 1,689,206 1,025,349 555,186 Operating property and equipment 70,673 62,302 56,216 Total capital expenditures (1) 1,759,879 1,087,651 611,402 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (61,290 ) (17,559 ) 40,551 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,698,589 1,070,092 651,953 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions in 2011 of $37 million in assets held under capital leases resulting from a sale leaseback transaction. Non cash additions also exclude approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 because of higher full service lease vehicle spending for new business and replacements of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the rental fleet. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $2.15 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional debt financing. Working Capital 2011 2010 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,088,173 $ 1,023,301 Current liabilities 1,173,823 1,131,519 Working capital $ (85,650 ) $ (108,218 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(86) million at December 31, 2011 compared with $(108) million at December 31, 2010. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a net decrease of $146 million in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and cash. Excluding the decrease in short term debt, other working capital components decreased $123 million primarily due to a lower cash balance as of the end of 2011. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. Refer to Note 15, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our sale leaseback transactions. Guarantees. Refer to Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our agreements involving guarantees. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Total revenue increased 24% in 2011 to $601 million and increased 2% in 2010 to $483 million. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 21% in 2011 to $567 million and increased 3% in 2010 to $469 million. We expect favorable revenue comparisons next year due to new sales activity and higher volumes. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: 2011 2010 Total Operating Total Operating Scully acquisition 18% 15% % % Fuel cost pass throughs 5 5 3 3 Subcontracted transportation 1 Organic including price and volume 1 (1) Total increase 24% 21% 2% 3% 2011 versus 2010 DCC EBT increased 5% in 2011 to $33 million reflecting lower self insurance costs from favorable development related to prior year claims and the impact of the Scully acquisition, partially offset by lower operating performance and higher compensation related expenses. 2010 versus 2009 DCC EBT decreased 18% in 2010 to $31 million primarily due to investments associated with new technology initiatives, higher compensation costs, increased self insurance costs from unfavorable development related to prior year claims, and lower operating performance caused by increased driver costs.

Operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation) increased 16% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $1.24 billion. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months endedDecember 31, 2011 Total Operating Acquisitions 10% 12% Organic including price and volume 3 4 FMS fuel 3 Subcontracted transportation 1 Total increase 17% 16% EBT increased 47% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $73 million. The increase in EBT was primarily driven by improved commercial rental performance and acquisitions. Acquisitions accounted for 24% of year over year EBT growth in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, these increases were partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs as a result of improved company performance. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results. EBT also included acquisition related restructuring and other charges of $3 million related to our Hill Hire integration efforts. Excluding these charges, comparable EBT increased 45% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $76 million. Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) from Continuing Operations Earnings from continuing operations increased 15% to $48 million and EPS from continuing operations increased 15% to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 included the $2.4 million or $0.05 per diluted common share acquisition related restructuring and other charges. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share benefit related to certain tax benefits partially offset by restructuring and other items. Excluding these items, comparable earnings and EPS from continuing operations increased 48% to $50 million and 49% to $0.97 per diluted common share, respectively. We believe that comparable EBT, comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable EPS from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. See Note (S), Other Items Impacting Comparability, for information regarding items excluded from the 2011 results. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Net Earnings and EPS Net earnings increased 30% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $48 million or $0.93 per diluted common share. Net earnings in the fourth quarter were impacted by earnings from discontinued operations of $0.4 million in 2011 and losses of $4 million in 2010. The earnings from discontinued operations in 2011 were due to $1 million of favorable insurance reserve developments.

Three months ended December 31, 2011 Total Operating Acquisitions 6% 7% Organic including price and volume 3 5 FMS fuel 4 Total increase 13% 12% Fuel services revenue increased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2011 due to higher prices passed through to customers. Full service lease revenue increased 5% in the fourth quarter of 2011 from to the impact of recent acquisitions. Commercial rental revenue increased 38% in the fourth quarter of 2011 reflecting improved global market demand and higher pricing. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FMS EBT increased 41% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $70 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, acquisitions and improved used vehicle sales results. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older fleet, investments in sales and marketing initiatives, and higher compensation related expenses. Commercial rental performance improved 54% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 31% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 18%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $7 million primarily due to higher pricing and demand. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 23%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $409 million. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $325 million. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months ended December 31, 2011 Total Operating TLC acquisition 18% 21% Subcontracted transportation 4 Organic including price and volume 5 6 Foreign exchange (1) (1) Total increase 26% 26% SCS EBT increased 44% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $18 million. The TLC acquisition increased SCS EBT by 11% during the fourth quarter of 2011. SCS EBT also benefited from favorable prior year insurance development and new business. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 29% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $157 million. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 23% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $147 million.

Central Support Services Total CSS costs increased 8% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $52 million primarily due to higher compensation related expenses, investments in information technology initiatives and increased professional fees. Unallocated CSS costs increased 3% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $11 million primarily due to higher investments in information technology initiatives. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Financing activities 504,202 78,166 (542,016 ) Investing activities (1,657,172 ) (982,464 ) (448,610 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3,219 1,723 1,794 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (107,795 ) 125,459 (3,876 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.04 billion in 2011 compared with $1.03 billion in 2010 because of higher cash based earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital needs. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $504 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 due to higher borrowing needs to fund acquisitions and capital spending. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.66 billion in 2011 compared with $982 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2011. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Sales of revenue earning equipment 290,336 220,843 211,002 Sales of operating property and equipment 9,905 13,844 4,634 Collections on direct finance leases 62,224 61,767 65,242 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 37,395 Other, net 3,178 209 Total cash generated 1,441,816 1,327,666 1,266,043 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,698,589 ) (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) Free cash flow $ (256,773 ) 257,574 614,090 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Free cash flow decreased to negative $257 million in 2011 compared with positive $258 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2012 to be approximately $430 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line as well as the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 1,067,025 646,671 547,750 Commercial rental 622,181 378,678 7,436 1,689,206 1,025,349 555,186 Operating property and equipment 70,673 62,302 56,216 Total capital expenditures (1) 1,759,879 1,087,651 611,402 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (61,290 ) (17,559 ) 40,551 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,698,589 1,070,092 651,953 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions in 2011 of $37 million in assets held under capital leases resulting from a sale leaseback transaction. Non cash additions also exclude approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 because of higher full service lease vehicle spending for new business and replacements of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the rental fleet. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $2.15 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional debt financing. Working Capital 2011 2010 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,088,173 $ 1,023,301 Current liabilities 1,173,823 1,131,519 Working capital $ (85,650 ) $ (108,218 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(86) million at December 31, 2011 compared with $(108) million at December 31, 2010. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a net decrease of $146 million in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and cash. Excluding the decrease in short term debt, other working capital components decreased $123 million primarily due to a lower cash balance as of the end of 2011. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. Refer to Note 15, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our sale leaseback transactions.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FOURTH QUARTER CONSOLIDATED RESULTS 000000000000 000000000000 000000000000 Three months endedDecember 31, Change 2011 2010 2011/ 2010 (Dollars in thousands, exceptper share amounts) Total revenue $ 1,541,094 1,313,426 17% Operating revenue 1,236,992 1,061,939 16 Pre tax earnings from continuing operations $ 73,112 49,608 47 Earnings from continuing operations 47,664 41,462 15 Net earnings 48,095 37,121 30 Earnings per common share Diluted Continuing operations $ 0.92 0.80 15% Net earnings $ 0.93 0.72 29% Revenue Total revenue increased 17% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $1.54 billion. Operating revenue (revenue excluding FMS fuel and all subcontracted transportation) increased 16% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $1.24 billion. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months endedDecember 31, 2011 Total Operating Acquisitions 10% 12% Organic including price and volume 3 4 FMS fuel 3 Subcontracted transportation 1 Total increase 17% 16% EBT increased 47% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $73 million. The increase in EBT was primarily driven by improved commercial rental performance and acquisitions. Acquisitions accounted for 24% of year over year EBT growth in the fourth quarter of 2011. However, these increases were partially offset by higher incentive based compensation costs as a result of improved company performance. See Operating Results by Business Segment for a further discussion of operating results. EBT also included acquisition related restructuring and other charges of $3 million related to our Hill Hire integration efforts. Excluding these charges, comparable EBT increased 45% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $76 million. Earnings and Diluted Earnings Per Share (EPS) from Continuing Operations Earnings from continuing operations increased 15% to $48 million and EPS from continuing operations increased 15% to $0.92 in the fourth quarter of 2011. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2011 included the $2.4 million or $0.05 per diluted common share acquisition related restructuring and other charges. Earnings and EPS from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of 2010 included a $8 million or $0.15 per diluted common share benefit related to certain tax benefits partially offset by restructuring and other items. Excluding these items, comparable earnings and EPS from continuing operations increased 48% to $50 million and 49% to $0.97 per diluted common share, respectively. We believe that comparable EBT, comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable EPS from continuing operations measures provide useful information to investors because they exclude significant items that are unrelated to our ongoing business operations. See Note (S), Other Items Impacting Comparability, for information regarding items excluded from the 2011 results. 34 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Net Earnings and EPS Net earnings increased 30% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $48 million or $0.93 per diluted common share. Net earnings in the fourth quarter were impacted by earnings from discontinued operations of $0.4 million in 2011 and losses of $4 million in 2010. The earnings from discontinued operations in 2011 were due to $1 million of favorable insurance reserve developments. FOURTH QUARTER OPERATING RESULTS BY BUSINESS SEGMENT Three months ended December 31, Change 2011 2010 2011/2010 (In thousands) Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $ 1,074,655 948,060 13% Supply Chain Solutions 408,670 325,094 26 Dedicated Contract Carriage 156,627 121,825 29 Eliminations (98,858) (81,553) (21) Total $ 1,541,094 1,313,426 17% Operating Revenue: Fleet Management Solutions $ 813,313 726,254 12% Supply Chain Solutions 324,663 258,309 26 Dedicated Contract Carriage 147,140 119,257 23 Eliminations (48,124) (41,881) (15) Total $ 1,236,992 1,061,939 16% EBT: Fleet Management Solutions $ 69,889 49,498 41% Supply Chain Solutions 17,767 12,327 44 Dedicated Contract Carriage 7,011 6,529 7 Eliminations (7,114) (4,770) (49) 87,553 63,584 38 Unallocated Central Support Services (11,147) (10,825) (3) Restructuring and other charges, net and other items (3,294) (3,151) NM Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes $ 73,112 49,608 47% Fleet Management Solutions Total revenue increased 13% to $1.07 billion in the fourth quarter of 2011. Operating revenue (revenue excluding fuel) increased 12% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $813 million. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year. Three months ended December 31, 2011 Total Operating Acquisitions 6% 7% Organic including price and volume 3 5 FMS fuel 4 Total increase 13% 12% Fuel services revenue increased 18% in the fourth quarter of 2011 due to higher prices passed through to customers. Full service lease revenue increased 5% in the fourth quarter of 2011 from to the impact of recent acquisitions. Commercial rental revenue increased 38% in the fourth quarter of 2011 reflecting improved global market demand and higher pricing. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FMS EBT increased 41% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $70 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, acquisitions and improved used vehicle sales results. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older fleet, investments in sales and marketing initiatives, and higher compensation related expenses. Commercial rental performance improved 54% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 31% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 18%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $7 million primarily due to higher pricing and demand. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 23%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $409 million. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $325 million. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months ended December 31, 2011 Total Operating TLC acquisition 18% 21% Subcontracted transportation 4 Organic including price and volume 5 6 Foreign exchange (1) (1) Total increase 26% 26% SCS EBT increased 44% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $18 million. The TLC acquisition increased SCS EBT by 11% during the fourth quarter of 2011. SCS EBT also benefited from favorable prior year insurance development and new business. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 29% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $157 million. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 23% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $147 million. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months ended December 31, 2011 Total Operating Scully acquisition 21% 17% Organic including price and volume 1 1 Fuel cost pass throughs 5 5 Subcontracted transportation 2 Total increase 29% 23% DCC EBT increased 7% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $7 million reflecting lower insurance costs from favorable development related to prior year claims partially offset by lower operating performance. Central Support Services Total CSS costs increased 8% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $52 million primarily due to higher compensation related expenses, investments in information technology initiatives and increased professional fees. Unallocated CSS costs increased 3% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $11 million primarily due to higher investments in information technology initiatives. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Financing activities 504,202 78,166 (542,016 ) Investing activities (1,657,172 ) (982,464 ) (448,610 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3,219 1,723 1,794 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (107,795 ) 125,459 (3,876 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.04 billion in 2011 compared with $1.03 billion in 2010 because of higher cash based earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital needs. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $504 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 due to higher borrowing needs to fund acquisitions and capital spending. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.66 billion in 2011 compared with $982 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2011. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Sales of revenue earning equipment 290,336 220,843 211,002 Sales of operating property and equipment 9,905 13,844 4,634 Collections on direct finance leases 62,224 61,767 65,242 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 37,395 Other, net 3,178 209 Total cash generated 1,441,816 1,327,666 1,266,043 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,698,589 ) (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) Free cash flow $ (256,773 ) 257,574 614,090 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Free cash flow decreased to negative $257 million in 2011 compared with positive $258 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2012 to be approximately $430 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line as well as the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 1,067,025 646,671 547,750 Commercial rental 622,181 378,678 7,436 1,689,206 1,025,349 555,186 Operating property and equipment 70,673 62,302 56,216 Total capital expenditures (1) 1,759,879 1,087,651 611,402 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (61,290 ) (17,559 ) 40,551 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,698,589 1,070,092 651,953 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions in 2011 of $37 million in assets held under capital leases resulting from a sale leaseback transaction. Non cash additions also exclude approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 because of higher full service lease vehicle spending for new business and replacements of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the rental fleet. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $2.15 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional debt financing. Working Capital 2011 2010 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,088,173 $ 1,023,301 Current liabilities 1,173,823 1,131,519 Working capital $ (85,650 ) $ (108,218 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(86) million at December 31, 2011 compared with $(108) million at December 31, 2010. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a net decrease of $146 million in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and cash. Excluding the decrease in short term debt, other working capital components decreased $123 million primarily due to a lower cash balance as of the end of 2011. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Net Earnings and EPS Net earnings increased 30% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $48 million or $0.93 per diluted common share. Net earnings in the fourth quarter were impacted by earnings from discontinued operations of $0.4 million in 2011 and losses of $4 million in 2010. The earnings from discontinued operations in 2011 were due to $1 million of favorable insurance reserve developments.

Full service lease revenue increased 5% in the fourth quarter of 2011 from to the impact of recent acquisitions. Commercial rental revenue increased 38% in the fourth quarter of 2011 reflecting improved global market demand and higher pricing. 35 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FMS EBT increased 41% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $70 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, acquisitions and improved used vehicle sales results. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older fleet, investments in sales and marketing initiatives, and higher compensation related expenses. Commercial rental performance improved 54% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 31% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 18%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $7 million primarily due to higher pricing and demand. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 23%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $409 million. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $325 million. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months ended December 31, 2011 Total Operating TLC acquisition 18% 21% Subcontracted transportation 4 Organic including price and volume 5 6 Foreign exchange (1) (1) Total increase 26% 26% SCS EBT increased 44% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $18 million. The TLC acquisition increased SCS EBT by 11% during the fourth quarter of 2011. SCS EBT also benefited from favorable prior year insurance development and new business. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 29% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $157 million. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 23% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $147 million.

Central Support Services Total CSS costs increased 8% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $52 million primarily due to higher compensation related expenses, investments in information technology initiatives and increased professional fees. Unallocated CSS costs increased 3% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $11 million primarily due to higher investments in information technology initiatives. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Financing activities 504,202 78,166 (542,016 ) Investing activities (1,657,172 ) (982,464 ) (448,610 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3,219 1,723 1,794 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (107,795 ) 125,459 (3,876 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.04 billion in 2011 compared with $1.03 billion in 2010 because of higher cash based earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital needs. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $504 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 due to higher borrowing needs to fund acquisitions and capital spending. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.66 billion in 2011 compared with $982 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2011. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Sales of revenue earning equipment 290,336 220,843 211,002 Sales of operating property and equipment 9,905 13,844 4,634 Collections on direct finance leases 62,224 61,767 65,242 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 37,395 Other, net 3,178 209 Total cash generated 1,441,816 1,327,666 1,266,043 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,698,589 ) (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) Free cash flow $ (256,773 ) 257,574 614,090 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Free cash flow decreased to negative $257 million in 2011 compared with positive $258 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2012 to be approximately $430 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line as well as the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 1,067,025 646,671 547,750 Commercial rental 622,181 378,678 7,436 1,689,206 1,025,349 555,186 Operating property and equipment 70,673 62,302 56,216 Total capital expenditures (1) 1,759,879 1,087,651 611,402 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (61,290 ) (17,559 ) 40,551 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,698,589 1,070,092 651,953 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions in 2011 of $37 million in assets held under capital leases resulting from a sale leaseback transaction. Non cash additions also exclude approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 because of higher full service lease vehicle spending for new business and replacements of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the rental fleet. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $2.15 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional debt financing. Working Capital 2011 2010 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,088,173 $ 1,023,301 Current liabilities 1,173,823 1,131,519 Working capital $ (85,650 ) $ (108,218 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(86) million at December 31, 2011 compared with $(108) million at December 31, 2010. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a net decrease of $146 million in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and cash. Excluding the decrease in short term debt, other working capital components decreased $123 million primarily due to a lower cash balance as of the end of 2011. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below.

Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FMS EBT increased 41% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $70 million primarily due to significantly better commercial rental performance, acquisitions and improved used vehicle sales results. The increase in EBT was partially offset by higher maintenance costs on an older fleet, investments in sales and marketing initiatives, and higher compensation related expenses. Commercial rental performance improved 54% as a result of increased market demand and higher pricing on a 31% larger average fleet. The increase in the average fleet reflects organic growth of 13% and an acquisition related impact of 18%. Used vehicle sales results improved by $7 million primarily due to higher pricing and demand. Acquisitions increased FMS EBT by 23%. Supply Chain Solutions Total revenue increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $409 million. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 26% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $325 million. The following table summarizes the components of the change in revenue on a percentage basis versus the prior year: Three months ended December 31, 2011 Total Operating TLC acquisition 18% 21% Subcontracted transportation 4 Organic including price and volume 5 6 Foreign exchange (1) (1) Total increase 26% 26% SCS EBT increased 44% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $18 million. The TLC acquisition increased SCS EBT by 11% during the fourth quarter of 2011. SCS EBT also benefited from favorable prior year insurance development and new business. Dedicated Contract Carriage Total revenue increased 29% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $157 million. Operating revenue (revenue excluding subcontracted transportation) increased 23% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $147 million.

Central Support Services Total CSS costs increased 8% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $52 million primarily due to higher compensation related expenses, investments in information technology initiatives and increased professional fees. Unallocated CSS costs increased 3% in the fourth quarter of 2011 to $11 million primarily due to higher investments in information technology initiatives. 36 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Financing activities 504,202 78,166 (542,016 ) Investing activities (1,657,172 ) (982,464 ) (448,610 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3,219 1,723 1,794 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (107,795 ) 125,459 (3,876 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.04 billion in 2011 compared with $1.03 billion in 2010 because of higher cash based earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital needs. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $504 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 due to higher borrowing needs to fund acquisitions and capital spending. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.66 billion in 2011 compared with $982 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2011. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Sales of revenue earning equipment 290,336 220,843 211,002 Sales of operating property and equipment 9,905 13,844 4,634 Collections on direct finance leases 62,224 61,767 65,242 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 37,395 Other, net 3,178 209 Total cash generated 1,441,816 1,327,666 1,266,043 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,698,589 ) (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) Free cash flow $ (256,773 ) 257,574 614,090 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Free cash flow decreased to negative $257 million in 2011 compared with positive $258 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2012 to be approximately $430 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line as well as the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 1,067,025 646,671 547,750 Commercial rental 622,181 378,678 7,436 1,689,206 1,025,349 555,186 Operating property and equipment 70,673 62,302 56,216 Total capital expenditures (1) 1,759,879 1,087,651 611,402 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (61,290 ) (17,559 ) 40,551 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,698,589 1,070,092 651,953 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions in 2011 of $37 million in assets held under capital leases resulting from a sale leaseback transaction. Non cash additions also exclude approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 because of higher full service lease vehicle spending for new business and replacements of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the rental fleet. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $2.15 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional debt financing. Working Capital 2011 2010 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,088,173 $ 1,023,301 Current liabilities 1,173,823 1,131,519 Working capital $ (85,650 ) $ (108,218 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(86) million at December 31, 2011 compared with $(108) million at December 31, 2010. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a net decrease of $146 million in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and cash. Excluding the decrease in short term debt, other working capital components decreased $123 million primarily due to a lower cash balance as of the end of 2011. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below.

Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND LIQUIDITY Cash Flows The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, financing and investing activities from continuing operations: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by (used in): Operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Financing activities 504,202 78,166 (542,016 ) Investing activities (1,657,172 ) (982,464 ) (448,610 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 3,219 1,723 1,794 Net change in cash and cash equivalents $ (107,795 ) 125,459 (3,876 ) Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.04 billion in 2011 compared with $1.03 billion in 2010 because of higher cash based earnings partially offset by an increase in working capital needs. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $504 million in 2011 from $78 million in 2010 due to higher borrowing needs to fund acquisitions and capital spending. Cash used in investing activities increased to $1.66 billion in 2011 compared with $982 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2011. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations increased to $1.03 billion in 2010 compared with $985 million in 2009 because of reduced working capital needs primarily from lower pension contributions and compensation related payments, partially offset by lower cash based earnings. Cash provided by financing activities increased to $78 million in 2010 from cash used in financing activities of $542 million in 2009 reflecting higher borrowing needs to fund capital spending, including acquisitions. Cash used in investing activities increased to $982 million in 2010 compared with $449 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and acquisition related payments in 2010. Our principal sources of operating liquidity are cash from operations and proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. We refer to the sum of operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of revenue earning equipment and operating property and equipment, collections on direct finance leases, sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment and other cash inflows as total cash generated. We refer to the net amount of cash generated from operating and investing activities (excluding changes in restricted cash and acquisitions) as free cash flow. Although total cash generated and free cash flow are non GAAP financial measures, we consider them to be important measures of comparative operating performance. We also believe total cash generated to be an important measure of total cash inflows generated from our ongoing business activities. We believe free cash flow provides investors with an important perspective on the cash available for debt service, acquisitions and for shareholders after making capital investments required to support ongoing business operations. Our calculation of free cash flow may be different from the calculation used by other companies and therefore comparability may be limited. The following table shows the sources of our free cash flow computation: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,041,956 1,028,034 984,956 Sales of revenue earning equipment 290,336 220,843 211,002 Sales of operating property and equipment 9,905 13,844 4,634 Collections on direct finance leases 62,224 61,767 65,242 Sale and leaseback of revenue earning equipment 37,395 Other, net 3,178 209 Total cash generated 1,441,816 1,327,666 1,266,043 Purchases of property and revenue earning equipment (1,698,589 ) (1,070,092 ) (651,953 ) Free cash flow $ (256,773 ) 257,574 614,090 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Free cash flow decreased to negative $257 million in 2011 compared with positive $258 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2012 to be approximately $430 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line as well as the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 1,067,025 646,671 547,750 Commercial rental 622,181 378,678 7,436 1,689,206 1,025,349 555,186 Operating property and equipment 70,673 62,302 56,216 Total capital expenditures (1) 1,759,879 1,087,651 611,402 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (61,290 ) (17,559 ) 40,551 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,698,589 1,070,092 651,953 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions in 2011 of $37 million in assets held under capital leases resulting from a sale leaseback transaction. Non cash additions also exclude approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 because of higher full service lease vehicle spending for new business and replacements of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the rental fleet. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $2.15 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional debt financing. Working Capital 2011 2010 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,088,173 $ 1,023,301 Current liabilities 1,173,823 1,131,519 Working capital $ (85,650 ) $ (108,218 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(86) million at December 31, 2011 compared with $(108) million at December 31, 2010. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a net decrease of $146 million in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and cash. Excluding the decrease in short term debt, other working capital components decreased $123 million primarily due to a lower cash balance as of the end of 2011. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Free cash flow decreased to negative $257 million in 2011 compared with positive $258 million in 2010 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending partially offset by higher proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment. Free cash flow decreased to $258 million in 2010 compared with $614 million in 2009 primarily due to higher vehicle capital spending and lower cash based earnings partially offset by lower pension contributions. We expect negative free cash flow in 2012 to be approximately $430 million reflecting higher capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally used to purchase revenue earning equipment (trucks, tractors and trailers) within our FMS segment. These expenditures primarily support the full service lease product line as well as the commercial rental product line. The level of capital required to support the full service lease product line varies directly with the customer contract signings for replacement vehicles and growth. These contracts are long term agreements that result in predictable cash flows typically over a three to seven year term for trucks and tractors and ten years for trailers. The commercial rental product line utilizes capital for the purchase of vehicles to replenish and expand the fleet available for shorter term use by contractual or occasional customers. Operating property and equipment expenditures primarily relate to FMS and SCS spending on items such as vehicle maintenance facilities and equipment, computer and telecommunications equipment, investments in technologies, and warehouse facilities and equipment. The following is a summary of capital expenditures: 2011 2010 2009 (In thousands) Revenue earning equipment: Full service lease $ 1,067,025 646,671 547,750 Commercial rental 622,181 378,678 7,436 1,689,206 1,025,349 555,186 Operating property and equipment 70,673 62,302 56,216 Total capital expenditures (1) 1,759,879 1,087,651 611,402 Changes in accounts payable related to purchases of revenue earning equipment (61,290 ) (17,559 ) 40,551 Cash paid for purchases of property and revenue earning equipment $ 1,698,589 1,070,092 651,953 (1) Capital expenditures exclude non cash additions in 2011 of $37 million in assets held under capital leases resulting from a sale leaseback transaction. Non cash additions also exclude approximately $2 million, $2 million and $1 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in assets held under capital leases resulting from the extension of existing operating leases and other additions. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 62% to $1.76 billion in 2011 because of higher full service lease vehicle spending for new business and replacements of customer fleets and increased commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the rental fleet. Capital expenditures (accrual basis) increased 78% to $1.09 billion in 2010 primarily as a result of a planned increase in commercial rental spending to refresh and grow the fleet. We expect capital expenditures to increase to $2.15 billion, as we make investments in both the lease and rental fleet. We expect to fund 2012 capital expenditures with both internally generated funds and additional debt financing. Working Capital 2011 2010 (In thousands) Current assets $ 1,088,173 $ 1,023,301 Current liabilities 1,173,823 1,131,519 Working capital $ (85,650 ) $ (108,218 ) Our net working capital (current assets less current liabilities) was $(86) million at December 31, 2011 compared with $(108) million at December 31, 2010. The increase in net working capital was primarily due to a net decrease of $146 million in short term debt and the current portion of long term debt and cash. Excluding the decrease in short term debt, other working capital components decreased $123 million primarily due to a lower cash balance as of the end of 2011. Financing and Other Funding Transactions We utilize external capital primarily to support working capital needs and growth in our asset based product lines. The variety of financing alternatives typically available to fund our capital needs include commercial paper, long term and medium term public and private debt, asset backed securities, bank term loans, leasing arrangements and bank credit facilities. Our principal sources of financing are issuances of commercial paper and medium term notes. 38 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. Refer to Note 15, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our sale leaseback transactions.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Our ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both our short term and long term debt ratings. These ratings are intended to provide guidance to fixed income investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular Ryder securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from us or from other sources. Lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to unsecured capital markets. A downgrade of our short term debt ratings to a lower tier would impair our ability to issue commercial paper. As a result, we would have to rely on alternative funding sources. A downgrade of our debt ratings would not affect our ability to borrow amounts under our revolving credit facility described below, given ongoing compliance with the terms and conditions of the credit facility. Our debt ratings at December 31, 2011 were as follows: Short term Long term Outlook Moodys Investors Service P2 Baa1 Stable (affirmed February 2011) Standard & Poors Ratings Services A2 BBB+ Stable (affirmed August 2011) Fitch Ratings F2 A Stable (affirmed March 2011) We believe that our operating cash flows, together with our access to commercial paper markets and other available debt financing, will be adequate to meet our operating, investing and financing needs in the foreseeable future. However, there can be no assurance that unanticipated volatility and disruption in commercial paper markets would not impair our ability to access these markets on terms commercially acceptable to us or at all. If we cease to have access to commercial paper and other sources of unsecured borrowings, we would meet our liquidity needs by drawing upon contractually committed lending agreements as described below and or by seeking other funding sources. At December 31, 2011, we had the following amounts available to fund operations under the following facilities: (In millions) Global revolving credit facility $ 483 Trade receivables program 175 We have a $900 million global revolving credit facility with a syndicate of twelve lending institutions which matures in June 2016 and is used primarily to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of unsecured commercial paper in the U.S. and Canada. In order to maintain availability of funding, we must maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth, of less than or equal to 300%. Tangible net worth, as defined in the credit facility, includes 50% of our deferred federal income tax liability and excludes the book value of our intangibles. The ratio at December 31, 2011 was 255%. We also have a $175 million trade receivables purchase and sale program, pursuant to which we ultimately sell certain ownership interests in certain of our domestic trade accounts receivable to a receivables conduit or committed purchasers. We use this program to provide additional liquidity to fund our operations, particularly when it is cost effective to do so. The program expires on October 26, 2012. The program contains provisions restricting its availability in the event of a material adverse change to our business operations or the collectibility of the collateralized receivables. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion around the global revolving credit facility and the trade receivables program. On February 25, 2010, Ryder filed an automatic shelf registration statement on Form S 3 with the SEC. The registration is for an indeterminate number of securities and is effective for three years. Under this universal shelf registration statement, we have the capacity to offer and sell from time to time various types of securities, including common stock, preferred stock and debt securities, subject to market demand and ratings status. Refer to Note 16, Debt, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion around the issuance of medium term notes under this shelf registration statement and debt maturities. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Sale and leaseback transactions. Refer to Note 15, Leases, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our sale leaseback transactions. Guarantees. Refer to Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our agreements involving guarantees. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) The following table shows the movements in our debt balance: 2011 2010 (In thousands) Debt balance at January 1 $ 2,747,002 2,497,691 Cash related changes in debt: Net change in commercial paper borrowings 46,749 174,939 Proceeds from issuance of medium term notes 699,244 300,000 Proceeds from issuance of other debt instruments 267,158 14,169 Retirement of medium term notes and debentures (375,000 ) (175,000 ) Other debt repaid, including capital lease obligations (44,287 ) (73,668 ) Net change from discontinued operations (140 ) (2,955 ) 593,724 237,485 Non cash changes in debt: Fair market value adjustment on notes subject to hedging 6,414 3,328 Addition of capital lease obligations 39,279 2,164 Changes in foreign currency exchange rates and other non cash items (4,274 ) 6,334 Total changes in debt 635,143 249,311 Debt balance at December 31 $ 3,382,145 2,747,002 In accordance with our funding philosophy, we attempt to match the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our debt with the aggregate average remaining re pricing life of our assets. We utilize both fixed rate and variable rate debt to achieve this match and generally target a mix of 25% 45% variable rate debt as a percentage of total debt outstanding. The variable rate portion of our total obligations (including notional value of swap agreements) was 40% and 28% at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Ryders leverage ratios and a reconciliation of on balance sheet debt to total obligations were as follows: 2011 %of Equity 2010 %of Equity (Dollars in thousands) On balance sheet debt $ 3,382,145 257% $ 2,747,002 196% Off balance sheet debt PV of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles (1) 63,960 99,797 Total obligations $ 3,446,105 261% $ 2,846,799 203% (1) Present value (PV) does not reflect payments we would be required to make if we terminated the related leases prior to the scheduled expiration dates. On balance sheet debt to equity consists of balance sheet debt divided by total equity. Total obligations to equity represents balance sheet debt plus the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for vehicles, discounted based on our incremental borrowing rate at lease inception, all divided by total equity. Although total obligations is a non GAAP financial measure, we believe that total obligations is useful as it provides a more complete analysis of our existing financial obligations and helps better assess our overall leverage position. The increase in our leverage ratios in 2011 was due to acquisitions and increased investments in vehicles as well as a pension equity charge.

Guarantees. Refer to Note 19, Guarantees, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our agreements involving guarantees. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions.

NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Contractual Obligations and Commitments As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into arrangements that obligate us to make future payments under contracts such as debt agreements, lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations. The following table summarizes our expected future contractual cash obligations and commitments at December 31, 2011: 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (In thousands) Debt $ 267,496 685,346 1,846,057 513,356 3,312,255 Capital lease obligations 6,870 12,721 11,291 17,165 48,047 Total debt, including capital leases (1) 274,366 698,067 1,857,348 530,521 3,360,302 Interest on debt (2) 128,370 199,853 115,402 102,659 546,284 Operating leases (3) 96,623 141,651 44,081 30,797 313,152 Purchase obligations (4) 652,818 19,171 12,839 2,683 687,511 Total contractual cash obligations 877,811 360,675 172,322 136,139 1,546,947 Insurance obligations (primarily self insurance) 120,045 93,091 36,183 28,116 277,435 Other long term liabilities (5), (6), (7) 2,296 2,881 2,548 46,287 54,012 Total $ 1,274,518 1,154,714 2,068,401 741,063 5,238,696 (1) Net of unamortized discount. (2) Total debt matures at various dates through fiscal year 2025 and bears interest principally at fixed rates. Interest on variable rate debt is calculated based on the applicable rate at December 31, 2011. Amounts are based on existing debt obligations, including capital leases, and do not consider potential refinancing of expiring debt obligations. (3) Represents future lease payments associated with vehicles, equipment and properties under operating leases. Amounts are based upon the general assumption that the leased asset will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements. No effect has been given to renewals, cancellations, contingent rentals or future rate changes. (4) The majority of our purchase obligations are pay as you go transactions made in the ordinary course of business. Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including: fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. The most significant item included in the above table are purchase obligations related to vehicles. Purchase orders made in the ordinary course of business that are cancelable are excluded from the above table. Any amounts for which we are liable under purchase orders for goods received are reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as Accounts payable and Accrued expenses and other current liabilities and are excluded from the above table. (5) Represents other long term liability amounts reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets that have known payment streams. The most significant items included were asset retirement obligations and deferred compensation obligations. (6) The amounts exclude our estimated pension contributions. For 2012, our pension contributions, including our minimum funding requirements as set forth by ERISA and international regulatory bodies, are expected to be $81 million. Our minimum funding requirements after 2012 are dependent on several factors. However, we estimate that the undiscounted required global contributions over the next five years are approximately $544 million (pre tax) (assuming expected long term rate of return realized and other assumptions remain unchanged). We also have payments due under our other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans. These plans are not required to be funded in advance, but are pay as you go. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. (7) The amounts exclude $69 million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. 41 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Pension Information Over the past few years we have made the following amendments to our defined benefit retirement plans: In July 2009, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze our United Kingdom (U.K.) retirement plan for all participants effective March 31, 2010. In July 2008, our Board of Directors approved an amendment to freeze the defined benefit portion of our Canadian retirement plan effective January 1, 2010 for current participants who do not meet certain grandfathering criteria. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved the amendment to freeze the U.S. pension plans effective December 31, 2007 for current participants who did not meet certain grandfathering criteria. As a result of these amendments, non grandfathered plan participants ceased accruing benefits under the plan as of the respective amendment effective date and began receiving an enhanced benefit under a defined contribution plan. All retirement benefits earned as of the amendment effective date were fully preserved and will be paid in accordance with the plan and legal requirements. There was no material impact to our financial condition and operating results from the plan amendments in 2009, 2010 or 2011. Due to the underfunded status of our defined benefit plans, we had an accumulated net pension equity charge (after tax) of $595 million and $423 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The higher equity charge in 2011 reflects the impact of a lower discount rate and lower actual returns compared to the expected asset returns during 2011. The total asset return for our U.S. qualified pension plan (our primary plan) was negative 0.5% in 2011. The funded status of our pension plans is dependent upon many factors, including returns on invested assets and the level of certain market interest rates. We review pension assumptions regularly and we may from time to time make voluntary contributions to our pension plans, which exceed the amounts required by statute. During 2011, total pension contributions, including our international plans, were $65 million compared with $64 million in 2010. We estimate 2012 required pension contributions will be $81 million. After considering the 2011 contributions and asset performance, the projected present value of estimated global pension contributions that would be required over the next 5 years totals approximately $496 million (pre tax). Changes in interest rates and the market value of the securities held by the plans could materially change, positively or negatively, the funded status of the plans and affect the level of pension expense and required contributions in future years. The ultimate amount of contributions is also dependent upon the requirements of applicable laws and regulations. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. Pension expense totaled $34 million in 2011 compared to $42 million in 2010. The decrease in pension expense reflects reduced amortization of actuarial losses attributed to higher than expected return on pension assets in 2010 and the favorable impact from pension contributions made in the fourth quarter of 2010. We expect 2012 pension expense to increase approximately $15 million primarily because of increased amortization of actuarial losses attributed to lower than expected actual return on plan assets in 2011 as well as a reduction in our expected return on plan assets. Our 2012 pension expense estimates are subject to change based upon the completion of the actuarial analysis for all pension plans. See the section titled Critical Accounting Estimates Pension Plans for further discussion on pension accounting estimates. We participate in eleven U.S. multi employer pension (MEP) plans that provide defined benefits to employees covered by collective bargaining agreements. At December 31, 2011, approximately 890 employees (approximately 3% of total employees) participated in these MEP plans. The annual net pension cost of the MEP plans is equal to the annual contribution determined in accordance with the provisions of negotiated labor contracts. Our current annualized MEP plan contributions total approximately $6 million. Pursuant to current U.S. pension laws, if any MEP plans fail to meet certain minimum funding thresholds, we could be required to make additional MEP plan contributions, until the respective labor agreement expires, of up to 10% of current contractual requirements. Several factors could cause MEP plans not to meet these minimum funding thresholds, including unfavorable investment performance, changes in participant demographics, and increased benefits to participants. The plan administrators and trustees of the MEP plans provide us with the annual funding notice as required by law. This notice sets forth the funded status of the plan as of the beginning of the prior year but does not provide any company specific information. Employers participating in MEP plans can elect to withdraw from the plans, contingent upon labor union consent, and be subject to a withdrawal obligation based on, among other factors, the MEP plans unfunded vested benefits. U.S. pension regulations provide that an employer can fund its withdrawal obligation in a lump sum or over a time period of up to 20 years based on previous contribution rates. Based on the most recently available plan information, obtained in 2011, we estimate our pre tax contingent MEP plan withdrawal obligation to be approximately $27 million. We have no current intention of taking any action that would subject us to the payment of material withdrawal obligations; however, under applicable law, in very limited circumstances, the plan trustee can impose these obligations on us. See Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information. 42 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by ITEM 7A is included in ITEM 7 (page 43) of PART II of this report. 51 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Share Repurchase Programs and Cash Dividends Refer to Note 20, Share Repurchase Programs, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion on our share repurchase programs. Cash dividend payments to shareholders of common stock were $58 million in 2011, $54 million in 2010, and $53 million in 2009. During 2011, we increased our annual dividend to $1.16 per share of common stock. Market Risk In the normal course of business, we are exposed to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fuel prices. We manage these exposures in several ways, including, in certain circumstances, the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent. We do not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates exists for our debt obligations. Our interest rate risk management program objectives are to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk primarily through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt we hold in the total debt portfolio. From time to time, we also use interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage our fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of debt instruments to that of our portfolio of assets. See Note 18, Derivatives, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion on interest rate swap agreements. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.98 billion of fixed rate debt outstanding (excluding capital leases) with a weighted average interest rate of 5.2% and a fair value of $2.15 billion. A hypothetical 10% decrease or increase in the December 31, 2011 market interest rates would impact the fair value of our fixed rate debt by approximately $25 million at December 31, 2011. Changes in the relative sensitivity of the fair value of our financial instrument portfolio for these theoretical changes in the level of interest rates are primarily driven by changes in our debt maturities, interest rate profile and amount. At December 31, 2011, we had $1.36 billion of variable rate debt, including the impact of interest rate swaps, which effectively changed $550 million of fixed rate debt instruments to LIBOR based floating rate debt. Changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps were offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss was recognized in earnings. The fair value of our interest rate swap agreements at December 31, 2011 was recorded as an asset totaling $22 million. The fair value of our variable rate debt at December 31, 2011 was $1.36 billion. A hypothetical 10% increase in market interest rates would have impacted 2011 pre tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $2 million. We also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized each period. Exposure to market risk for changes in foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries. The majority of our transactions are denominated in U.S. dollars. The principal foreign currency exchange rate risks to which we are exposed include the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling and Mexican peso. We manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related to our foreign operations buying, selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies to the extent possible. A hypothetical uniform 10% strengthening in the value of the dollar relative to all the currencies in which our transactions are denominated would result in a decrease to pre tax earnings from continuing operations of approximately $5 million. We also use foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure. We generally do not hedge the translation exposure related to our net investment in foreign subsidiaries, since we generally have no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries. Exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a small portion of our service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices. At December 31, 2011, we also had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) shortages. We are exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices in these arrangements since none of the arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased. Increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to our customers for which we realize minimal changes in profitability during periods of steady market fuel prices. However, profitability may be positively or negatively impacted by sudden increases or decreases in market fuel prices during a short period of time as customer pricing for fuel services is established based on market fuel costs. We believe the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact our results of operations, cash flows or financial position. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Refer to Note 25, Environmental Matters, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion surrounding environmental matters. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions. Our significant accounting policies are described in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of these policies require the application of subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. These estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience, changes in the business environment and other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances. Different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely can result in a material impact on our financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods. We review the development, selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with Ryders Audit Committee on an annual basis. The following discussion, which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that we consider to be critical. Depreciation and Residual Value Guarantees. We periodically review and adjust the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of our FMS business segment as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Revenue Earning Equipment, Operating Property and Equipment, and Depreciation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Residual Value Guarantees and Deferred Gains, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Reductions in residual values (i.e., the price at which we ultimately expect to dispose of revenue earning equipment) or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment. Based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in 2012 by approximately $116 million. We review residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of our revenue earning equipment. Reviews are performed based on vehicle class, generally subcategories of trucks, tractors and trailers by weight and usage. Our annual review is established with a long term view considering historical market price changes, current and expected future market price trends, expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles (e.g., rental fleet, and SCS and DCC applications). As a result, future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors. While we believe that the carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future sales proceeds will not occur, resulting in lower gains or losses on sales. At the end of each year, we complete our annual review of the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment. Based on the results of our analysis in 2011, we will adjust the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2012. The change will increase earnings in 2012 by approximately $18 million compared with 2011. Factors that could cause actual results to materially differ from the estimated results include significant changes in the used equipment market brought on by unforeseen changes in technology innovations and any resulting changes in the useful lives of used equipment. Based on the results of the 2010 review, we adjusted the residual values and useful lives of certain classes of revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2011. The residual value changes increased pre tax earnings for 2011 by approximately $5 million compared with 2010. Based on the results of our 2009 analysis, we adjusted the residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010. The residual value changes decreased pre tax earnings for 2010 by approximately $14 million compared with 2009. Depreciation expense was $872 million, $834 million and $881 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and has been recorded within Cost of lease and rental, Cost of services, Cost of fuel services and Other operating expenses depending on the nature of the related asset. Depreciation expense relates primarily to FMS revenue earning equipment. Depreciation expense increased 5% in 2011 driven by $41 million from acquisitions, foreign exchange movements of $7 million and higher average net 44 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) vehicle investments. The increase was partially offset by $15 million of lower write downs of vehicles held for sale and $10 million from both changes in residual values and accelerated depreciation. Depreciation expense decreased 5% in 2010 because of a smaller fleet as well as decreased write downs of $26 million. The decrease in depreciation expense was partially offset by higher average vehicle investments as well as changes in both residual values of certain classes of our revenue earning equipment effective January 1, 2010 and accelerated depreciation for select vehicles expected to be sold by 2011. We also lease vehicles under operating lease agreements. Certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment. Results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease. The amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease. At December 31, 2011, total liabilities for residual value guarantees of $4 million were included in Accrued expenses and other current liabilities (for those payable in less than one year) and in Other non current liabilities. Based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at December 31, 2011, a 10% decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in 2012 by approximately $2 million. Pension Plans. We apply actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis, or on an interim basis if there is an event requiring remeasurement. Each December, we review actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and make adjustments to our assumptions, if warranted. In determining our annual estimate of periodic pension cost, we are required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate, expected long term rate of return, expected increase in compensation levels, retirement rate and mortality. Discount rates are based upon a duration analysis of expected benefit payments and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments as of our December 31 annual measurement date. In order to provide a more accurate estimate of the discount rate relevant to our plan, we use models that match projected benefits payments of our primary U.S. plan to coupons and maturities from a hypothetical portfolio of high quality corporate bonds. Long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of our asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns. Investment management and other fees paid using plan assets are factored into the determination of asset return assumptions. In 2011, we adjusted our long term expected rate of return assumption for our primary U.S. plan down to 7.45% from 7.65% based on the factors reviewed. The composition of our pension assets was 64% equity securities and 36% debt securities and other investments. As part of our strategy to manage future pension costs and net funded status volatility, we regularly assess our pension investment strategy. We evaluate our mix of investments between equity and fixed income securities and may adjust the composition of our pension assets when appropriate. For 2012, our target asset allocation is 60% equity securities, 30% fixed income, and 10% all other types of investments. The rate of increase in compensation levels and retirement rates are based primarily on actual experience. Accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between these assumptions and actual experience or the revision of an estimate. This approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted and recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss. We had a pre tax actuarial loss of $927 million at the end of 2011 compared with a loss of $658 million at the end of 2010. The increase in the net actuarial loss in 2011 resulted primarily from a lower discount rate and lower than expected pension asset returns. To the extent the amount of actuarial gains and losses exceed 10% of the larger of the benefit obligation or plan assets, such amount is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of active participants or the remaining life expectancy of inactive participants if all or almost all of a plans participants are inactive. The amount of the actuarial loss subject to amortization in 2012 and future years will be $730 million. We expect to recognize approximately $31 million of the net actuarial loss as a component of pension expense in 2012. The effect on years beyond 2012 will depend substantially upon the actual experience of our plans. Disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the 2011 net pension expense is presented in Note 24, Employee Benefit Plans, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. A sensitivity analysis of 2011 net pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for our primary plan, the U.S. pension plan, is presented below. Assumed Rate Change Impact on 2011 NetPension Expense Effect on December 31, 2011Projected Benefit Obligation Expected long term rate of return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $2.7 million Discount rate increase 5.70 % + 0.25 % $0.8 million $44 million Discount rate decrease 5.70 % 0.25 % + $0.5 million + $44 million Actual return on assets 7.45 % +/ 0.25 % /+ $0.3 million Self Insurance Accruals. Self insurance accruals were $253 million and $243 million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The majority of our self insurance relates to vehicle liability and workers compensation. We use a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported. In applying these methods and assessing their results, we consider such 45 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) factors as frequency and severity of claims, claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of our business, among other factors. Such factors are analyzed for each of our business segments. Our estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services, unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process. During 2011, 2010, and 2009, we recorded a benefit (charge) within earnings from continuing operations of $4 million, $(3) million, and $1 million, respectively, from development in estimated prior years self insured loss reserves. Based on self insurance accruals at December 31, 2011, a 5% adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in 2012 by approximately $11 million. Goodwill Impairment. We assess goodwill for impairment, as described in Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary. At December 31, 2011, goodwill totaled $377 million. To determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist, we are required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value. A reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance. Our valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on an average of discounted future cash flow models that use ten years of projected cash flows and various terminal values based on multiples, book value or growth assumptions. We considered the current trading multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and the historical pricing multiples for comparable merger and acquisition transactions that have occurred in our industry. Rates used to discount cash flows are dependent upon interest rates and the cost of capital at a point in time. Our discount rates reflect a weighted average cost of capital based on our industry and capital structure adjusted for equity risk premiums and size risk premiums based on market capitalization. Estimates of future cash flows are dependent on our knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions we expect to exist, including long term growth rates, capital requirements and useful lives. Our estimates of cash flows are also based on historical and future operating performance, economic conditions and actions we expect to take. In addition to these factors, our SCS reporting units are dependent on several key customers or industry sectors. The loss of a key customer may have a significant impact to one of our SCS reporting units, causing us to assess whether or not the event resulted in a goodwill impairment loss. While we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable, there can be no assurance that deterioration in economic conditions, customer relationships or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur, resulting in a goodwill impairment loss. Our annual impairment test performed as of April 1, 2011 did not result in any impairment of goodwill. The excess of fair value over carrying value for each of our reporting units as of April 1, 2011, our annual testing date, ranged from approximately $13 million to approximately $361 million. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, we applied a hypothetical 5% decrease to the fair values of each reporting unit. This hypothetical 5% decrease would result in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately $9 million to approximately $204 million for each of our reporting units. Revenue Recognition. We recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the services have been rendered to customers or delivery has occurred, the pricing is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. In the normal course of business, we may act as or use an agent in executing transactions with our customers. In these arrangements, we evaluate whether we should report revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or on the net amount received from the customer after payments to third parties. Determining whether revenue should be reported as gross or net is based on an assessment of whether we are acting as the principal or the agent in the transaction and involves judgment based on the terms of the arrangement. To the extent we are acting as the principal in the transaction, revenue is reported on a gross basis. To the extent we are acting as an agent in the transaction, revenue is reported on a net basis. In the majority of our arrangements, we are acting as a principal and therefore report revenue on a gross basis. However, our SCS business segment engages in some transactions where we act as agents and thus record revenue on a net basis. The impact on net earnings is the same whether we record revenue on a gross or net basis. From time to time, the terms and conditions of our transportation management arrangements may change, which could require a change in revenue recognition from a gross basis to a net basis or vice versa. Our non GAAP measure of operating revenue would not be impacted from this change in revenue reporting. Income Taxes. Our overall tax position is complex and requires careful analysis by management to estimate the expected realization of income tax assets and liabilities. 46 Table of Contents ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions.

You should not place undue reliance on the forward looking statements contained herein, which speak only as of the date of this Annual Report. We do not intend, or assume any obligation, to update or revise any forward looking statements contained in this Annual Report, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The information required by ITEM 7A is included in ITEM 7 (page 43) of PART II of this report. 51 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Continued) Tax regulations require items to be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. As a result, the effective tax rate reflected in the financial statements is different than that reported in the tax return. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible on the tax return, and some are timing differences, such as depreciation expense. Timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets amounted to $626 million and $365 million at December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. We record a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, the deferred tax valuation allowance, principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the SCS business segment, was $41 million and $39 million, respectively. In determining the required level of valuation allowance, we consider whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. This assessment is based on managements expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods. Our assessment involves estimates and assumptions about matters that are inherently uncertain, and unanticipated events or circumstances could cause actual results to differ from these estimates. Should we change our estimate of the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to the provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made. We are subject to tax audits in numerous jurisdictions in the U.S. and around the world. Tax audits by their very nature are often complex and can require several years to complete. In the normal course of business, we are subject to challenges from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and other tax authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. These challenges may alter the timing or amount of taxable income or deductions, or the allocation of income among tax jurisdictions. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes on earnings, we determine whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not of being sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is more likely than not of being sustained in our consolidated financial statements. Such accruals require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit. Actual results could vary materially from these estimates. We adjust these reserves, including any impact on the related interest and penalties, in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as progress of a tax audit. A number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a reserve is audited and finally resolved. The number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction. The tax benefit that has been previously reserved because of a failure to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold would be recognized in our income tax expense in the first interim period when the uncertainty is resolved under any one of the following conditions: (1) the tax position is more likely than not to be sustained, (2) the tax position, amount, and or timing is ultimately settled through negotiation or litigation, or (3) the statute of limitations for the tax position has expired. Settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash. See Note 14, Income Taxes, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the status of tax audits and uncertain tax positions. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Recent Accounting Pronouncements, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements. NON GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES This Annual Report on Form 10 K includes information extracted from consolidated financial information but not required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) to be presented in the financial statements. Certain of this information are considered non GAAP financial measures as defined by SEC rules. Specifically, we refer to adjusted return on average capital, operating revenue, FMS operating revenue, FMS EBT as a % of operating revenue, SCS operating revenue, SCS EBT as a % of operating revenue, DCC operating revenue, DCC EBT as a % of operating revenue, total cash generated, free cash flow, total obligations, total obligations to equity, and comparable earnings from continuing operations and comparable earnings per diluted common share from continuing operations. As required by SEC rules, we provide a reconciliation of each non GAAP financial measure to the most comparable GAAP measure and an explanation why management believes that presentation of the non GAAP financial measure provides useful information to investors. Non GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for or superior to, other measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. 47 Table of Contents ITEM 7.
