Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following is a discussion and analysis of RAIs business, initiatives, critical accounting policies and its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Following the overview and discussion of business initiatives, the critical accounting policies disclose certain accounting policies that are material to RAIs results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented in this report. The discussion and analysis of RAIs results of operations is presented in two comparative sections, 2005 compared with 2004, and 2004 compared with 2003. Disclosures related to liquidity and financial condition complete managements discussion and analysis. You should read this discussion and analysis of RAIs consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, and for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2005. Overview and Business Initiatives RAIs operating subsidiaries include RJR Tobacco, Santa Fe, Lane and GPI. RAIs single reportable operating segment, RJR Tobacco, is the second largest cigarette manufacturer in the United States. RAI facilitated the July 30, 2004, transactions to combine the U.S. assets, liabilities and operations of B&W with RJR Tobacco, a wholly owned operating subsidiary of RJR. As part of the combination transactions, RAI also acquired Lane. Santa Fe manufactures and markets cigarettes and other tobacco products primarily in the United States. Lane manufactures or distributes cigars, roll your own, cigarette and pipe tobacco brands primarily in the United States. GPI manufactures and exports cigarettes to U.S. territories, U.S. duty free shops and U.S. overseas military bases, and manages a contract manufacturing business. RAIs operating subsidiaries primarily conduct business in the highly competitive U.S. cigarette market with a few large manufacturers and many smaller participants. The U.S. cigarette market is believed to be a mature market, and overall consumer demand is expected to continue to decline over time. Trade inventory adjustments may result in short term changes in demand for its operating subsidiaries products if, and when, wholesale and retail tobacco distributors adjust the timing of their purchases of product to manage their inventory levels. However, RAI believes it is not appropriate for it to speculate on external factors that may impact the purchasing decision of the wholesale and retail tobacco distributors. Competition is based primarily on brand positioning and price, as well as product attributes and packaging, consumer loyalty, promotions, advertising and retail presence. Cigarette brands produced by the major manufacturers generally require competitive pricing, substantial marketing support, retail programs and other incentives to maintain or improve a brands market position or to introduce a new brand. RAIs operating subsidiaries are committed to building and maintaining a portfolio of profitable brands. RJR Tobaccos marketing programs are designed to strengthen brand image, build brand awareness and loyalty and switch adult smokers of competing brands. In addition to building strong brand equity, RJR Tobaccos marketing approach utilizes a retail pricing strategy, including discounting at retail, to defend certain brands shares of market against competitive pricing pressure. Competitive discounting has increased significantly over time as a result of higher state excise taxes and the growth of deep discount brands. Deep discount brands are brands marketed by manufacturers that are not original participants in the MSA, and accordingly, do not have cost structures burdened with MSA payments to the same extent as the original participating manufacturers. RJR Tobaccos new brand portfolio strategy, which took effect at the beginning of 2005, established three categories of brands: investment, selective support and non support. The investment brands are CAMEL and KOOL, which receive significant resources focused on accelerating their share of market growth. The selective support brands include two full price brands, WINSTON and SALEM, and two savings brands, DORAL and PALL MALL, all of which receive limited support in an effort to optimize profitability. ECLIPSE, a full price brand of cigarettes that primarily heats rather than burns tobacco, is also a selective support brand. The non support brands are managed to maximize near term profitability. RJR Tobacco 58 Table of Contents expects that, over a four to six year time frame, this focused portfolio strategy will result in growth in total RJR Tobacco share, as gains on investment brands offset declines among other brands. Additional 2005 business activity includes the second quarter sale of RJR Tobaccos packaging operations for $48 million and the fourth quarter GPI acquisition from JTI of its U.S. duty free and U.S. overseas military businesses relating to certain brands for $45 million. In June 2005, RJR completed a private offering of $500 million secured notes and in July 2005, RJR repurchased $310 million of notes due in 2006 under a cash tender offer. In February 2006, RJR completed an exchange offer of $500 million secured registered notes for the $500 million secured notes privately placed in June 2005. In January 2006, Lane sold its pipe manufacturing business for $4 million. The financial impacts of these 2005 transactions are described in Results of Operations below. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates GAAP requires estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the reported amounts in RAIs consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Some of these estimates require difficult, subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and as a result, actual results could differ from those estimates. Due to the estimation processes involved, the following summarized accounting policies and their application are considered to be critical to understanding the business operations, financial condition and results of operations of RAI and its subsidiaries. For information related to these and other significant accounting policies, see note 1 to consolidated financial statements. Purchase Accounting RAI accounts for business combination transactions in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, referred to as SFAS, No. 141, Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141 requires that RAI allocate the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their fair values as of the acquisition date. Estimates of fair values for property, plant and equipment, trademarks and other identifiable intangibles generally are based on independent appraisals; pension and postretirement obligations are based on actuarial studies; and other accounts are based on managements best estimates using assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. In addition, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of trademarks and other intangibles with finite lives, are directly related to estimated fair values and estimated useful lives determined as of the acquisition date. The determination of fair values involves considerable estimation and judgment. Among other things, it requires developing forecasts of cash flows and discount rates for trademarks and other intangibles; selecting appropriate valuation bases and methodologies for property, plant and equipment; determining appropriate actuarial assumptions for pensions and postretirement plans; and determining the number and timing of employees to be terminated or relocated and the associated costs. The value of goodwill and trademarks and other intangibles with indefinite lives will be subjected to annual impairment testing that could result in future impairment charges. Changes in the useful lives of property, plant and equipment, trademarks or other intangibles could impact depreciation or, in certain situations, impairment charges. Tobacco Related Litigation RAI and RJR Tobacco disclose information concerning tobacco related litigation for which an unfavorable outcome is more than remote. RJR Tobacco and its affiliates record their legal expenses and other litigation costs and related administrative costs as selling, general and administrative expenses as those costs are incurred. RAI and RJR Tobacco will record any loss related to tobacco litigation at such time as an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate is a range, the recorded loss will be the best estimate within the range. If no amount in the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount of the range will be recorded. As discussed in note 14 to consolidated financial statements, RJR Tobacco and its affiliates, including RAI, and indemnitees, including B&W, have been named in a number of tobacco related legal actions, proceedings or claims seeking damages in amounts ranging into the hundreds of millions or even billions of 59 Table of Contents dollars. Unfavorable judgments awarding compensatory damages, punitive damages and or fines have been returned against RJR Tobacco in the Engle class action case, reversed by the intermediate appellate court on May 21, 2003, and now on appeal to the Florida Supreme Court, the Scott class action case, a small number of individual smoking and health cases, a Broin II flight attendant ETS case and a California state law enforcement action. RJR Tobacco has paid approximately $13 million since 2003 related to unfavorable smoking and health judgments, including attorneys fees, primarily for pre acquisition contingencies related to the business combination. RJR Tobacco believes, however, that it has numerous bases for successful appeals in its pending cases, and both RJR Tobacco and RAI believe they have a number of valid defenses to all actions and intend to defend all actions vigorously. As a result, RAIs management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees, including B&W, when viewed on an individual basis, is not probable. Accordingly, no liability for smoking and health tobacco litigation currently is recorded in RAIs consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2005. As discussed in more detail in note 14 to consolidated financial statements, RJR has liabilities totaling $94 million that were recorded in 1999 in connection with certain indemnification claims asserted by JTI against RJR and RJR Tobacco, relating to the activities of Northern Brands and related litigation. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and it is possible that some of the tobacco related legal actions, proceedings or claims could ultimately be decided against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates, including RAI, and its indemnitees, including B&W. Any unfavorable outcome of such actions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of RAI or its subsidiaries. Settlement Agreements As discussed in Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry in note 14 to consolidated financial statements, RJR Tobacco, Santa Fe and Lane are participants in the MSA, and RJR Tobacco is a participant in other state settlement agreements related to governmental health care cost recovery actions. Their obligations and the related expense charges under the MSA and other state settlement agreements are subject to adjustments based upon, among other things, the volume of cigarettes sold by the operating subsidiaries, their relative market share and inflation. Since relative market share is based on cigarette shipments, the best estimate of the allocation of charges under these agreements is recorded in cost of products sold as the products are shipped. Adjustments to these estimates, which historically have not been significant, are recorded in the period that the change becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. For more information related to historical and expected settlement expenses and payments under the MSA and other state settlement agreements, see Governmental Health Care Cost Recovery Cases MSA and Other State Settlement Agreements in note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Intangible Assets Intangible assets include goodwill, trademarks and other intangibles and are accounted for under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. See note 1 to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment charges in connection with RAIs ongoing application of SFAS No. 142. RAI generally engages an independent appraisal firm to assist it in determining the fair value of its reporting units and trademarks with indefinite lives annually in the fourth quarter. The determination of fair value involves considerable estimates and judgment. In particular, the fair value of a reporting unit involves, among other things, developing forecasts of future cash flows, determining an appropriate discount rate, and when goodwill impairment is implied, determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities, including unrecorded intangibles. Although RAI believes it has based its impairment testing and impairment charges on reasonable estimates and assumptions, the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different results. Generally, if the current competitive environment worsens or RAIs operating companies strategic initiatives adversely affect their financial performance, the fair value of goodwill, trademarks and other intangibles could be impaired in future periods. 60 Table of Contents Pension and Postretirement Benefits RAI and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor a number of non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering most of their employees, and also provide certain health and life insurance benefits for most of their retired employees and their dependents. These benefits are generally no longer provided to employees hired on or after January 1, 2004. For additional information relating to pension and postretirement benefits, see note 17 to consolidated financial statements. As part of the 2004 business combination transactions, RAI assumed certain pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related assets of former B&W plans. The liability for the projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets was recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. All previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss, unrecognized prior service cost, or unrecognized transition obligation or asset existing at the date of the 2004 business combination were eliminated. As a result of the 2004 business combination, the pension benefit obligation and pension assets increased by $1.9 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively, and the postretirement benefit obligation and postretirement assets increased by $621 million and $312 million, respectively. Pension expense is determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits. Postretirement benefit expense is determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. Because pension and other postretirement obligations will ultimately be settled in future periods, the determination of annual expense and liabilities is subject to estimates and assumptions. With the assistance of independent actuarial and investment management firms, RAI reviews these assumptions annually based on historic experience and expected future trends or coincidentally with a major event and modifies them as needed. Demographic assumptions such as termination of employment, mortality or retirement are reviewed periodically as expectations change. Gains or losses are annual changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions. The minimum amortization of unrecognized gains or losses, as described in SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, is included in pension expense. Prior service costs, which are changes in benefit obligations due to plan amendments, are amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period for active employees. The market related value of plan assets excludes deferred asset gains of $311 million and recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years. If the market value of assets had been used to determine pension expense, the impact would have been a decrease to the 2005 costs of $51 million. Approximately $27 million is attributable to the expected return on asset component of expense and $24 million is due to the gain/loss amortization component. The minimum amortization of unrecognized gains or losses, as described in SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, is also included in the postretirement benefit expense. Prior service costs, which are changes in benefit obligations due to plan amendments, are amortized on a straight line basis over the service to expected full eligibility age for active employees, or average remaining life expectancies for inactive employees if most of the plan obligations are due to inactive employees. The market related value of plan assets excludes deferred asset gains of $29 million and recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years. If the market value of assets had been used to determine postretirement benefit expense, the impact would have been a decrease to the 2005 costs of $2 million, all attributable to the expected return on asset component of expense. 61 Table of Contents The most critical assumptions and their sensitivity to change are presented below: Pension Postretirement Benefits Benefits 2005 2004 2005 2004 Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31: Discount rate 5.90 % 6.05 % 5.90 % 6.05 % Rate of compensation increase 4.97 % 4.77 % 5.00 % 4.79 % RAI uses a hypothetical bond matching analysis to determine the discount rate. Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits All Plans 2005 2004 2005 2004 2003 Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended December 31: Discount rate 6.05%/5.70% (1) 6.15%/6.27% (3) 6.05%/5.70%/5.75% (2) 6.15%/6.45% (4) 6.40%/6.50% (5) Expected long term return on plan assets 8.79% 8.79% 8.50% 8.50% 9.00% Rate of compensation increase 4.97% 4.77% 5.00% 4.79% 5.00% (1) The January 1, 2005 overall beginning discount rate of 6.05% was changed to 5.70% for the period from April 30, 2005 to December 31, 2005, for plans impacted by the sale of RJR Tobaccos packaging operations. (2) The January 1, 2005 overall beginning discount rate of 6.05% was changed for the pre combination RJR Tobacco benefit plans only, to a discount rate of 5.70% for the period April 30, 2005 to September 15, 2005, and a discount rate of 5.75% was used for the period from September 15, 2005 to December 31, 2005. (3) A discount rate of 6.15% was used for the period from January 1, 2004 to July 31, 2004, and a weighted average discount rate of 6.27% was used for the period from August 1, 2004 to December 31, 2004, to reflect the impact of the business combination. (4) A discount rate of 6.15% was used for the period from January 1, 2004 to July 31, 2004, and a weighted average discount rate of 6.45% was used for the period from August 1, 2004 to December 31, 2004, to reflect the impact of the business combination. (5) A discount rate of 6.40% was used for the period from January 1, 2003 to August 31, 2003, and adjusted to a discount rate of 6.50% for the period from September 1, 2003 to December 31, 2003, to reflect the impact of the 2003 restructuring plan. The overall expected long term rate of return on assets assumptions for pension and postretirement assets are based on: (1) the target asset allocation for plan assets, (2) long term capital markets forecasts for asset classes employed, and (3) excess return expectations of active management to the extent asset classes are actively managed. 62 Table of Contents Assumption Sensitivity: Assumed asset return and discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the benefit plans. A one percentage point change in assumed discount rate for the pension plans and other postretirement plans would have the following effects: 1 Percentage Point 1 Percentage Point Increase Decrease Pensions Postretirement Pensions Postretirement Plans Plans Plans Plans Effect on 2005 net periodic benefit cost $ (18 ) $ (2 ) $ 20 $ 4 Effect on December 31, 2005, projected benefit obligation and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (552 ) (141 ) 619 156 A one percentage point change in assumed asset return would have the following effects: 1 Percentage Point 1 Percentage Point Increase Decrease Pensions Postretirement Pensions Postretirement Plans Plans Plans Plans Effect on 2005 net periodic benefit cost $ (38 ) $ (3 ) $ 38 $ 3 During 2002, actual asset returns for RJRs pension assets were adversely impacted by the continued deterioration of the equity markets and declining interest rates. Additionally, corporate bond yields, which are used in determining the discount rate for future pension obligations, continued to decline. The negative asset returns and declining discount rates unfavorably affected RJRs pension plans funded status. Pension expense in 2003 was adversely impacted due to these factors and the lowering of the expected return on asset assumption from 9.5% per annum for 2002 to 9.0% per annum for 2003. During 2003, pension plan assets increased $391 million, as a result of the favorable 2003 equity market performance, partially offset by benefit payments. Pension benefit obligations increased during 2003 greater than expected due to a decline in discount rates. At December 31, 2003, the pension benefit obligation of RJRs pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $750 million. During 2004, pension plan assets increased $1.9 billion, primarily due to the addition of $1.6 billion in assets assumed in the business combination and as a result of the favorable 2004 equity market performance, partially offset by benefit payments. The pension benefit obligation increased $2.1 billion, primarily due to the addition of $1.9 billion for the former B&W plans and the decline in discount rates, partially offset by benefit payments. At December 31, 2004, the pension benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $956 million. During 2005, pension plan assets increased $238 million, as a result of the favorable 2005 equity market performance and employer contributions, partially offset by benefit payments. Pension benefit obligations increased by $161 million due to a decline in discount rates, partially offset by benefit payments and the sale of RJR Tobaccos packaging operations in May 2005. At December 31, 2005, the pension benefit obligation of RJRs pension plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $879 million. During 2004, RAI assumed $312 million for postretirement plan assets in the business combination. The postretirement benefit obligation increased by $605 million, primarily due to the addition of $621 million for the former B&W plans, partially offset by benefit payments. At December 31, 2004, the postretirement benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $1.1 billion. During 2005, postretirement plan assets increased $15 million, as a result of favorable 2005 equity market performance and employer contributions, partially offset by benefit payments. Postretirement benefit obligations increased by $97 million due to a decline in discount rates, partially offset by benefit payments. At December 31, 2005, the postretirement benefit obligation of RJRs postretirement plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $1.2 billion. RAI does not expect to pre fund any additional postretirement benefit obligations in the future. 63 Table of Contents Subsequent to the 2004 business combination, RAI reviewed the target asset allocations with respect to the former B&W plan assets and made slight adjustments. Beginning with 2006, RAI has adjusted its expected long term rate of return on pension assets to 8.75% for its major plans, from 9.00% and 8.50% in 2005. In 2006, RAI implemented a cap on how much it will pay for medical and dental coverage for retirees as a group, excluding pre 1993 retirees and former B&W retirees. The cap was raised above previous amounts creating an unrecognized prior service cost of $57 million. The prior service cost will be amortized over the number of years, on average, it takes for employees to be fully eligible for benefits. Pension expense in 2006 is expected to be within a range of $40 million to $55 million, compared with expense of $100 million in 2005, primarily due to increased employer contributions. Postretirement benefit expense in 2006 is expected to be within a range of $75 million to $85 million, compared with expense of $68 million in 2005, primarily due to the lower discount rate of 5.90%. The amount by which the pension and postretirement benefit obligations exceed the fair value of the plan assets could increase to the extent of a decline in the fair value of plan assets, as well as adverse changes in actuarial assumptions, including a reduction in the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligations. RAI expects to contribute $231 million to its pension plans in 2006, of which $200 million was contributed in January 2006. Additional cash funding may be made in the future. RAI expects payments related to its postretirement plans to be $76 million in 2006. Differences between actual results and actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods. In recent years, actual results have varied significantly from actuarial assumptions. In particular, pension and postretirement liabilities have increased as a result of the decline in the discount rate. These changes have resulted in charges to comprehensive income. These changes are expected to result in additional pension and postretirement expense in future years and may also require additional cash funding of the pension obligations in the future. The target pension asset allocation is 44% U.S. equity investments, including private equity investments, 18% non U.S. equity investments, 26% debt securities, 8% hedge fund investments, and 3% real estate with a rebalancing range of approximately plus or minus 3% to 5% around the target asset allocations. The target postretirement asset allocation is 40% U.S. equity investments, including private equity investments, 16% non U.S. equity investments, 28% debt securities, 9% hedge fund investments and 5% real estate, and 2% cash with a rebalancing range of approximately plus or minus 5% around the target asset allocations. RAIs pension and postretirement plans weighted average asset allocations at December 31, 2005 and 2004, by asset category were as follows: Plan Assets at December 31, Pensions Postretirement Asset Category 2005 2004 2005 2004 U.S. equity securities 42 % 44 % 47 % 43 % Non U.S. equity securities 19 % 20 % 18 % 17 % Debt securities 26 % 24 % 24 % 27 % Hedge funds 9 % 9 % 5 % 8 % Real estate and other 4 % 3 % 6 % 5 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % 100 % In late 2005, RAI announced an enhancement to its current qualified defined contribution plan beginning January 1, 2006. The amount of the retirement enhancement is based on a sliding scale by providing higher, 64 Table of Contents additional contributions to certain employees closer to retirement with lower additional contributions for certain other employees. This enhanced program is estimated to increase expense by an additional $21 million per year. Revenue Recognition Revenue from product sales is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sellers price to the buyer is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is reasonably assured. For RAIs operating subsidiaries, these criteria are generally met when title and risk of loss pass to the customer. Certain sales of leaf, considered as bill and hold for accounting purposes, are recorded as deferred revenue when all of the above revenue recognition criteria are met except delivery, postponed by the customers request. Revenue is subsequently recognized upon delivery. Shipping and handling costs are classified as cost of products sold. Given the nature of the business of RAIs operating subsidiaries, revenue recognition practices contain no significant estimates that could materially affect their results of operations. Income Taxes Tax law requires certain items to be included in taxable income at different times than as required for book reporting purposes under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. These differences may be permanent or temporary in nature. To the extent a book and tax difference is permanent in nature, that is, the financial treatment differs permanently from the tax treatment under SFAS No. 109, the tax effect of this item is reflected in RAIs effective income tax rate. RAI determines its annual effective income tax rate based on forecasted pre tax book income and forecasted permanent book and tax differences. The rate is established at the beginning of the year and it is evaluated on a quarterly basis. Any changes to the forecasted information or any resolution of an audit with taxing authorities may cause the effective rate to be adjusted. Any required adjustments are made on a prospective basis for the remaining quarters in the year. To the extent that any book and tax differences are temporary in nature, that is, the book realization will occur in a different period than the tax realization, a deferred tax asset or liability is established as required under SFAS No. 109. To the extent that a deferred tax asset is created, management evaluates RAIs ability to realize this asset. Management currently believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will be realized. To the extent a deferred tax liability is established under SFAS No. 109, it is recorded, tracked and once it becomes currently due and payable, it is paid to the taxing authorities. In the fourth quarter of 2005, RAI recorded an adjustment of $13 million as a decrease in income tax expense and a corresponding decrease in deferred tax liabilities. This adjustment resulted from differences between the deferred tax liabilities recorded in prior periods and the underlying cumulative timing differences supporting them. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, the resolution of certain prior years tax matters resulted in reduction of income tax expense of $78 million, $126 million and $169 million, respectively. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, RAI recorded an adjustment to tax expense included in discontinued operations of $1 million, $6 million and $97 million, respectively, related to the gain on the 1999 sale of RJRs international tobacco business. Including these adjustments, the net after tax gain on the sale of the international tobacco business was $2.5 billion. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, RAI recorded an adjustment of $55 million, $49 million and $121 million, respectively, to the gain related to the acquisition of RJRs former parent, NGH, which occurred in 2000, primarily reflecting the favorable resolution of associated tax matters. Including this adjustment, the net after tax gain on the acquisition of NGH was $1.7 billion. On January 9, 2006, RAI was notified that the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation approved a tax refund of $65 million, including interest. The refund will be recorded as an extraordinary gain in the first 65 Table of Contents quarter of 2006. This approval by the Joint Committee also finalizes the Internal Revenue Services audit of RAIs tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000. RAI expects to apply the cash refund against other federal income tax obligations in 2006. The financial statements reflect managements best estimate of RAIs current and deferred tax liabilities and assets. Future events, including but not limited to, additional resolutions with taxing authorities could have an impact on RAIs current estimate of tax liabilities, realization of tax assets and upon RAIs effective income tax rate. Recent Accounting Developments In November 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Staff Position FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 amends SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, SFAS No. 124, Accounting for Certain Investments Held by Not for Profit Organizations and Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments. FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 addresses the determination as to when an investment is considered to be impaired, whether that impairment is other than temporary, and the measurement of an impairment loss. This FSP also includes accounting considerations subsequent to the recognition of other than temporary impairment. FSP FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1 is effective for RAI as of January 1, 2006. RAI does not expect the adoption of this FSP to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In October 2005, the FASB issued FSP FAS 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred during Construction Period. FSP FAS 13 1 clarifies the accounting for rental costs associated with operating leases that are incurred during a construction period. In addition, FSP FAS 13 1 requires that a lessee shall cease capitalizing rental costs as of the effective date of FSP FAS 13 1 for operating lease arrangements entered into prior to the effective date of FSP FAS 13 1. FSP FAS 13 1 is effective for RAI as of January 1, 2006. RAI does not expect the adoption of FSP FAS 13 1 to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In September 2005, the FASBs EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 04 13, Inventory Exchanges. EITF No. 04 13 requires two or more inventory transactions with the same party to be considered a single nonmonetary transaction subject to APB Opinion No. 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, if the transactions were entered into in contemplation of one another. EITF No. 04 13 is effective for RAI for new arrangements entered into after April 1, 2006. RAI does not expect the adoption of EITF No. 04 13 to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In June 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, which replaces APB No. 20, Accounting Changes, and SFAS No. 3, Reporting Accounting Changes in Interim Financial Statements. SFAS No. 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of voluntary changes in accounting principle and changes required by new accounting standards when the standard does not include specific transition provisions, unless it is impracticable to do so. SFAS No. 154 defines retrospective application as the application of a different accounting principle to prior accounting periods as if that principle had always been used, and redefines restatement as the revising of previously issued financial statements to reflect the correction of an error. SFAS No. 154 is effective for RAI as of January 1, 2006. RAI does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 154 to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4. This statement clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted materials. Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43 allowed some of these costs to be carried as inventory, whereas SFAS No. 151 requires these costs to be recognized as expenses when incurred. Additionally, SFAS No. 151 requires that the allocation of fixed production overheads to the costs of conversion be based on the normal capacity of the production facilities. SFAS No. 151 is effective for 66 Table of Contents RAI as of January 1, 2006. RAI does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 151 to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets an amendment to APB Opinion No. 29. This statement requires exchanges of similar productive assets to now be accounted for at fair value, the basic principle for nonmonetary transactions, unless the exchange lacks commercial substance. SFAS No. 153 is effective for RAI as of January 1, 2006. RAI does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 153 to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. This statement is a revision of SFAS No. 123 and supersedes APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and its related implementation guidance. SFAS No. 123(R) addresses all forms of share based payment awards, including shares issued under employee stock purchase plans, stock options, restricted stock and stock appreciation rights. SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for RAI as of January 1, 2006. RAI does not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) to have a material impact on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows primarily because all of RAIs outstanding stock options are fully vested. Results of Operations 2005 Compared with 2004 For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % Change Net sales(1) $ 8,256 $ 6,437 28.3 % Cost of products sold(1)(2) 4,919 3,872 27.0 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,611 1,455 10.7 % Loss on sale of assets 24 NM (3) Amortization expense 41 24 70.8 % Restructuring and asset impairment charges 2 5 (60.0 )% Goodwill and trademark impairment charges 200 199 Operating income $ 1,459 $ 882 65.4 % (1) Excludes excise taxes of $2,175 million and $1,850 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (2) See Cost of products sold below for further information related to settlement and federal tobacco buyout expense. (3) Percent change is not meaningful. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005, increased $1.8 billion from the comparable prior year, primarily due to increased volume of $1.3 billion, driven by the business combination, and higher pricing net of higher discounting. Net sales also includes an increase of $236 million due to related party sales, primarily relating to contract manufacturing for BAT affiliates. RAIs net sales are dependent upon its shipment volume in a declining market, full price versus savings brand mix, and list pricing, offset by promotional spending, trade incentives and federal excise taxes. 67 Table of Contents Domestic cigarette shipment volume, in billions of units, for RAIs operating subsidiaries and the industry segments were as follows(1): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % Change RJR Tobacco investment brands: CAMEL excluding Regular 22.0 21.6 1.9% KOOL 11.8 4.9 NM(3) RJR Tobacco selective support brands: DORAL 17.1 18.3 (6.4)% WINSTON 14.2 14.8 (4.0)% SALEM 7.6 8.9 (14.2)% PALL MALL Savings 5.8 2.5 NM(3) RJR Tobacco non support brands 28.8 20.6 NM(3) RJR Tobacco total full price 64.8 57.0 13.8% RJR Tobacco total savings 42.6 34.6 22.8% RJR Tobacco total domestic 107.4 91.6 17.2% Other 2.5 2.2 10.4% RAI total domestic 109.8 93.8 17.0% Industry(2): Full price 271.3 274.4 (1.1)% Savings 109.7 120.1 (8.6)% Industry total domestic 381.0 394.5 (3.4)% (1) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. (2) Based on information from MSAi. These amounts, including the restatement of prior periods, reflect revised methodology adopted to better estimate industry volume. (3) Percent change is not meaningful due to only five months of sales in 2004 for KOOL, PALL MALL and other former B&W brands. RJR Tobaccos full year total domestic shipment volume increased 17.2% reflecting the impact of the business combination offset in part by the changes in the brand strategy implemented in 2005, the underlying declines in consumption, or retail sales to consumers and two less shipping days compared with 2004. Shipments in the full priced tier decreased to 60.4% of RJR Tobaccos total domestic shipments during 2005 as compared with 62.2% in 2004. This decrease is primarily due to the combination of the former B&W brands beginning in August 2004, which were more heavily weighted in the savings category. Industry full price shipments as a percentage of total domestic shipments increased to 71.2% in 2005 from 69.6% in 2004. 68 Table of Contents The shares of U.S. retail cigarette sales of RJR Tobacco are presented as if the portfolio resulting from the business combination had been combined as of the beginning of 2004. The shares of RJR Tobacco as a percentage of total share of U.S. retail cigarette sales according to data(1) from IRI were as follows(2): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Share Point 2005 2004 Change RJR Tobacco investment brands: CAMEL excluding Regular 6.68 % 6.28 % 0.40 KOOL 2.98 % 2.80 % 0.18 RJR Tobacco selective support brands: DORAL 4.68 % 4.98 % (0.30 ) WINSTON 4.02 % 4.16 % (0.14 ) SALEM 2.19 % 2.59 % (0.39 ) PALL MALL Savings 1.54 % 1.49 % 0.05 RJR Tobacco non support brands 7.88 % 8.52 % (0.63 ) RJR Tobacco total domestic 29.98 % 30.82 % (0.84 ) (1) Retail share of U.S. cigarette sales data is included in this document because it is used by RJR Tobacco primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants and brands and market trends. You should not rely on the market share data reported by IRI as being a precise measurement of actual market share because IRI is not able to effectively track all volume. Moreover, you should be aware that in a product market experiencing overall declining consumption, a particular product can experience increasing market share relative to competing products, yet still be subject to declining consumption volumes. (2) RJR Tobacco expects that IRI may revise its data regarding participants shares of U.S. retail cigarette sales. Data provided herein speaks only as of the date of this report. The 2005 retail share of market of CAMELs filtered styles continued to grow compared with 2004 based on the strength of the brands equity, driven by its Pleasure to Burn positioning. In addition, RJR Tobacco launched Turkish Silver in April 2005. Initiatives launched in prior years to actively market CAMELs three distinct product families Classic, Turkish and Exotic Blends also contributed to the brands performance in 2005. In 2005, KOOL also increased its share to its highest level since 1999 and continues to maintain its appeal among adult menthol smokers. During 2005, RJR Tobacco introduced KOOLs Be True advertising campaign and launched the KOOL menthol lights box style to support KOOLs future growth potential. The combined share of market of the investment brands grew 0.58% during 2005 compared with 0.28% growth during 2004. However, the decline in share of selective support and non support brands more than offset the gains on the investment brands. Within the selective support brands, PALL MALL savings continued to show slight share growth during 2005. The share results for 2005 were in line with the current brand portfolio strategy. RJR Tobaccos full price share position of 18.4% of the market in 2005 declined 0.19 share points from 2004, compared with the 2004 decline from 2003 of 0.40 share points. RJR Tobaccos savings share position of 11.6% of the market in 2005 declined 0.65 share points from 2004, compared with the 2004 decline from 2003 of 0.87 share points. Cost of products sold increased $1.0 billion from 2004 primarily due to increased MSA settlement and federal tobacco buyout expenses, as detailed in the schedule below. The increase in cost of products sold also was driven by integration costs of $14 million and $364 million higher product costs primarily related to volume of acquired operations, including BAT contract manufacturing. 69 Table of Contents Cost of products sold includes the following components for MSA and other state settlements, and federal tobacco buyout expenses for the years ended December 31: 2005 2004 2003 Settlement $ 2,641 $ 2,252 $ 1,934 Phase II growers liability offset (79 ) (69 ) Phase II growers expense 38 Total settlement expense $ 2,600 $ 2,183 $ 1,934 Federal tobacco quota buyout $ 264 $ 70 $ Federal quota tobacco stock liquidation assessment 81 Total quota buyout expense $ 345 $ 70 $ MSA expenses are expected to be approximately $2.6 billion in 2006, subject to adjustment for changes in volume and other factors and the federal tobacco quota buyout is expected to be approximately $260 million in 2006. For additional information, see Governmental Health Care Cost Recovery Cases MSA and Other State Settlement Agreements and Tobacco Buyout Legislation in note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1,611 million during 2005 increased $156 million, compared with 2004, primarily due to increased legal expenses and other increased costs related to acquired operations, partially offset by $33 million growers settlement and $17 million related to a California settlement recorded in 2004 and lower integration costs of $93 million in 2005 compared with $130 million in 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs of litigating and administering product liability claims, as well as other legal expenses. During 2005 and 2004, RJR Tobaccos product liability defense costs were $153 million and $115 million, respectively. The increase in product liability defense costs in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily related to the assumption of certain B&W litigation as a result of the business combination and the Department of Justice case. Product liability cases generally include smoking and health related cases. In particular, these cases include the following categories of cases listed in the table set forth in Litigation Affecting the Cigarette IndustryOverview in note 14 to consolidated financial statements: Individual Smoking and Health; Flight Attendant ETS (Broin II); Class Actions; Governmental Health Care Cost Recovery; Other Health Care Cost Recovery and Aggregated Claims; and Asbestos Contribution. Product liability defense costs include the following items: direct and indirect compensation, fees and related costs and expenses for internal legal and related administrative staff administering product liability claims; fees and cost reimbursements paid to outside attorneys; direct and indirect payments to third party vendors for litigation support activities; expert witness costs and fees; and payments to fund legal defense costs for the now dissolved Council for Tobacco Research U.S.A. 70 Table of Contents Numerous factors affect the amount of product liability defense costs. The most important factors are the number of cases pending and the number of cases in trial or in preparation for trial (i.e., with active discovery and motions practice). See Litigation Affecting the Cigarette IndustryOverview in note 14 to consolidated financial statements for detailed information regarding the number and type of cases pending, and Litigation Affecting the Cigarette IndustryScheduled Trials in note 14 to consolidated financial statements for detailed information regarding the number and nature of cases in trial and scheduled for trial through the end of 2006. RJR Tobacco expects that the factors described above will continue to have the primary impact on its product liability defense costs in the future. Given the level of activity in cases in preparation for trial, in trial and on appeal and the amount of product liability defense costs incurred by RJR Tobacco over the past three years, RJR Tobaccos recent experiences in defending its product liability cases and the reasonably anticipated level of activity in RJR Tobaccos pending cases and possible new cases, RJR Tobacco does not expect that the variances in its product liability defense costs will be significantly different than they have been historically, aside from the assumption of certain B&W litigation. However, it is possible that adverse developments in the factors discussed above, as well as other circumstances beyond the control of RJR Tobacco, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of RAI or its subsidiaries. Those other circumstances beyond the control of RJR Tobacco include the results of present and future trials and appeals, and the development of possible new theories of liability by plaintiffs and their counsel. Loss on sale of assets of $24 million relates to RJR Tobaccos sale of its packaging operations on May 2, 2005, to a consortium of five packaging companies for $48 million. RJR Tobacco agreed to provide severance and related benefits to employees who would not receive offers for ongoing employment from the consortium of buyers. Accordingly, the loss includes approximately $27 million for severance and related benefits to be paid by RJR Tobacco to approximately 170 employees out of approximately 740 employees who served the packaging operations at the time of disposition. RJR Tobacco also agreed to provide a transition bonus to eligible employees who continue to work during the transition period, which is expected to be up to 24 months from the date of closing. With the termination of the packaging employees, RJR Tobacco incurred a net curtailment gain of $10 million, reflecting $3 million of pension expense and $13 million of postretirement income. Pursuant to various supply contracts entered into between the buyers and RJR Tobacco, RJR Tobacco will continue to obtain its packaging materials from certain of the buyers. As a result of certain transitional supply pricing, which is above current market prices, $14 million was accrued as part of the loss. Accordingly, anticipated purchases over the transition period will be recorded at approximate current market prices. Amortization expense of $41 million and $24 million were recorded during 2005 and 2004, respectively, relating to intangibles acquired in the business combination and finite lived trademarks. For additional information, see note 1 to consolidated financial statements. Restructuring and asset impairment charge adjustments in 2005 resulted in net additional charges of $2 million relating to the 2002 restructuring. Adjustments in 2004 resulted in net additional charges of $38 million relating to the 2002 restructuring partially offset by net reversals of $33 million relating to the 2003 restructuring. 71 Table of Contents The components of the 2003 restructuring and asset impairment charges, recorded and utilized were as follows: Employee Contract Severance Asset Termination/ and Benefits Impairment Exit Costs Total Original charge $ 292 $ 28 $ 53 $ 373 Utilized in 2003 (92 ) (28 ) (52 ) (172 ) Balance, December 31, 2003 200 1 201 Incurred in 2004 1 1 Utilized in 2004 (91 ) (2 ) (93 ) Adjusted in 2004 (34 ) (34 ) Balance, December 31, 2004 75 75 Utilized in 2005 (58 ) (58 ) Balance, December 31, 2005 $ 17 $ $ $ 17 During 2003, in response to continuing challenges of an intensely competitive environment, RJR and RJR Tobacco incurred restructuring and asset impairment charges of $373 million, or $225 million after tax. Of these charges, RJR Tobacco incurred $287 million related to severance and benefits, $28 million related to asset impairments, primarily reflecting abandonment of certain merchandising fixtures not yet shipped to retailers, and $34 million related to professional fees for valuation and consulting services, as well as the discontinuation of certain event marketing programs and other associated exit costs. The remaining $24 million was incurred by RJR. During 2004, RJR Tobacco decided that approximately 750 sales positions that were expected to be outsourced would not be eliminated and had approximately 100 other less than expected workforce reductions, primarily in manufacturing. Accordingly, associated severance and related benefits of $34 million, or $20 million after tax, was reversed from the restructuring charge during 2004. After the adjustments during 2004, the workforce reduction was approximately 22%, or approximately 1,680 full time employees, in operations and corporate functions. The workforce reduction was substantially completed during the fourth quarter of 2004. The remaining accrual represents severance that will substantially be paid by December 31, 2007. The cash portion of the restructuring and asset impairment charges to date is approximately $225 million, of which $171 million relates to employee severance costs and $54 million relates to exit costs. As of December 31, 2005, $208 million of this amount had been paid. Of the $115 million non cash portion of the charges, $87 million related to benefit charges and $28 million related to asset impairments. In the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005, $14 million is included in other current liabilities and $3 million is included in other noncurrent liabilities. No significant additional charges are expected to be incurred in connection with the 2003 restructuring plan. Cost savings related to the 2003 restructuring charges were $252 million during 2005, and are expected to be $258 million on an annualized basis thereafter. 72 Table of Contents The components of the 2002 restructuring and asset impairment charges, recorded and utilized were as follows: Employee Contract Severance Asset Termination/ and Benefits Impairment Exit Costs Total Original charge $ 102 $ 115 $ 7 $ 224 Utilized in 2002 (44 ) (115 ) (2 ) (161 ) Balance, December 31, 2002 58 5 63 Utilized in 2003 (27 ) (27 ) Adjusted in 2003 (2 ) (3 ) (5 ) Balance, December 31, 2003 29 2 31 Incurred in 2004 40 40 Utilized in 2004 (23 ) (40 ) (63 ) Adjusted in 2004 (2 ) (2 ) Balance, December 31, 2004 4 2 6 Incurred in 2005 3 3 Utilized in 2005 (3 ) (3 ) (6 ) Adjusted in 2005 (1 ) (1 ) Balance, December 31, 2005 $ 1 $ $ 1 $ 2 In 2002, RJR Tobacco recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of $224 million, $135 million after tax, in response to changing competitive practices within the tobacco industry. During 2004, RJR Tobacco reversed $2 million for employee severance and benefits, due to less than expected workforce reductions. As adjusted, the employee severance and benefits relate to the elimination of approximately 500 full time positions in operations support and corporate functions, which were substantially completed as of December 31, 2004. The asset impairment resulted from the remeasurement of the non tobacco businesses at the lower of their carrying value or fair value less cost to sell. Based on the results of negotiations, a revaluation of the fair value of RJR Tobaccos packaging operations resulted in additional impairment of $40 million in the fourth quarter of 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2005, the remaining assets relating to the additional non tobacco business were revalued and resulted in additional impairment of $3 million. Assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale in the consolidated balance sheets are classified in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. As of December 31, 2005, $5 million was classified as assets held for sale, primarily for equipment and facilities related to the Lane pipe manufacturing business, and was unrelated to the 2002 restructuring. As of December 31, 2004, the carrying amounts of the major classes of assets and liabilities in the disposal group included $14 million of accounts receivable, $31 million of inventories, $7 million of property, plant and equipment and other, and $11 million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities. RJR Tobacco completed the sale of one of the non tobacco businesses in the second quarter of 2003 and the sale of its packaging operations during the second quarter of 2005. Contract termination and exit costs included certain contract terminations and lease terminations of 15 sales offices. Exit costs also included the separation of the non tobacco businesses held for sale. During 2003, $5 million of the charge was reversed, reflecting less than expected workforce reductions and exit costs of field sales offices. During 2005, $1 million of the charge was reversed relating to the sale of the packaging operations. The cash portion of the 2002 restructuring and asset impairment charges is expected to be $55 million and primarily relates to employee severance costs. As of December 31, 2005, $53 million of this amount had 73 Table of Contents been paid. The $204 million non cash portion included $44 million related to employee benefits, $158 million related to asset impairments and $2 million related to the write off of prepaid promotional rights that were terminated. In the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2005, $2 million is included in other current liabilities. Cost savings related to the 2002 restructuring charges were $60 million during 2005, and are expected to be $60 million on an annualized basis thereafter. Goodwill and trademark impairment charges include $198 million for trademark impairments compared with $199 million incurred during 2004. Also in 2005, $2 million of goodwill impairment charges was incurred relating to the excess of book value over fair value of assets reclassified to held for sale concerning Lanes pipe manufacturing business. This business was sold on January 26, 2006 for $4 million. In connection with the annual impairment testing of goodwill and certain intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2005, impairment occurred on seven of RJR Tobaccos non investment brands, primarily DORAL, WINSTON and SALEM. The impairment primarily reflects modification during the fourth quarter of 2005, to the previously anticipated level of support between certain brands, and also results from the 2006 strategic plan projecting net sales of certain brands to decline at a faster rate than was assumed in the 2004 annual impairment test. Accordingly, RJR Tobacco recorded impairment charges of $198 million based on the excess of certain brands carrying values over their fair values, determined with the assistance of an independent appraisal firm, using the present value of estimated future cash flows assuming a discount rate of 11.0%. The discount rate was determined by adjusting the RJR Tobacco enterprise discount rate by an appropriate risk premium to reflect an asset group risk. These impairment charges are reflected as decreases in the carrying value of the trademarks in the consolidated balance sheet, as goodwill and trademark impairment charges in the 2005 consolidated income statement and had no impact on cash flows. In connection with the annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2004, impairment occurred on five of RJR Tobaccos non investment brands, primarily WINSTON, SALEM and DORAL. The impairment primarily reflects RJR Tobaccos decision in the fourth quarter of 2004, in conjunction with the implementation of the brand strategies resulting from the business combination, to limit investment in these brands in an effort to optimize profitability. Accordingly, RJR Tobacco recorded impairment charges of $199 million based on the excess of certain brands carrying values over their fair values, determined using the present value of estimated future cash flows assuming a discount rate of 11.0%. The discount rate was determined by adjusting the RJR Tobacco enterprise discount rate by an appropriate risk premium to reflect an asset group risk. These impairment charges are reflected as decreases in the carrying value of the trademarks in the consolidated balance sheet, as goodwill and trademark impairment charges in the 2004 consolidated income statement and had no impact on cash flows. In addition, the extent of the sales decline projected for certain brands that will no longer receive marketing support indicated that a definite life is probable. As a result, the carrying values of these brands are being amortized over their remaining lives, which range from 5 to 15 years, consistent with the pattern of economic benefits estimated to be received. Interest and debt expense was $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $28 million from 2004. This increase is primarily due to higher average debt balances, resulting from the June 2005 private offering, in addition to higher interest rates impacting interest rate swaps. Interest income was $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $55 million from 2004. This increase is primarily due to higher interest rates and, to a lesser extent, higher average cash balances. Other (income) expense, net was $15 million expense in 2005 compared with $2 million income in 2004. The change was primarily due to $7 million of net costs related to the extinguishment of the 2006 notes and unfavorable foreign exchange revaluation. Provision for (benefit from) income taxes was a provision of $431 million, or an effective rate of 30.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with a provision of $202 million, or an effective rate of 24.4%, in 2004. The 2005 provision was impacted mainly by the resolution of certain prior years tax matters 74 Table of Contents that resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of $78 million and $14 million deduction as a result of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, offset in part by state taxes and certain nondeductible items. In the fourth quarter of 2005, RAI recorded an adjustment of $13 million as a decrease in income tax expense and a corresponding decrease in deferred tax liabilities. This adjustment resulted from differences between the deferred tax liabilities recorded in prior periods and the underlying cumulative timing differences supporting them. The 2004 provision was impacted by the resolution of certain prior years tax matters of $126 million, offset in part by state taxes and certain nondeductible items. RAI expects its effective tax rate to approximate 37.5% in 2006. Discontinued operations reflect transactions related to the 1999 sale of the international tobacco business to JTI. During 2005 and 2004, these transactions included $2 million and $12 million, respectively, of after tax reversals of indemnification accruals. Including these adjustments, the net after tax gain on the sale of the international tobacco business was $2.5 billion. Extraordinary items included a gain of $55 million and $49 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to the 2000 acquisition of RJRs former parent, NGH, primarily from settlement of tax matters. Including these adjustments, the net after tax gain on the acquisition was $1.7 billion. On January 9, 2006, RAI was notified that the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation approved a tax refund of $65 million, including interest. The refund will be recorded as an extraordinary gain in the first quarter of 2006. This approval by the Joint Committee also finalizes the Internal Revenue Services audit of RAIs tax returns for the years 1997 through 2000. RAI expects to apply the cash refund against other federal income tax obligations in 2006. 2004 Compared with 2003 For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2004 2003 % Change Net sales(1) $ 6,437 $ 5,267 22.2 % Cost of products sold(1)(2) 3,872 3,218 20.3 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,455 1,327 9.6 % Amortization expense 24 Fixture impairment 106 Restructuring and asset impairment charges 5 368 NM(3) Goodwill and trademark impairment charges 199 4,089 NM(3) Operating income (loss) $ 882 $ (3,841 ) (1) Excludes excise taxes of $1,850 million and $1,572 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. (2) Includes settlement expense of $2,183 million, after elimination of MSA Phase II growers liability of $69 million, and $1,934 million for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Includes federal tobacco buyout expense of $70 million during 2004. (3) Percent change is not meaningful. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004, increased $1,170 million from the comparable prior year, primarily due to increased volume of $1,108 million, driven by the acquired operations and slightly higher pricing due to lower promotional spending. RAIs net sales are dependent upon its shipment volume in a declining market, full price versus savings brand mix, and list pricing, offset by promotional spending, trade incentives and federal excise taxes. 75 Table of Contents Domestic cigarette shipment volume, in billions of units, for RAIs operating segments including acquired operations since July 30, 2004, shown in the 2005 brand designations, were as follows: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, % 2004 2003 Change RJR Tobacco investment brands: CAMEL excluding Regular 21.6 20.0 8.1 % KOOL 4.9 NM RJR Tobacco selective support brands: DORAL 18.3 21.2 (13.8 )% WINSTON 14.8 15.7 (5.5 )% SALEM 8.9 9.3 (4.6 )% PALL MALL Savings 2.5 NM RJR Tobacco non support brands 20.6 13.8 49.3 % RJR Tobacco total full price 57.0 49.7 14.5 % RJR Tobacco total savings 34.6 30.3 14.5 % RJR Tobacco total domestic 91.6 80.0 14.5 % Other 2.4 2.3 7.5 % RAI total domestic 94.0 82.3 14.3 % Industry(1): Full price 274.4 276.1 (0.6 )% Savings 119.5 125.2 (4.5 )% Industry total domestic 393.9 401.3 (1.8 )% (1) Based on information from MSAi.

RJR Tobaccos full year total domestic shipment volume increased 14.5% reflecting the impact of the business combination offset in part by the underlying declines in consumption, or retail sales to consumers. Shipments in the full priced tier remained at 62.2% of RJR Tobaccos total domestic shipments during each of 2004 and 2003. Industry full price shipments as a percentage of total domestic shipments increased to 69.6% in 2004 from 68.8% in 2003. 76 Table of Contents The shares of U.S. retail cigarette sales of RJR Tobacco are presented as if the portfolio had been combined as of the beginning of the periods. The shares of RJR Tobacco as a percentage of total share of U.S. retail cigarette sales according to data from IRI were as follows: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Share Point 2004 2003 Change RJR Tobacco investment brands: CAMEL excluding Regular 6.28 % 5.94 % 0.34 KOOL 2.80 % 2.86 % (0.06 ) RJR Tobacco selective support brands: DORAL 4.98 % 5.54 % (0.56 ) WINSTON 4.16 % 4.49 % (0.33 ) SALEM 2.59 % 2.54 % 0.05 PALL MALL Savings 1.49 % 1.15 % 0.34 RJR Tobacco non support brands 8.52 % 9.57 % (1.05 ) RJR Tobacco total domestic 30.82 % 32.09 % (1.27 ) During 2004, CAMELs filtered styles continued to grow based on the strength of the brands equity, driven by its Pleasure to Burn positioning. Initiatives launched in prior years to actively market CAMELs three distinct product families Classic, Turkish and Exotic Blends also contributed to the brands performance in 2004. KOOLs 2001 repositioning has maintained its appeal among adult menthol smokers and provides potential for future growth. KOOL experienced some softness during mid year 2004 due to increased competition in the menthol category, but improved its performance in the fourth quarter, and its share was relatively stable for the full year. The combined share of market on the investment brands during 2004 showed improvement over 2003. However, the decline in share of selective support and non support brands more than offset the gains on the investment brands. This decline was partially driven by RJR Tobaccos strategic shifts in 2003 on WINSTON, DORAL and private label brands. SALEMs share was relatively stable in 2004, reflecting results of its 2003 repositioning, and PALL MALL savings has increased share attributable to increased consumer acceptance and its savings brand price position. RJR Tobaccos full price share position of 18.6% of the market in 2004 declined 0.40 share points from 2003. RJR Tobaccos savings share position of 12.2% of the market in 2004 declined 0.87 share points from 2003. Cost of products sold increased $654 million from 2003 primarily due to acquired operations. MSA expenses were $2.2 billion in 2004, after elimination of MSA Phase II growers liability of $69 million. In addition, the 2004 cost of products sold included $70 million related to the federal tobacco quota buyout legislation. For more information related to the MSA, see note 14 to consolidated financial statements, and for more information related to the tobacco quota buyout legislation, see Governmental Activity below and note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1,455 million during 2004 increased $128 million, compared with 2003, primarily due to additional costs related to acquired operations, integration costs, $33 million growers settlement and $17 million related to a California settlement. These increases were partially offset by lower overall marketing expense, the elimination of fixture amortization and lower legal expense. 77 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs of litigating and administering product liability claims, as well as other legal expenses. During 2004 and 2003, RJR Tobaccos product liability defense costs were $115 million and $144 million, respectively. The decrease in product liability defense costs in 2004 compared with 2003 was primarily due to a decrease in the level of activity in cases in preparation for trial, in trial and on appeal. Amortization expense of $24 million in 2004 includes $18 million relating to the acquired intangibles for contract manufacturing, customer contracts, consumer database and patents and $6 million trademark amortization relating to several definite lived, non support brands. For additional information, see note 1 to consolidated financial statements. Fixture impairment charges of $106 million in 2003 were non cash charges related to transfer of ownership of RJR Tobaccos retail merchandising fixtures to cigarette retailers and reflect the elimination of the carrying value of the fixtures. As a result of this transfer, no further amortization is required. During 2003, amortization related to the fixtures was $66 million. Restructuring and asset impairment charge adjustments in 2004 resulted in net additional charges of $38 million relating to the 2002 restructuring partially offset by net reversals of $33 million relating to the 2003 restructuring. Goodwill and trademark impairment charges of $199 million were incurred in 2004 compared with $4,089 million incurred during 2003. In connection with the annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2004, impairment occurred on five of RJR Tobaccos non investment brands, primarily WINSTON, SALEM and DORAL. The impairment primarily reflects RJR Tobaccos decision in the fourth quarter of 2004, in conjunction with the implementation of the brand strategies resulting from the business combination, to limit investment in these brands in an effort to optimize profitability. Accordingly, RJR Tobacco recorded impairment charges of $199 million based on the excess of certain brands carrying values over their fair values, determined using the present value of estimated future cash flows assuming a discount rate of 11.0%. The discount rate was determined by adjusting the RJR Tobacco enterprise discount rate by an appropriate risk premium to reflect an asset group risk. These impairment charges are reflected as decreases in the carrying value of the trademarks in the consolidated balance sheet, as goodwill and trademark impairment charges in the 2004 consolidated income statement and had no impact on cash flows. In addition, the extent of the sales decline projected for certain brands that will no longer receive marketing support indicated that a definite life is probable. As a result, the carrying values of these brands are being amortized over their remaining lives, which range from 5 to 11 years. In 2003, in response to competitive changes in the tobacco industry, RJR Tobacco initiated comprehensive changes in its strategies and cost structure that resulted in a restructuring primarily during the third quarter of 2003. In conjunction with these events, RJR Tobacco tested its goodwill and trademarks for impairment. For the purpose of testing goodwill, the fair value of RJR Tobacco was determined with the assistance of an independent appraisal firm, based on the present value of the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit assuming a discount rate of 10.0%. The determination of this discount rate was based on a weighted average cost of capital using a risk free rate adjusted by a stock beta adjusted risk premium. The valuation, in accordance with SFAS No. 142, indicated that the carrying value of RJR Tobacco exceeded its implied fair value. Estimated fair values were assigned to RJR Tobaccos assets and liabilities to estimate the implied fair value of RJR Tobaccos goodwill. As a result, the carrying amount of the goodwill of RJR Tobacco exceeded its implied fair value by $3.8 billion, and an impairment charge equal to that estimated excess was recognized. This impairment charge was included in goodwill and trademark impairment charges in the consolidated income statements and had no impact on cash flows. The trademark impairment testing indicated that impairment occurred on certain of RJR Tobaccos brands, primarily WINSTON and DORAL, reflecting RJR Tobaccos decision in the third quarter of 2003 to limit investment in these brands in an effort to optimize profitability. Accordingly, RJR Tobacco recorded an impairment charge of $326 million in the third quarter of 2003. This charge was based on the excess of certain brands carrying values over their estimated fair values, determined using the present value of estimated future cash flows assuming a discount rate of 10.5%. The discount rate was determined by adjusting the 78 Table of Contents RJR Tobacco enterprise discount rate by an appropriate risk premium to reflect an asset group risk. This impairment charge was included in goodwill and trademark impairment charges in the consolidated statements of income and had no impact on cash flows. Interest and debt expense was $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, a decrease of $26 million from 2003. This decrease is primarily due to the repayment of $550 million and $191 million in debt in the second and third quarters of 2003, respectively. Other (income) expense, net was $2 million income in 2004 compared with $5 million in 2003. The decrease was primarily due to proceeds from a lease termination in 2003 of $10 million. Partially offsetting this decrease were improved earnings from the R. J. Reynolds Gallaher International Sarl joint venture. Provision for (benefit from) income taxes was a provision of $202 million, or an effective rate of 24.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2004, compared with a benefit of $229 million, or an effective rate of 5.8%, in 2003. The 2004 provision was impacted mainly by the resolution of certain prior years tax matters that resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of $126 million, offset in part by state tax and certain non deductible items. The 2003 benefit included $169 million from a favorable resolution of prior years tax matters, offset primarily by the effect of non deductible goodwill impairment. Discontinued operations reflect transactions related to the 1999 sale of the international tobacco business to JTI. During 2004 and 2003, these transactions included $12 million and $16 million, respectively, of after tax reversals of indemnification accruals. During 2003, these transactions also included $106 million related to favorable resolution of tax matters. Extraordinary items included a gain of $49 million in 2004 and $121 million in 2003 related to the 2000 acquisition of RJRs former parent, NGH, primarily from settlement of tax matters. Liquidity and Financial Condition Liquidity At present, the principal sources of liquidity for RAIs operating subsidiaries business and operating needs are internally generated funds from their operations and borrowings through RJR. Cash flows from operating activities are believed to be sufficient for the foreseeable future to enable the operating subsidiaries to meet their obligations under the MSA and other state settlement agreements, to fund their capital expenditures and to make payments to RJR that, when combined with RJRs cash balance, will enable RJR to make its required debt service payments and to fund RAI to enable it to pay dividends to its shareholders. The negative impact, if any, on the sources of liquidity that could result from a decrease in demand for products due to short term inventory adjustments by wholesale and retail distributors, changes in competitive pricing, or accelerated declines in consumption, cannot be predicted. RAI cannot predict its cash requirements or those of its subsidiaries related to any future settlements or judgments, including cash required to be held in escrow or to bond any appeals, if necessary, and RAI makes no assurance that it or its subsidiaries will be able to meet all of those requirements. 79 Table of Contents Contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 were as follows: Payments Due by Period Less than 1 3 4 5 Total 1 Year Years Years Thereafter Long term debt, exclusive of interest(1) $ 1,724 $ 190 $ 329 $ 498 $ 707 Interest payments related to long term debt(1) 573 112 179 147 135 Operating leases(2) 95 29 32 16 18 Non qualified pension obligations(3) 38 6 12 13 7 Postretirement benefit obligations(3) 753 76 152 152 373 Qualified pension funding(3) 225 225 Purchase obligations(4) 1,839 412 415 329 683 Other noncurrent liabilities(5) 116 N/A 70 6 40 MSA and other state settlement obligations(6) 13,500 2,600 5,400 5,500 Federal tobacco buyout obligations(7) 2,020 260 520 520 720 Total cash obligations $ 20,883 $ 3,910 $ 7,109 $ 7,181 $ 2,683 (1) For more information about RJRs long term debt, see Debt below and note 12 to consolidated financial statements. (2) Operating lease obligations represent estimated lease payments primarily related to office space, automobiles, warehouse space and computer equipment. See note 20 to consolidated financial statements for additional information. (3) For more information about RAIs pension plans and postretirement benefits, see note 17 to consolidated financial statements. Non qualified pension and postretirement benefit obligations captioned under Thereafter include obligations during the next five years only. These obligations are not reasonably estimable beyond ten years. Qualified pension plan funding is based on Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation requirements and tax deductibility and is not reasonably estimable beyond one year. (4) Purchase obligations include commitments to acquire tobacco leaf, leaf processing, media services, capital expenditures and software maintenance. The major component of the purchase obligations, although not believed to be incremental to previously anticipated leaf purchase needs, is the estimated value of the commitment to purchase leaf as a part of the settlement agreement reached in the DeLoach antitrust case. See note 14 to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the DeLoach case. (5) Other noncurrent liabilities include primarily restructuring and bonus compensation. Certain other noncurrent liabilities are excluded from the table above, including RJRs liabilities recorded in 1999 related to certain indemnification claims, for which timing of payments are not estimable. For more information about RJRs indemnification obligations, see note 14 to consolidated financial statements. (6) These obligations are not reasonably estimable beyond five years. For more information about RJR Tobaccos settlement payments, see note 14 to consolidated financial statements. (7) For more information about the tobacco buyout legislation, see Governmental Activity below and note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Commitments as of December 31, 2005 were as follows: Commitment Expiration Period Less than 1 3 Total 1 Year Years Standby letters of credit backed by revolving credit facility $ 25 $ 23 $ 2 Total commitments $ 25 $ 23 $ 2 80 Table of Contents Cash Flows Net cash flows from operating activities of $1.3 billion in 2005 increased $537 million from 2004. This change is primarily due to higher net income, lower restructuring and income tax payments, favorable related party movements and favorable inventory movements due to lower leaf costs, changes in leaf durations and lower finished goods. These increases were offset in part by higher 2005 MSA payments and higher pension funding in 2005. Net cash flows from operating activities increased $155 million to $736 million in 2004, when compared with 2003. This change is primarily due to higher net income, partially offset by the cash utilization of restructuring charges and funding of retirement benefits during 2004. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $989 million in 2005 compared with net cash flows from investing activities of $260 million in 2004. This change is primarily due to the 2005 net purchases of short term investments of $898 million compared with the 2004 net proceeds from the sales of short term investments of $188 million. Also, the 2005 net cash flows used in investing activities include $45 million related to the purchase of the U.S. duty free and U.S. military overseas businesses relating to certain brands from JTI compared with $204 million in net cash proceeds acquired in the 2004 business combination. For 2005, cash flows from investing activities also includes $48 million related to the sale of RJR Tobaccos packaging operations. Net cash flows from investing activities were $260 million in 2004 compared with $641 million in 2003. This change is primarily due to the 2003 higher net proceeds from the sales of short term investments and the liquidation of a trust which effectively defeased subordinated debentures that were acquired with NGH in 2000 and the net cash proceeds acquired in the 2004 business combination. Net cash flows used in financing activities were $450 million in 2005 compared with $467 million in 2004. This change is primarily due to the $499 million debt issuance proceeds in June 2005 less $360 million for repayments of long term debt related to the tender offer for the 2006 notes. This decrease was offset in part by higher dividends paid reflecting primarily the outstanding shares of common stock issued in consideration of the business combination and, to a lesser extent, the increased dividend rate in 2005. Net cash flows used in financing activities were $467 million in 2004 compared with $1,122 million in 2003. This change is primarily due to the use of $741 million to repay notes that matured in 2003. Stock Repurchases RAI repurchases and cancels shares forfeited with respect to the tax liability associated with certain option exercises under the RAI Long Term Incentive Plan, as successor plan to the 1999 LTIP. Additionally, to maintain B&Ws ownership percentage of RAI common stock at 42%, RAI was required to repurchase and cancel shares, dependent upon certain stock issuances through September 2005. During 2005, RAI repurchased 41,777 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $3 million. Dividends On February 1, 2006, RAIs board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.25 per common share. The dividend will be paid on April 3, 2006 to shareholders of record as of March 10, 2006. On an annualized basis, the dividend rate is $5.00 per common share. This 31.6% increase in dividends from the fourth quarter 2004 dividend of $0.95 reflects RAIs policy of paying dividends to the holders of RAIs common stock in an aggregate amount that is approximately 75% of RAIs annual consolidated net income. Capital Expenditures RAIs operating subsidiaries recorded capital expenditures of $110 million, of which $105 million was paid in 2005, $92 million and $70 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2005 and 2004 include $47 million and $23 million, respectively, related to the operations integration resulting from the business combination. RAIs operating subsidiaries plan to spend $160 million to $170 million for capital 81 Table of Contents expenditures during 2006, funded primarily by cash flows from operations. This increase in 2006 is primarily due to increased expenditures for manufacturing equipment, office building improvements and the planned purchase of a previously leased aircraft. RAIs operating subsidiaries capital expenditure programs are expected to continue at a level sufficient to support their strategic and operating needs. There were no material long term commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2005. Debt RJRs revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks has a committed amount of $486 million through January 2007. RJR can use the full credit facility to obtain loans or letters of credit, at its option. Under the terms of the credit facility, RJR is not required to maintain compensating balances; however, RJR pays facility fees of 1.5% per annum of the credit facility committed amount. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at rates based upon the prime rate, the federal funds rate or LIBOR plus, in each case, an applicable interest margin based upon the credit rating assigned to RJRs long term guaranteed, secured debt. The credit facility has restrictive covenants that limit RAIs ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock, and limits RAI and its subsidiaries ability to incur indebtedness, engage in transactions with affiliates, create liens, acquire, sell or dispose of specific assets and engage in specified mergers or consolidations. Under the credit facility, RAIs cumulative dividends and share repurchases generally may not exceed the sum of $500 million plus 75% of cumulative adjusted cash net income. RJRs credit facility is secured by substantially all of RJRs assets, including RJRs stock in RJR Tobacco. Also, certain of RJRs subsidiaries, including RJR Tobacco, and RJRs parent, RAI, have guaranteed RJRs obligations under the credit facility and have pledged substantially all of their assets to secure such guarantees. As described below, the collateral securing RJRs credit facility, and the related guarantees, will be released automatically in certain circumstances. At December 31, 2005, RJR had $25 million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility. No borrowings were outstanding, and the remaining $461 million of the credit facility was available for borrowing. In June 2005, RJR completed a private offering of $300 million of 6.5% secured notes due July 15, 2010, and $200 million of 7.3% secured notes due July 15, 2015. The private offering required RJR to pay additional interest on the foregoing notes at an annual rate of 0.5% if it failed to comply with certain of its obligations under a registration rights agreement covering such notes, including completion of an exchange offer for publicly registered notes no later than February 24, 2006. On December 7, 2005, RJR filed a registration statement with the SEC which became effective January 10, 2006, in order to issue registered notes in exchange for the $500 million privately placed notes issued in June 2005. The terms of the exchange notes are identical to the terms of the private placement notes, except that the transfer restrictions and registration rights relating to the privately placed notes do not apply to the exchange notes. At the expiration of the exchange offer on February 14, 2006, 100% of the privately placed 6.5% secured notes due 2010, and 100% of the privately placed 7.3% secured notes due 2015, had been validly tendered for exchange and not withdrawn, and were accepted by RJR. In conjunction with the private offering, RJR commenced in June 2005, a cash tender offer for any and all of its then outstanding $500 million of 7.75% secured notes due May 15, 2006, referred to as the 2006 Notes, and a consent solicitation to amend the related indenture. The consents were solicited to approve indenture amendments, which eliminated substantially all of the restrictive covenants and one of the events of default with respect to the 2006 Notes. After RJR received the requisite consents to the amendments, RJR, the guarantors of the 2006 Notes and the indenture trustee entered into a supplemental indenture effecting the amendments, which affect only the 2006 Notes. In July 2005, RJR used a portion of the proceeds from the private offering to extinguish approximately $310 million of the 2006 Notes that were tendered pursuant to the tender offer. The remainder of the private offering proceeds will be maintained and used to pay at maturity the 2006 Notes that were not tendered in the offer, or at RJRs discretion, to redeem the 2006 Notes. In accordance with the terms of the amendments, the outstanding 2006 Notes that were not tendered in the offer are no longer secured, but remain guaranteed by RAI and certain of RJRs subsidiaries, as described below. In the third quarter of 2005, RJR recorded $7 million of net costs related to the extinguishment of the 2006 Notes. 82 Table of Contents Unlike RJRs other non bank debt, RJRs secured notes, as well as the 2006 Notes that were not extinguished pursuant to the tender offer and are unsecured, are guaranteed by certain of RJRs subsidiaries, including RJR Tobacco, and its parent, RAI, which entities also guarantee RJRs obligations under RJRs credit facility. Any guarantor that is released from its guarantee under RJRs credit facility also will be released automatically from its guarantee of RJRs notes. RJRs secured notes and the related guarantees are secured by the stock of RJR and the subsidiary guarantors and certain of their subsidiaries, indebtedness of subsidiaries of RJR and the guarantors, to the extent owed to RJR or a guarantor, and principal property of RJR and the subsidiary guarantors. These assets constitute a portion of the security for the obligations of RJR and the guarantors under RJRs credit facility. If these assets are no longer pledged as security for the obligations of RJR and the guarantors under RJRs credit facility, or any other indebtedness of RJR, they will be released automatically as security for RJRs secured notes and the related guarantees. Under the terms of RJRs credit facility, the security therefor will be released automatically at such time that certain debt of RJR is rated investment grade by each of Moodys and S&P. RAIs stock in Santa Fe and CMSI, the parent company of Lane, is excluded from the collateral securing RAIs guarantee of RJRs secured notes and credit facility. Generally, the terms of RJRs guaranteed secured notes restrict the pledge of collateral, sale/leaseback transactions and the transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of RJR and its subsidiaries. Moodys rating of RJRs guaranteed, secured notes is Ba2, negative outlook, and S&Ps rating is BB+, negative outlook. Concerns about, or further lowering of, the ratings of RJRs guaranteed, secured notes by S&P or Moodys could have an adverse impact on RJRs ability to access the debt markets and could increase borrowing costs. However, given the cash balances of RAI and its subsidiaries, RAIs management believes that such concerns about, or further lowering of, such ratings would not have a material adverse impact on RAIs cash flows. As of December 31, 2005, RJR had $1.45 billion of guaranteed, secured notes outstanding, with fixed annual interest rates of 6.5% to 7.875%, due in 2007 through 2015 and $190 million guaranteed, unsecured notes outstanding, at a fixed annual interest rate of 7.75% due in 2006. In addition, as of December 31, 2005, RJR had $89 million of notes outstanding which were neither secured nor guaranteed, at fixed annual interest rates of 8.5% to 9.25%, due in 2007 through 2013. At its option, RJR may redeem any or all of its outstanding notes, in whole or in part at any time, subject to the payment of a make whole premium. RJR uses interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on a portion of its debt obligations. Under certain conditions, including RJRs guaranteed, secured debt remaining either one level below BBB by S&P or Baa3 by Moodys, or lower, any fair value that results in a liability position of the interest rate swaps will require full collateralization with cash or securities. In addition, because RJR and the guarantors, including RAI and RJR Tobacco, have pledged substantially all of their assets, including the stock of certain of their subsidiaries, to secure their obligations under RJRs credit facility, such pledge also has secured their obligations under these interest rate swap agreements. RAI, RJR and their affiliates were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions imposed by their indebtedness at December 31, 2005. Litigation and Settlements Various legal claims, including litigation claiming that lung cancer and other diseases, as well as addiction, have resulted from the use of, or exposure to, RAIs operating subsidiaries products, are pending or may be instituted against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates, including RAI, or indemnitees, including B&W. In one such pending case, Engle v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., a Florida state court jury rendered a punitive damages verdict in July 2000, in favor of the Florida class of plaintiffs of approximately $145 billion, with approximately $36.3 billion and $17.6 billion being assigned to RJR Tobacco and B&W, respectively. RJR Tobacco, B&W and the other defendants appealed this verdict. On May 21, 2003, Floridas Third District Court of Appeal reversed the trial courts final judgment and remanded the case to the Dade County Circuit Court with instructions to decertify the class. On October 23, 2003, the plaintiffs filed a notice seeking review by the Florida Supreme Court. On May 12, 2004, the Florida Supreme Court agreed to review the 83 Table of Contents case. Oral argument occurred on November 3, 2004. Although RJR Tobacco remains confident in the bases for appeal in this case, it cannot predict the final outcome of the appellate process. For further discussion of the Engle case and other litigation and legal proceedings pending against RAI or its affiliates or indemnitees, see note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Even though RAIs management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees, when viewed on an individual basis, is not probable, the possibility of material losses related to tobacco litigation is more than remote. However, RAIs management is unable to predict the outcome of such litigation or to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss. Moreover, notwithstanding the quality of defenses available to it and its affiliates in tobacco related litigation matters, it is possible that RAIs financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of certain pending or future litigation matters. In November 1998, RJR Tobacco, B&W and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers entered into the MSA with attorneys general representing most U.S. states, territories and possessions. As described in note 14 to consolidated financial statements, the MSA imposes a stream of future payment obligations on RJR Tobacco and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers and places significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell cigarettes in the future. For more information related to historical and expected settlement expenses and payments under the MSA and other state settlement agreements, see Governmental Health Care Cost Recovery Cases MSA and Other State Settlement Agreements in note 14 to consolidated financial statements. The MSA and other state settlement agreements have materially adversely affected RJR Tobaccos shipment volumes. RAI believes that these settlement obligations may materially adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition of RAI and RJR Tobacco in future periods. The degree of the adverse impact will depend, among other things, on the rate of decline in U.S. cigarette sales in the premium and discount categories, RJR Tobaccos share of the domestic premium and discount cigarette categories, and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to the MSA and other state settlement agreements. Governmental Activity The marketing, sale, taxation and use of cigarettes have been subject to substantial regulation by government and health officials for many years. Various state governments have adopted or are considering, among other things, legislation and regulations that would: increase their excise taxes on cigarettes; restrict displays and advertising of tobacco products; establish ignition propensity standards for cigarettes; raise the minimum age to possess or purchase tobacco products; ban the sale of flavored cigarette brands; require the disclosure of ingredients used in the manufacture of tobacco products; impose restrictions on smoking in public and private areas; and restrict the sale of tobacco products directly to consumers or other unlicensed recipients, including over the Internet. In addition, during 2006, the U.S. Congress may consider legislation regarding: further increases in the federal excise tax; regulation of cigarette manufacturing and sale by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration; amendments to the Federal Cigarette Labeling and Advertising Act to require additional warnings; reduction or elimination of the tax deductibility of advertising expenses; 84 Table of Contents implementation of a national standard for fire safe cigarettes; regulation of the retail sale of cigarettes over the Internet and in other non face to face retail transactions, such as by mail order and telephone; and banning of the delivery of cigarettes by the U.S. Postal Service. Together with manufacturers price increases in recent years and substantial increases in state and federal excise taxes on cigarettes, these developments have had and will likely continue to have an adverse effect on cigarette sales. Cigarettes are subject to substantial excise taxes in the United States. The federal excise tax per pack of 20 cigarettes is $0.39. All states and the District of Columbia currently impose excise taxes at levels ranging from $0.07 per pack in South Carolina to $2.46 per pack in Rhode Island. In 2005, seven state legislatures increased their cigarette excise tax per pack: Kentucky (from $0.03 to $0.30), Maine (from $1 to $2), New Hampshire (from $0.52 to $0.80), North Carolina (from $0.05 to $0.30 with an additional $0.05 effective in 2006), Ohio (from $0.55 to $1.25), Washington (from $1.425 to $2.025) and Virginia, whose graduated increase of $0.10 per pack (from $0.20 to $0.30) passed in 2004, went into effect. Although not a tax increase, Idaho voted to make permanent $0.29 of the states cigarette excise tax that was scheduled to sunset on June 30, 2005; the tax remains at $0.57 per pack. After consideration of these actions, the weighted average state cigarette excise tax per pack, calculated on a 12 month rolling average, is approximately $0.783. Several states have pending legislation proposing excise tax increases in 2006. Certain local and city jurisdictions, such as New York City and Chicago, also impose excise taxes on cigarettes sold in those jurisdictions. In addition, Minnesota enacted a health impact fee, effective August 1, 2005, that among other things imposes a $0.75 per pack fee on cigarettes, which is in addition to its current cigarette excise tax of $0.48 per pack. The legislation imposing the health impact fee expressly states that its purpose is to recover for the state health care costs related to or caused by tobacco use. RJR Tobacco and certain other tobacco manufacturers and distributors filed a motion in Minnesota state court to enforce provisions of the Minnesota settlement agreement, which in the view of RJR Tobacco and the other moving parties released any right the state might have to claim additional compensation for such costs, beyond that provided by the ongoing payments made to the state annually pursuant to the terms of the settlement agreement. A hearing on this motion was held on September 29, 2005. On December 20, 2005, the court ruled that the health impact fee violates the terms of the settlement and is unconstitutional. On December 28, 2005, the state noticed an appeal of the courts ruling and separately sought accelerated review of the trial courts order by the Minnesota Supreme Court. On January 18, 2006, the parties entered an agreed stipulation that permitted the state to continue to collect the health impact fee during the pendency of all relevant appeals. On January 19, 2006 the Minnesota Supreme Court agreed to hear the matter on an expedited basis. The Minnesota Supreme Court indicated that the case will be placed on its April 2006 calendar for oral argument. Separately, a class action complaint was filed on January 23, 2006 in the Fourth Judicial District of Minnesota State Court on behalf of consumers of cigarettes and other tobacco products in the State of Minnesota from August 1, 2005 to the present. The class action complaint names RJR Tobacco and various other entities as defendants, and asserts an unjust enrichment claim, seeks the imposition of a constructive trust with respect to the monies collected pursuant to the health impact fee, and requests that these monies be distributed by the best means practicable to the Class members. The plaintiffs in this action have agreed to have this case transferred to the court presiding over RJR Tobaccos Motion to Enforce the Settlement Agreement and to have the matter dealt with on a consolidated basis. In 1964, the Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service concluded that cigarette smoking was a health hazard of sufficient importance to warrant appropriate remedial action. Since 1966, federal law has required a warning statement on cigarette packaging. Since 1971, television and radio advertising of cigarettes has been prohibited in the United States. Cigarette advertising in other media in the United States is required to include information with respect to the tar and nicotine yield of cigarettes, as well as a warning statement. 85 Table of Contents During the past four decades, various laws affecting the cigarette industry have been enacted. In 1984, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act. Among other things, this act: establishes an interagency committee on smoking and health that is charged with carrying out a program to inform the public of any dangers to human health presented by cigarette smoking; requires a series of four health warnings to be printed on cigarette packages and advertising on a rotating basis; increases type size and area of the warning required in cigarette advertisements; and requires that cigarette manufacturers provide annually, on a confidential basis, a list of ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The warnings currently required on cigarette packages and advertisements are: SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease, Emphysema, And May Complicate Pregnancy; SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Quitting Smoking Now Greatly Reduces Serious Risks To Your Health; SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Smoking By Pregnant Women May Result in Fetal Injury, Premature Birth, and Low Birth Weight; and SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon Monoxide. Since the initial report in 1964, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (now the Secretary of Health and Human Services) and the Surgeon General have issued a number of other reports which purport to find the nicotine in cigarettes addictive and to link cigarette smoking and exposure to cigarette smoke with certain health hazards, including various types of cancer, coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive lung disease. These reports have recommended various governmental measures to reduce the incidence of smoking. In 1992, the federal Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Act was signed into law. This act requires states to adopt a minimum age of 18 for purchases of tobacco products and to establish a system to monitor, report and reduce the illegal sale of tobacco products to minors in order to continue receiving federal funding for mental health and drug abuse programs. In January 1996, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced regulations implementing this legislation. Legislation imposing various restrictions on public smoking also has been enacted in 49 states and many local jurisdictions, and many employers have initiated programs restricting or eliminating smoking in the workplace. A number of states have enacted legislation designating a portion of increased cigarette excise taxes to fund either anti smoking programs, health care programs or cancer research. In addition, educational and research programs addressing health care issues related to smoking are being funded from industry payments made or to be made under settlements with state attorneys general. Federal law prohibits smoking in scheduled passenger aircraft, and the U.S. Interstate Commerce Commission has banned smoking on buses transporting passengers interstate. Certain common carriers have imposed additional restrictions on passenger smoking. In December 2003, the California Environmental Protection Agency Air Resources Board issued a Proposed Identification of Environmental Tobacco Smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant for public review. On January 26, 2006, the Air Resources Board identified environmental tobacco smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant, following a three year administrative process. The Air Resources Board is now required to prepare a report assessing the need and appropriate degree of control of environmental tobacco smoke. RJR Tobacco cannot predict the form any future California regulation may take. Several states have enacted or have proposed legislation or regulations that would require cigarette manufacturers to disclose the ingredients used in the manufacture of cigarettes. In September 2003, the Massachusetts Department of Public Health, referred to as the MDPH, announced its intention to hold public hearings on amendments to its tobacco regulations. The proposed regulations would delete any ingredients 86 Table of Contents reporting requirement. (The United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit previously affirmed a ruling that the Massachusetts ingredient reporting law was unconstitutional.) MDPH also has proposed to inaugurate extensive changes to its regulations requiring tobacco companies to report nicotine yield ratings for cigarettes according to methods prescribed by MDPH. Because MDPH withdrew its notice for a public hearing in November 2003, it is impossible to predict the final form any new regulations will take or the effect they will have on the business or results of operations of RJR Tobacco. In June 2000, the New York state legislature passed legislation charging the states Office of Fire Prevention and Control with developing standards for fire safe or self extinguishing cigarettes. On December 31, 2003, OFPC issued a final standard with accompanying regulations that requires all cigarettes offered for sale in New York State after June 28, 2004, to achieve specified test results when placed on ten layers of filter paper in controlled laboratory conditions. The cigarettes that RAIs operating companies sell in New York State comply with this standard. In 2005, California and Vermont each enacted fire safe legislation of its own, adopting the same testing standard set forth in the OFPC regulations described above. This requirement will take effect in Vermont on May 1, 2006, and in California on January 1, 2007. Similar legislation is being considered in a number of other states. Varying standards from state to state could have an adverse effect on the business or results of operations of RJR Tobacco. A price differential exists between cigarettes manufactured for sale abroad and cigarettes manufactured for U.S. sale. Consequently, a domestic gray market has developed in cigarettes manufactured for sale abroad, but instead diverted for domestic sales that compete with cigarettes that RJR Tobacco manufactures for domestic sale. The U.S. federal government and all states, except Massachusetts, have enacted legislation prohibiting the sale and distribution of gray market cigarettes. In addition, RJR Tobacco has taken legal action against certain distributors and retailers who engage in such practices. RJR Tobacco expects to benefit from certain state legislative activity aimed at leveling the playing field between original participating manufacturers under the MSA and nonparticipating manufacturers under the MSA, referred to as NPMs. Forty six states have passed legislation to ensure NPMs are making required escrow payments. Under this legislation, a state would only permit distribution of brands by manufacturers who are deemed by the states to be MSA compliant. Failure to make escrow payments could result in the loss of an NPMs ability to sell tobacco products in a respective state. Early efforts to enact legislation, from 2001 to early 2002, resulted in a range of NPM laws, some containing only minimal requirements. However, once the National Association of Attorneys General, referred to as NAAG, became involved in the legislative initiative, model complementary NPM language was developed and introduced in the states where either no NPM laws existed or where existing laws needed to be amended to bring them in line with the model language. Additionally, 44 states have enacted legislation that closes a loophole in the MSA. The loophole allows NPMs that concentrate their sales in a single state, or a limited number of states, to recover most of the funds from their escrow accounts. To obtain the refunds, the manufacturers must establish that their escrow deposit was greater than the amount the state would have received had the manufacturer been a subsequent participating manufacturer under the MSA (i.e., the states allocable share). NAAG has endorsed adoption of the allocable share legislation needed to eliminate this loophole. Following a challenge by NPMs, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York has issued an order enjoining New York from enforcing allocable share legislation. It is possible that NPMs will challenge allocable share legislation passed in other states. Finally, four states, Alaska, Michigan, Minnesota and Utah, have enacted equity assessments on NPMs products. This legislative initiative has not been endorsed by NAAG, and one NPM has filed a challenge to the equity assessment in Michigan. Thirty three states by statute or court rule have limited, and several additional states are considering limiting, the amount of the bonds required to file an appeal of an adverse judgment in state court. The limitation on the amount of such bonds generally ranges from $25 million to $150 million. Such bonding statutes allow defendants that are subject to large adverse judgments, such as cigarette manufacturers, to 87 Table of Contents reasonably bond such judgments and pursue the appellate process. In six other jurisdictions, the filing of a notice of appeal automatically stays the judgment of the trial court. On May 21, 2003, the World Health Organization adopted a broad tobacco control treaty. The treaty recommends and requires enactment of legislation establishing specific actions to prevent youth smoking, restrict and gradually eliminate tobacco products marketing, provide greater regulation and disclosure of ingredients, increase the size and scope of package warning labels to cover at least 30% of each package and include graphic pictures on packages. The treaty entered into force on February 27, 2005 90 days after ratification by the 40th country. Within a year of entering into force, a subsidiary body, the Conference of the Parties, will begin meeting to review national reports, provide further guidance on proper implementation of the treaty, initiate protocol negotiations and promote the mobilization of financial resources. Although the U.S. delegate to the World Health Organization voted for the treaty in May 2003, and the Secretary for Health and Human Services signed the document in May 2004, it is not known whether the treaty will be sent to the U.S. Senate for ratification. Ratification of the treaty by the United States could lead to broader regulation of the industry. It is not possible to determine what additional federal, state or local legislation or regulations relating to smoking or cigarettes will be enacted or to predict the effect of new legislation or regulations on RJR Tobacco or the cigarette industry in general, but any new legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on RJR Tobacco or the cigarette industry in general. Tobacco Buyout Legislation On October 22, 2004, the President signed FETRA, eliminating the U.S. governments tobacco production controls and price support program. The buyout of tobacco quota holders provided for in FETRA is funded by a direct quarterly assessment on every tobacco product manufacturer and importer, on a market share basis measured on volume to which federal excise tax is applied. The aggregate cost of the buyout to the industry is approximately $9.9 billion, including approximately $9.6 billion payable to quota tobacco holders and growers through industry assessments over ten years and approximately $290 million for the liquidation of quota tobacco stock. As a result of the tobacco buyout legislation, the MSA Phase II obligations established in 1999 will be continued as scheduled through the end of 2010, but will be offset against the tobacco quota buyout obligations. RAIs operating subsidiaries annual expense under FETRA, excluding the tobacco stock liquidation assessment, is estimated to be approximately $260 million. RAIs operating subsidiaries incurred $81 million in 2005 related to assessments from quota tobacco stock liquidation. Of these amounts, approximately $25 million has been paid through the fourth quarter of 2005, and the remaining amount is scheduled to be paid, quarterly, by December 31, 2006. Remaining contingent liabilities for liquidation of quota tobacco stock, if any, will be recorded when an assessment is made. RAIs operating subsidiaries will record the FETRA assessment on a quarterly basis upon required notification of assessments. RAIs operating subsidiaries estimate that their overall share of the buyout will approximate $2.4 billion to $2.9 billion prior to the deduction of permitted offsets under the MSA. In addition, future market pricing could impact the carrying value of inventory, and adversely affect RJR Tobaccos financial condition and results of operations. Of the accrued but unpaid MSA Phase II obligations, $69 million was reversed in the fourth quarter of 2004, and $79 million was reversed in the first six months of 2005. On December 23, 2004, the North Carolina Business Court held that RJR Tobacco was entitled to a refund of its first three quarterly MSA Phase II payments made for 2004 of approximately $111 million, and was not obligated to make its fourth quarter payment of approximately $37 million. On August 19, 2005, the North Carolina Supreme Court reversed the lower courts decision, and remanded the case back to the North Carolina Business Court, where the MSA Phase II payments of approximately $111 million previously made for 2004 were released to the beneficiaries of the Growers Trust. On October 19, 2005, the North Carolina Business Court denied RJR Tobaccos motion for additional proceedings on the issue of the payment of the fourth quarter MSA Phase II payment of approximately $37 million, ordered RJR Tobacco to make this payment within ten business days and ordered RJR Tobacco to pay pre judgment interest. Pursuant to that order and an agreement with the trustee of the Growers Trust, RJR Tobacco paid, in the fourth quarter 88 Table of Contents of 2005, an aggregate of approximately $38 million in satisfaction of its fourth quarter 2004 MSA Phase II payments. For information concerning indemnification obligations between RJR Tobacco and B&W related to pre closing MSA liabilities, see Other Contingencies and Guarantees in note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Environmental Matters RAI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances. Such laws and regulations provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, third parties may make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances. In the past, RJR Tobacco has been named a potentially responsible party, referred to as a PRP, with third parties under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, referred to as CERCLA, with respect to several superfund sites. RAI and its subsidiaries are not aware of any current environmental matters that are expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of RAI or its subsidiaries. Regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, referred to as EPA, and other governmental agencies under various statutes have resulted in, and likely will continue to result in, substantial expenditures for pollution control, waste treatment, plant modification and similar activities. RAI and its subsidiaries are engaged in a continuing program to comply with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, and dependent upon the probability of occurrence and reasonable estimation of cost, accrue or disclose any material liability. Although it is difficult to reasonably estimate the portion of capital expenditures or other costs attributable to compliance with environmental laws and regulations, RAI does not expect such expenditures or other costs to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of RAI or its subsidiaries. Other Contingencies and Guarantees For information relating to other contingencies and guarantees of RAI, RJR and RJR Tobacco, see Other Contingencies and Guarantees in note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Cautionary Information Regarding Forward Looking Statements Statements included in this report that are not historical in nature are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements regarding RAIs future performance and financial results inherently are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties, described in the forward looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include: the substantial and increasing regulation and taxation of the cigarette industry; various legal actions, proceedings and claims relating to the sale, distribution, manufacture, development, advertising, marketing and claimed health effects of cigarettes that are pending or may be instituted against RAI or its subsidiaries; the substantial payment obligations and limitations on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes under the MSA and other state settlement agreements; the continuing decline in volume in the domestic cigarette industry; competition from other cigarette manufacturers, including increased promotional activities and the growth of deep discount brands; the success or failure of new product innovations and acquisitions; 89 Table of Contents the responsiveness of both the trade and consumers to new products, marketing strategies and promotional programs; the ability to realize the benefits and synergies arising from the combination of RJR Tobacco and the U.S. cigarette and tobacco business of B&W; the ability to achieve efficiencies in manufacturing and distribution operations without negatively affecting sales; the cost of tobacco leaf and other raw materials and other commodities used in products, including future market pricing of tobacco leaf which could adversely impact inventory valuations; the effect of market conditions on foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and the return on corporate cash; the effect of market conditions on the performance of pension assets or any adverse effects of any new legislation or regulations changing pension expense accounting or required pension funding levels; the rating of RJRs securities; the restrictive covenants of RJRs revolving credit facility; the possibility of fire, violent weather and other disasters that may adversely affect the manufacturing facilities; any adverse effects from the transition of the packaging operations formerly conducted by RJR Packaging, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of RJR Tobacco, to the buyers of RJR Packaging, LLCs businesses; any adverse effects arising out of the implementation of an SAP enterprise business system in 2006; and the potential existence of significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal controls over financial reporting that may be identified during the performance of testing required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Due to these uncertainties and risks, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Except as provided by federal securities laws, RAI is not required to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Item 7a. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. RAI and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to their normal investing and funding activities. In addition, RAI and its subsidiaries have exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk concerning obligations for, and service agreements related to, foreign operations denominated in euros and British pounds. RAI and its subsidiaries have established policies and procedures to manage their exposure to market risks and use major institutions that are creditworthy to minimize their investment and credit risk. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes. See note 13 to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding financial instruments entered into by RAI or its operating subsidiaries. The value at risk model is used to statistically measure the maximum fair value, cash flows and earnings loss over one year from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates. The computation assumes a 95% confidence level under normal market conditions. The actual observed correlation method is used for aggregating value at risk amounts across market risk exposure categories. This model indicates that near term changes in interest rates and foreign currency rates will not have a material impact on the future earnings, fair values or cash flows, based on the historical movements in interest rates, foreign currency rates and the fair value of market rate sensitive instruments at December 31, 2005. 90 Table of Contents
