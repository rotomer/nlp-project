Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following is a discussion and analysis of RAIs business, initiatives, critical accounting policies and its consolidated results of operations and financial condition. Following the overview and discussion of business initiatives, the critical accounting policies disclose certain accounting policies that are material to RAIs results of operations and financial condition for the periods presented in this report. The discussion and analysis of RAIs results of operations is presented in two comparative sections, 2006 compared with 2005, and 2005 compared with 2004. Disclosures related to liquidity and financial condition complete managements discussion and analysis. You should read this discussion and analysis of RAIs consolidated financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, and for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2006. Overview and Business Initiatives RAIs operating subsidiaries include RJR Tobacco, Conwood, Santa Fe, Lane and GPI. RAIs largest reportable operating segment, RJR Tobacco, is the second largest cigarette manufacturer in the United States. RJR Tobaccos largest selling cigarette brands, CAMEL, KOOL, DORAL, WINSTON and SALEM, are currently five of the ten best selling brands of cigarettes in the United States. Those brands, and its other brands, including PALL MALL, MISTY and CAPRI, are manufactured in a variety of styles and marketed in the United States to meet a range of adult smoker preferences. RJR Tobacco also manages a contract manufacturing business through arrangements with BAT affiliates. RAIs other reportable operating segment, Conwood, is the second largest smokeless tobacco products manufacturer in the United States. RAI acquired Conwood on May 31, 2006. Conwoods primary brands include its largest selling moist snuff brands, GRIZZLY and KODIAK, two of the six best selling brands of moist snuff in the United States, and LEVI GARRETT, a loose leaf brand. Conwoods other products include dry snuff, plug and twist tobacco products. All of Conwoods products held the first or second position in market share in their respective categories in 2006. The disclosures classified as All Other include the total assets and results of operations of Santa Fe, Lane and GPI. Santa Fe manufactures and markets cigarettes and other tobacco products under the NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand. Santa Fe markets its products primarily in the United States, and has a small, but growing, international tobacco business. Lane manufactures or distributes cigars, roll your own, cigarette and pipe tobacco brands, including DUNHILL and CAPTAIN BLACK tobacco products. GPI manufactures and exports cigarettes to U.S. territories, U.S. duty free shops and U.S. overseas military bases, and manages a contract manufacturing business. Beginning on January 1, 2007, Conwood will distribute certain of Lanes non cigarette products, and RJR Tobacco will distribute DUNHILL cigarettes. Also, beginning on January 1, 2007, GPI will manage Santa Fes international business. RJR Tobacco RJR Tobacco primarily conducts business in the highly competitive U.S. cigarette market with a few large manufacturers and many smaller participants. The U.S. cigarette market is believed to be a mature market, and overall consumer demand is expected to continue to decline. Trade inventory adjustments may result in short term changes in demand for its products if, and when, wholesale and retail tobacco distributors adjust the timing of their 67 Table of Contents purchases of product to manage their inventory levels. RJR Tobacco believes it is not appropriate for it to speculate on other external factors that may impact the purchasing decisions of the wholesale and retail tobacco distributors. Competition is based primarily on brand positioning and price, as well as product attributes and packaging, consumer loyalty, promotions, advertising and retail presence. Cigarette brands produced by the major manufacturers generally require competitive pricing, substantial marketing support, retail programs and other incentives to maintain or improve a brands market position or to introduce a new brand. RJR Tobacco is committed to building and maintaining a portfolio of profitable brands. RJR Tobaccos marketing programs are designed to strengthen brand image, build brand awareness and loyalty and switch adult smokers of competing brands. In addition to building strong brand equity, RJR Tobaccos marketing approach utilizes a retail pricing strategy, including discounting at retail, to defend certain brands shares of market against competitive pricing pressure. Competitive discounting has increased significantly over time as a result of higher state excise taxes and the strength of deep discount brands. Deep discount brands are brands marketed by manufacturers that are not original participants in the MSA, and accordingly, do not have cost structures burdened with MSA payments to the same extent as the original participating manufacturers. RJR Tobaccos brand portfolio strategy during 2005 and 2006 included three categories of brands: investment, selective support and non support. The investment brands were CAMEL and KOOL, which received significant resources focused on accelerating their share of market growth. The selective support brands included two premium brands, WINSTON and SALEM, and two value brands, DORAL and PALL MALL, all of which received limited support in an effort to optimize profitability. The non support brands were managed to maximize near term profitability. At the beginning of 2007, RJR Tobacco further refined its brand portfolio strategy and modified the three categories of brands to growth, support and non support. The growth brands include two premium brands, CAMEL and KOOL, and a value brand, PALL MALL. Although all of these brands are managed for long term accelerated growth and profit, CAMEL and KOOL will continue to receive significant investment support, consistent with their previous investment brand status. The support brands include three premium brands, WINSTON, SALEM and CAPRI, and two value brands, DORAL and MISTY, all of which receive limited support for scale and long term profit. The non support brands include all remaining brands and are managed to maximize near term profitability. RJR Tobacco expects that, within the next four years, this focused portfolio strategy will result in growth in total RJR Tobacco share, as gains on growth brands more than offset declines among other brands. Conwood On May 31, 2006, RAI, through its newly formed subsidiary, Conwood Holdings, Inc., completed its $3.5 billion acquisition of 100% of the capital stock of a newly formed holding company owning Conwood Company, L.P., Conwood Sales Co., L.P., Rosswil LLC, Scott Tobacco LLC, Conwood LLC, Conwood 1 LLC and Conwood 2 LLC. Conwood is engaged in the business of developing, manufacturing and marketing smokeless tobacco products. Conwoods headquarters and primary manufacturing facility are located in Memphis, Tennessee. The Conwood acquisition was funded by RAI borrowings, new debt RAI securities and available cash. See Liquidity below for additional information relating to borrowing arrangements and long term debt. The transaction was treated as a purchase of the Conwood net assets by RAI for financial accounting purposes. RAI believes the Conwood acquisition will enhance shareholder value and will continue to be accretive to operating earnings. The Conwood acquisition also is expected to enhance RAIs efforts to offer a range of differentiated tobacco products to adult consumers. RAI intends to combine certain operations of Lane with Conwood, to be completed by the end of 2007, in order to consolidate and strengthen the companies portfolio of smokeless tobacco products and other non cigarette tobacco products. Conwood is the only company with brands in every category of the smokeless tobacco market, including moist snuff, loose leaf, dry snuff, plug and twist tobacco. Conwoods moist snuff products accounted for approximately 75% of its total net sales in 2006. In contrast to the declining U.S. cigarette market, U.S. moist snuff volumes have grown at an average rate of approximately 4% per year over the last four years with an accelerated growth of price value brands. Also, the profit 68 Table of Contents margins on moist snuff are significantly higher than in the cigarette industry. Moist snuffs growth is partially attributable to cigarette smokers switching from cigarettes to smokeless tobacco products or using both. Within the moist snuff category, premium brands have lost market share to price value brands, led by GRIZZLY, in recent years. Conwoods U.S. moist snuff market share was 25.15% for the year ended December 31, 2006, based on distributor reported data processed by MSAi, for distributor shipments to retail. Conwood has more than doubled its total share in the past six years. Conwoods continued growth is attributable to its innovation, product development and brand building, including the launch of the GRIZZLY moist snuff brand in 2001 which, for 2006, had a 19.45% market share. Conwood faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco categories. Similar to the cigarette market, competition is based primarily on brand positioning and price, as well as product attributes and packaging, consumer loyalty, promotions, advertising and retail presence. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates GAAP requires estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the reported amounts in RAIs consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Some of these estimates require difficult, subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and as a result, actual results could differ from those estimates. Due to the estimation processes involved, the following summarized accounting policies and their application are considered to be critical to understanding the business operations, financial condition and results of operations of RAI and its subsidiaries. For information related to these and other significant accounting policies, see note 1 to consolidated financial statements. Purchase Accounting RAI accounts for business combination transactions in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141, Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141 requires that RAI allocate the cost of the acquisition to assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on their fair values as of the acquisition date. Estimates of fair values for property, plant and equipment, trademarks and other identifiable intangibles generally are based on independent appraisals; pension and postretirement obligations are based on actuarial studies; and other accounts are based on managements best estimates using assumptions that are believed to be reasonable. In addition, depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of trademarks and other intangibles with finite lives, are directly related to estimated fair values and estimated useful lives determined as of the acquisition date. The determination of fair values involves considerable estimation and judgment. Among other things, it requires developing forecasts of cash flows and discount rates for trademarks and other intangibles; selecting appropriate valuation bases and methodologies for property, plant and equipment; determining appropriate actuarial assumptions for pensions and postretirement plans; and determining the number and timing of employees to be terminated or relocated and the associated costs. The value of goodwill and trademarks and other intangibles with indefinite lives will be subjected to annual impairment testing that could result in future impairment charges. Changes in the useful lives of property, plant and equipment, trademarks or other intangibles could impact depreciation or, in certain situations, impairment charges. Tobacco Related Litigation RAI discloses information concerning tobacco related litigation for which an unfavorable outcome is more than remote. RAI and its subsidiaries record their legal expenses and other litigation costs and related administrative costs as selling, general and administrative expenses as those costs are incurred. RAI and its subsidiaries will record any loss related to tobacco litigation at such time as an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate is a range, the recorded loss will be the best estimate within the range. If no amount in the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount of the range will be recorded. As discussed in note 14 to consolidated financial statements, RJR Tobacco, Conwood and their affiliates, including RAI, and indemnitees, have been named in a number of tobacco related legal actions, proceedings or 69 Table of Contents claims seeking damages in amounts ranging into the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. Unfavorable judgments awarding compensatory damages, punitive damages and or fines have been returned against RJR Tobacco in the Engle case, the Scott class action case, a small number of individual smoking and health cases, a Broin II flight attendant ETS case and a California state law enforcement action. The July 2000 Engle punitive damages verdict was reversed by the intermediate appellate court on May 21, 2003, and the reversal was upheld by the Florida Supreme Court on July 6, 2006. RJR Tobacco has paid approximately $18 million since January 1, 2003, related to unfavorable smoking and health judgments, including pre acquisition contingencies related to the B&W business combination. RAI and its subsidiaries believe, however, that they have valid bases for appeals in their pending cases, and believe they have a number of valid defenses to all actions and intend to defend all actions vigorously. RAIs management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees, including B&W, or the loss of any particular claim concerning the use of smokeless tobacco against Conwood, when viewed on an individual basis, is not probable or estimable. RJR Tobacco recorded less than $1 million related to the judgment in the Thompson v. B&W individual case in the fourth quarter of 2006, to be paid in 2007. No other liability for smoking and health tobacco litigation or smokeless tobacco litigation was recorded in RAIs consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2006. As discussed in more detail in note 14 to consolidated financial statements, RJR has liabilities totaling $94 million that were recorded in 1999 in connection with certain indemnification claims, not related to smoking and health, asserted by JTI against RJR and RJR Tobacco, relating to the activities of Northern Brands and related litigation. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and it is possible that some of the tobacco related legal actions, proceedings or claims could ultimately be decided against RJR Tobacco, Conwood or their affiliates, including RAI, and indemnitees. Any unfavorable outcome of such actions could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of RAI or its subsidiaries. Settlement Agreements As discussed in Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry in note 14 to consolidated financial statements, RJR Tobacco, Santa Fe and Lane are participants in the MSA, and RJR Tobacco is a participant in other state settlement agreements related to governmental health care cost recovery actions. Their obligations and the related expense charges under the MSA and other state settlement agreements are subject to adjustments based upon, among other things, the volume of cigarettes sold by the operating subsidiaries, their relative market share and inflation. Since relative market share is based on cigarette shipments, the best estimate of the allocation of charges under these agreements is recorded in cost of products sold as the products are shipped. Adjustments to these estimates, which historically have not been significant, are recorded in the period that the change becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Conwood is not a participant in the MSA. For more information related to historical and expected settlement expenses and payments under the MSA and other state settlement agreements, see Governmental Health Care Cost Recovery Cases MSA and Other State Settlement Agreements in note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Intangible Assets Intangible assets include goodwill, trademarks and other intangibles and are accounted for under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. See note 1 to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment charges in connection with RAIs ongoing application of SFAS No. 142. RAI generally engages an independent appraisal firm to assist it in determining the fair value of its reporting units and trademarks with indefinite lives annually in the fourth quarter. The determination of fair value involves considerable estimates and judgment. In particular, the fair value of a reporting unit involves, among other things, developing forecasts of future cash flows, determining an appropriate discount rate, and when goodwill impairment is implied, determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities, including unrecorded intangibles. Although RAI believes it has based its impairment testing and impairment charges on reasonable estimates and assumptions, the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different results. Generally, if the current competitive environment worsens or RAIs operating companies strategic initiatives adversely affect 70 Table of Contents their financial performance, the fair value of goodwill, trademarks and other intangibles could be impaired in future periods. Pension and Postretirement Benefits RAI and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor a number of non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering most of their employees, and also provide certain health and life insurance benefits for most of their retired employees and their dependents. These benefits are generally no longer provided to employees hired on or after January 1, 2004. For additional information relating to pension and postretirement benefits, see note 17 to consolidated financial statements. As part of the Conwood acquisition, RAI assumed certain pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related assets of Conwoods plans. The liability for the projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets was recorded in accordance with SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions and SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. All previously existing unrecognized net gain or loss, unrecognized prior service cost, or unrecognized transition obligation or asset existing at the date of the Conwood acquisition were eliminated. As a result of the Conwood acquisition, RAIs pension benefit obligation and pension assets increased by $45 million and $35 million, respectively, and the postretirement benefit obligation increased by $37 million. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R), which became effective for RAI at December 31, 2006. SFAS No. 158 requires balance sheet recognition of the net asset or liability for the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans, on a plan by plan basis, and recognition of changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur. The adoption of SFAS No. 158 had no effect on RAIs net income or cash flow. Pension expense is determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, and SFAS No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits. Postretirement benefit expense is determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. Because pension and other postretirement obligations will ultimately be settled in future periods, the determination of annual expense and liabilities is subject to estimates and assumptions. With the assistance of independent actuarial and investment management firms, RAI reviews these assumptions annually based on historic experience and expected future trends or coincidentally with a major event and modifies them as needed. Demographic assumptions such as termination of employment, mortality or retirement are reviewed periodically as expectations change. Gains or losses are annual changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions. The minimum amortization of unrecognized gains or losses, as described in SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, is included in pension expense. Prior service costs, which are changes in benefit obligations due to plan amendments, are amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period for active employees. The market related value of plan assets excludes deferred asset gains of $311 million and recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years. If the market value of assets had been used to determine pension expense, the impact would have been a decrease to the 2006 costs of $45 million. Approximately $27 million is attributable to the expected return on asset component of expense and $18 million is due to the gain/loss amortization component. The minimum amortization of unrecognized gains or losses, as described in SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, is also included in the postretirement benefit expense. Prior service costs, which are changes in benefit obligations due to plan amendments, are amortized on a straight line basis over the service to expected full eligibility age for active employees, or average remaining life expectancies for inactive employees if most of the plan obligations are due to inactive employees. The market related value of plan assets excludes deferred asset losses of $20 million and recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over five years. If the market value of assets had been used to determine 71 Table of Contents postretirement benefit expense, the impact would have been an increase to the 2006 costs of $2 million, all attributable to the expected return on asset component of expense. The most critical assumptions and their sensitivity to change are presented below: Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits 2006 2005 2006 2005 Weighted average assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at December 31: Discount rate 6.10 % 5.90 % 6.10 % 5.90 % Rate of compensation increase 4.98 % 4.97 % 5.00 % 5.00 % Pension Benefits Postretirement Benefits 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Weighted average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for years ended December 31: Discount rate 5.90 % 6.05%;5.70 %(1) 6.15%;6.27 %(2) 5.91% 6.05%;5.70%;5.75% (3) 6.15%;6.45 %(4) Expected long term return on plan assets 8.74 % 8.79 % 8.79 % 8.00% 8.50% 8.50 % Rate of compensation increase 4.98 % 4.97 % 4.77 % 5.00% 5.00% 4.79 % (1) The January 1, 2005 overall beginning discount rate of 6.05% was changed to 5.70% for the period from April 30, 2005 to December 31, 2005, for plans impacted by the sale of RJR Tobaccos packaging operations. (2) A discount rate of 6.15% was used for the period from January 1, 2004 to July 31, 2004, and a weighted average discount rate of 6.27% was used for the period from August 1, 2004 to December 31, 2004, to reflect the impact of the B&W business combination. (3) The January 1, 2005 overall beginning discount rate of 6.05% was changed for the pre combination RJR Tobacco benefit plans only, to a discount rate of 5.70% for the period April 30, 2005 to September 15, 2005, and a discount rate of 5.75% was used for the period from September 16, 2005 to December 31, 2005. (4) A discount rate of 6.15% was used for the period from January 1, 2004 to July 31, 2004, and a weighted average discount rate of 6.45% was used for the period from August 1, 2004 to December 31, 2004, to reflect the impact of the B&W business combination. RAI generally uses a hypothetical bond matching analysis to determine the discount rate. The overall expected long term rate of return on assets assumptions for pension and postretirement assets are based on: (1) the target asset allocation for plan assets, (2) long term capital markets forecasts for asset classes employed and (3) excess return expectations of active management to the extent asset classes are actively managed. 72 Table of Contents Assumption Sensitivity: Assumed asset return and discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the benefit plans. A one percentage point change in assumed discount rate for the pension plans and other postretirement plans would have had the following effects: 1 Percentage Point Increase 1 Percentage Point Decrease Pensions Postretirement Pensions Postretirement Plans Plans Plans Plans Effect on 2006 net periodic benefit cost $ (18 ) $ (5 ) $ 19 $ 2 Effect on December 31, 2006, projected benefit obligation and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (554 ) (141 ) 622 156 A one percentage point change in assumed asset return would have had the following effects: 1 Percentage Point Increase 1 Percentage Point Decrease Pensions Postretirement Pensions Postretirement Plans Plans Plans Plans Effect on 2006 net periodic benefit cost $ (42 ) $ (4 ) $ 42 $ 4 During 2005, pension plan assets increased $238 million, as a result of the favorable 2005 equity market performance and employer contributions, partially offset by benefit payments. Pension benefit obligations increased by $161 million due to a decline in discount rates, partially offset by benefit payments and the sale of RJR Tobaccos packaging operations in May 2005. At December 31, 2005, the pension benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $879 million. During 2006, pension plan assets increased $641 million, primarily as a result of the favorable 2006 equity market performance and employer contributions, partially offset by benefit payments. Pension benefit obligations decreased by $55 million primarily due to the increase in discount rate from 5.90% to 6.10%, net of the amounts assumed in the Conwood acquisition. At December 31, 2006, the pension benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $183 million. Beginning in 2006, RAI adjusted its expected long term rate of return on pension assets to 8.75% for its major plans, from 9.00% and 8.50% in 2005. During 2005, postretirement plan assets increased $15 million, as a result of favorable 2005 equity market performance and employer contributions, partially offset by benefit payments. Postretirement benefit obligations increased by $97 million due to a decline in discount rates, partially offset by benefit payments. At December 31, 2005, the postretirement benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $1.2 billion. During 2006, postretirement plan assets increased $24 million, as a result of favorable 2006 equity market performance and employer contributions, partially offset by benefit payments. Postretirement benefit obligations decreased by $26 million due to an increase in discount rates, net of the amounts assumed in the Conwood acquisition. At December 31, 2006, the postretirement benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $1.1 billion. In 2005, RAI implemented a cap on how much it will pay for medical and dental coverage for retirees as a group, excluding pre 1993 retirees and former B&W retirees. The cap was raised above previous amounts creating an unrecognized prior service cost of $57 million. In 2006, RAI introduced new retiree medical options and cost sharing for certain retirees creating a prior service credit of $3 million. The prior service cost will be amortized over the number of years, on average, it takes for employees to be fully eligible for benefits. Pension expense in 2007 is expected to be within a range of $15 million expense to $15 million income, compared with expense of $54 million in 2006, primarily due to increased asset returns and employer contributions. Postretirement benefit expense in 2007 is expected to be within a range of $65 million to $75 million, compared with expense of $72 million in 2006. 73 Table of Contents The amount by which the pension and postretirement benefit obligations exceed the fair value of the plan assets could increase to the extent of a decline in the fair value of plan assets, as well as adverse changes in actuarial assumptions, including a reduction in the discount rate used to calculate the benefit obligations. RAI expects to contribute approximately $300 million to its pension plans in 2007, of which $289 million was contributed in January 2007. Additional cash funding may be made in the future. RAI expects payments related to its postretirement plans to be $75 million in 2007. Differences between actual results and actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods. In recent years, actual results have varied significantly from actuarial assumptions. In particular, pension and postretirement liabilities have decreased as a result of the increase in the discount rate. These changes have resulted in a reduction in charges to comprehensive income. These changes are expected to result in a reduction in pension and postretirement expense in future years. However, the Pension Protection Act passed into law in 2006 may require additional cash funding of the pension obligations in the future. The target pension asset allocation is 59% equity investments, which includes U.S. equity, non U.S. equity and global equity, 27% fixed income, 10% opportunistic investments, which includes hedge funds and global tactical asset allocation, and 4% alternative investments, which includes private equity investments and real estate, with a rebalancing range of approximately plus or minus 3% to 5% around the target asset allocations. The target postretirement asset allocation is 43% U.S. equity investments, including private equity investments, 17% non U.S. equity investments, 38% debt securities, 1% hedge fund investments and 1% real estate and other, with a rebalancing range of approximately plus or minus 5% around the target asset allocations. RAIs pension and postretirement plans weighted average asset allocations at December 31, 2006 and 2005, by asset category were as follows: Pension Plans 2006 2005 Asset Category: Equities 60 % 61 % Fixed income 25 % 26 % Opportunistic 11 % 9 % Alternative 4 % 4 % Total 100 % 100 % Postretirement Plans 2006 2005 Asset Category: U.S. equity securities 44 % 47 % Debt securities 35 % 24 % Non U.S. equity securities 19 % 18 % Hedge funds 1 % 5 % Real estate and other 1 % 6 % Total 100 % 100 % In late 2005, RAI announced an enhancement to its current qualified defined contribution plan beginning January 1, 2006. The amount of the retirement enhancement is based on a sliding scale by providing higher, additional contributions to certain employees closer to retirement with lower additional contributions for certain other employees. This enhanced program increased expense by approximately $20 million in 2006 compared with 2005. 74 Table of Contents Income Taxes Tax law requires certain items to be included in taxable income at different times than is required for book reporting purposes under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. These differences may be permanent or temporary in nature. To the extent a book and tax difference is permanent in nature, that is, the financial treatment differs permanently from the tax treatment under SFAS No. 109, the tax effect of this item is reflected in RAIs effective income tax rate. RAI determines its annual effective income tax rate based on forecasted pre tax book income and forecasted permanent book and tax differences. The rate is established at the beginning of the year and is evaluated on a quarterly basis. Any changes to the forecasted information or any resolution of an audit with taxing authorities may cause the effective rate to be adjusted. Any required adjustments are made on a prospective basis for the remaining quarters in the year. To the extent that any book and tax differences are temporary in nature, that is, the book realization will occur in a different period than the tax realization, a deferred tax asset or liability is established as required under SFAS No. 109. To the extent that a deferred tax asset is created, management evaluates RAIs ability to realize this asset. Management currently believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets recorded in RAIs consolidated balance sheets will be realized. To the extent a deferred tax liability is established under SFAS No. 109, it is recorded, tracked and, once it becomes currently due and payable, paid to the taxing authorities. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, the resolution of certain prior years tax matters resulted in reduction of income tax expense of $17 million, $78 million and $126 million, respectively. In 2005 and 2004, RAI recorded an adjustment to tax expense included in discontinued operations of $1 million and $6 million, respectively, related to the gain on the 1999 sale of RJRs international tobacco business. Including these adjustments, the net after tax gain on the sale of the international tobacco business was $2.5 billion. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, RAI recorded an adjustment of $74 million, $55 million and $49 million, respectively, to the gain related to the acquisition of RJRs former parent, NGH, which occurred in 2000, primarily reflecting the favorable resolution of associated tax matters. Including these adjustments, the net after tax gain on the acquisition of NGH was $1.8 billion. The financial statements reflect managements best estimate of RAIs current and deferred tax liabilities and assets. Future events, including but not limited to, additional resolutions with taxing authorities could have an impact on RAIs current estimate of tax liabilities, realization of tax assets and upon RAIs effective income tax rate. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but provides a definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for RAI as of January 1, 2008. RAI has not yet determined the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 157 on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In July 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, referred to as FIN No. 48. FIN No. 48 clarifies SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, by providing specific guidance for consistent reporting of uncertain income taxes recognized in a companys financial statements, including classification, interest and penalties and disclosures. FIN No. 48 is effective for RAI as of January 1, 2007. Based on preliminary analysis, RAI does not expect the implementation of FIN 48, during the first quarter of 2007, to have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits all entities to choose to elect to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value. SFAS No. 159 is effective for RAI as of January 1, 2008. RAI has not yet determined the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 159 on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 75 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2006 Compared with 2005 For the Twelve Months Ended December 31(1), 2006 2005 % Change Net sales:(2) RJR Tobacco $ 7,675 $ 7,695 (0.0 )% Conwood 291 NM(4 ) All other 544 561 (3.0 )% Net sales 8,510 8,256 3.1 % Cost of products sold(2),(3) 4,803 4,919 (2.4 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,658 1,611 2.9 % Amortization expense 28 41 (31.7 )% Loss on sale of assets 24 NM(4 ) Restructuring and asset impairment charges 1 2 (50.0 )% Goodwill and trademark impairment charges 90 200 (55.0 )% Operating income: RJR Tobacco 1,626 1,346 20.8 % Conwood 160 NM(4 ) All other 194 144 34.7 % Corporate expense (50 ) (31 ) (61.3 )% $ 1,930 $ 1,459 32.3 % (1) Conwoods net sales and operating income include results of operations for the months of June through December 2006, only.

(4) Percent change is not meaningful. RJR Tobacco Net Sales RJR Tobaccos net sales for the year ended 2006 decreased $20 million from the comparable prior year, primarily due to lower volumes of $268 million, offset in part by higher pricing resulting from a January 2006 price increase. RJR Tobaccos net sales are dependent upon its shipment volume in a declining market, premium versus value brand mix and list pricing, offset by promotional spending, trade incentives and federal excise taxes. 76 Table of Contents Domestic shipment volume, in billions of units for RJR Tobacco and the industry, were as follows(1): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, RJR Tobacco 2006 2005 % Change Growth brands: CAMEL excluding non filter 23.5 22.0 6.5 % KOOL 11.7 11.8 (0.4 )% PALL MALL Savings 6.4 5.8 10.5 % 41.6 39.6 5.1 % Support brands 44.1 46.6 (5.5 )% Non support brands 18.0 21.1 (14.6 )% Total domestic 103.7 107.4 (3.4 )% Total premium 63.8 64.8 (1.6 )% Total value 40.0 42.6 (6.1 )% Total domestic 103.7 107.4 (3.4 )% Industry(2) Premium 270.0 271.4 (0.5 )% Value 102.5 110.4 (7.2 )% Industry total domestic 372.5 381.7 (2.4 )% (1) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. (2) Based on information from MSAi. These amounts, including the restatement of prior periods, reflect MSAis revised methodology adopted to better estimate industry volume. RJR Tobaccos total domestic shipment volume decreased 3.4% in 2006 compared with 2005 due to declines in consumption, or retail sales to consumers, and one less shipping day. The overall cigarette industry decline was 2.4%. Shipments in the premium tier increased to 61.5% of RJR Tobaccos total domestic shipments during 2006 as compared with 60.4% in the prior year. The industrys premium shipments increased to 72.5% in 2006 from 71.1% in 2005. The shares of RJR Tobacco as a percentage of total share of U.S. retail cigarette sales according to data(1) from IRI, were as follows: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31,(2)(3) Share Point 2006 2005 Change Growth brands: CAMEL excluding non filter 7.42 % 6.74 % 0.68 KOOL 3.13 % 3.01 % 0.13 PALL MALL Savings 1.86 % 1.58 % 0.28 12.41 % 11.33 % 1.09 Support brands 12.12 % 12.82 % (0.70 ) Non support brands 5.25 % 6.14 % (0.89 ) RJR Tobacco total domestic 29.78 % 30.28 % (0.50 ) 77 Table of Contents (1) Retail share of U.S. cigarette sales data is included in this document because it is used by RJR Tobacco primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants and brands and market trends. You should not rely on the market share data reported by IRI as being a precise measurement of actual market share because IRI is not able to effectively track all volume. Moreover, you should be aware that in a product market experiencing overall declining consumption, a particular product can experience increasing market share relative to competing products, yet still be subject to declining consumption volumes. (2) These amounts, including the restatement of prior periods, reflect IRIs revised methodology adopted to better reflect industry dynamics. (3) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. In 2006 retail share of market of CAMELs filtered styles increased 0.68 share points from 2005. In the first quarter of 2006, CAMEL introduced new CAMEL Wides packaging and initiated efforts to enhance the performance of the brands menthol styles, including new packaging and introducing the CAMEL Wides Menthol style. Also in 2006, CAMEL introduced CAMEL SNUS, a smokeless, spitless tobacco product, in test markets. KOOL continues to maintain its appeal among adult menthol smokers and had an increase in its retail share of market of 0.13 share points in 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2006, KOOL introduced KOOL XL, a wide gauge cigarette style, which provides another tangible point of difference from competing brands. PALL MALL increased its share of market by 0.28 share points in 2006 and continues to demonstrate its strength in the value category based on its unique product platform of being a longer lasting cigarette. The combined share of market of RJR Tobaccos growth brands grew 1.09 share points during 2006. However, the decline in share of support and non support brands more than offset the gains on the growth brands. The share results for 2006 were in line with the RJR Tobaccos brand portfolio strategy, and the overall market share declines continue to moderate. RJR Tobaccos premium share position of 18.76% in 2006 increased 0.26 share points from 2005 due to the increase of its growth brands. RJR Tobaccos value share position of 11.02% of the market in 2006 declined 0.77 share points from 2005. Operating Income RJR Tobaccos operating income for 2006 increased to $1,626 million from $1,346 million in 2005 primarily due to favorable pricing, and lower trademark impairment charges, offset in part by lower volumes and higher MSA and tobacco quota buyout expenses, detailed below. In connection with the annual impairment testing of goodwill and certain intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2006, impairment occurred on four of RJR Tobaccos non growth brands, primarily DORAL and SALEM. The impairment primarily reflects modification, during the fourth quarter of 2006, to the previously anticipated level of support among certain brands, and also results from increased decline rate in projected net sales of certain brands, compared with that assumed in the 2005 annual impairment test, which resulted in $198 million of trademark impairment charges. In 2006, RJR Tobacco recorded impairment charges of $90 million based on the excess of certain brands carrying values over their fair values, determined with the assistance of an independent appraisal firm, using the present value of estimated future cash flows assuming a discount rate of 10.75%. The discount rate was determined by adjusting the RJR Tobacco enterprise discount rate by an appropriate risk premium to reflect an asset group risk. RJR Tobaccos operating income also was impacted by lower amortization expense of $13 million for the comparable periods, primarily due to certain acquired consumer related intangibles being fully amortized prior to 2006. For information relating to the 2003 and 2002 restructuring reserves, including the $1 million adjustment recorded in 2006, see note 4 to consolidated financial statements. 78 Table of Contents RJR Tobaccos cost of products sold includes the following components for MSA and other state settlements, and federal tobacco buyout expenses for the years ended December 31: 2006 2005 Settlement $ 2,589 $ 2,618 Phase II growers liability offset (79 ) Phase II growers liability expense 38 Total settlement expense $ 2,589 $ 2,577 Federal tobacco quota buyout $ 258 $ 259 Federal quota tobacco stock liquidation assessment (9 ) 79 Total quota buyout expense $ 249 $ 338 RJR Tobaccos MSA and other state settlement expenses are expected to be approximately $2.8 billion in 2007, subject to adjustment for changes in volume and other factors, and the federal tobacco quota buyout is expected to be in the range of $230 million to $280 million in 2007. For additional information, see Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Governmental Health Care Cost Recovery Cases MSA and Other State Settlement Agreements in note 14 to consolidated financial statements and Governmental Activity below. Merger and integration costs related to the B&W business combination decreased during 2006 compared with 2005, favorably impacting cost of products sold by $14 million and selling, general and administrative expenses by $60 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses for RJR Tobacco also were impacted by a $48 million decrease in product liability defense costs during 2006 compared with the prior year period, offset by $46 million of expenditures relating to ballot initiatives in 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs of litigating and administering product liability claims, as well as other legal expenses. During 2006 and 2005, RJR Tobaccos product liability defense costs were $105 million and $153 million, respectively. The decrease in product liability defense costs in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to reduced litigation activity, including a decrease in the number of cases tried or in trial during 2006 (2 cases) compared with 2005 (5 cases, including the U.S. Department of Justice case). Product liability cases generally include smoking and health related cases. In particular, these cases include the following categories of cases listed in the table set forth in Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Overview in note 14 to consolidated financial statements: Individual Smoking and Health; Flight Attendant ETS (Broin II); Class Actions; Governmental Health Care Cost Recovery; Other Health Care Cost Recovery and Aggregated Claims; and Asbestos Contribution. Product liability defense costs include the following items: direct and indirect compensation, fees and related costs and expenses for internal legal and related administrative staff administering product liability claims; fees and cost reimbursements paid to outside attorneys; direct and indirect payments to third party vendors for litigation support activities; expert witness costs and fees; and payments to fund legal defense costs for the now dissolved Council for Tobacco Research U.S.A. 79 Table of Contents Numerous factors affect the amount of product liability defense costs. The most important factors are the number of cases pending and the number of cases in trial or in preparation for trial (i.e., with active discovery and motions practice). See Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Overview in note 14 to consolidated financial statements for detailed information regarding the number and type of cases pending, and Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Scheduled Trials in note 14 for detailed information regarding the number and nature of cases in trial and scheduled for trial through December 31, 2007. RJR Tobacco expects that the factors described above will continue to have the primary impact on its product liability defense costs in the future. Given the level of activity in cases in preparation for trial, in trial and on appeal and the amount of product liability defense costs incurred by RJR Tobacco over the past three years, RJR Tobaccos recent experiences in defending its product liability cases and the reasonably anticipated level of activity in RJR Tobaccos pending cases and possible new cases, RJR Tobacco does not expect that the variances in its product liability defense costs will be significantly different than they have been historically, aside from the assumption of certain B&W litigation and the potential for increased individual case filings in Florida due to the Engle decision. See Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Class Action Suits Engle Case in note 14 to consolidated financial statements for additional information. However, it is possible that adverse developments in the factors discussed above, as well as other circumstances beyond the control of RJR Tobacco, could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations or cash flows of RAI or its subsidiaries. Those other circumstances beyond the control of RJR Tobacco include the results of present and future trials and appeals, and the development of possible new theories of liability by plaintiffs and their counsel. Conwood The Conwood acquisition occurred on May 31, 2006, and consequently, the RAI consolidated statement of income includes only the results of operations of Conwood for June through December 2006. Conwoods moist snuff products accounted for approximately 75% of Conwoods total net sales of $291 million for June through December 2006. Conwoods net sales are dependent upon premium versus price value brand mix and list pricing, offset by promotional spending, trade incentives and federal excise taxes. Conwoods operating income of $160 million for June through December 2006 includes $10 million of integration costs. The shares of Conwoods moist snuff products and volume discussion presented below include periods prior to the acquisition by RAI for enhanced analysis. The Conwood shares of the moist snuff category as a percentage of total share of U.S. retail moist snuff sales, according to distributor reported data(1) processed by MSAi, were as follows: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31,(2) Share Point 2006 2005 Change Moist snuff: Premium KODIAK 5.09 % 5.83 % (0.74 ) Other 0.33 % 0.39 % (0.06 ) 5.42 % 6.22 % (0.80 ) Price value GRIZZLY 19.45 % 16.03 % 3.42 Other 0.28 % 0.41 % (0.13 ) 19.73 % 16.44 % 3.29 Total moist snuff 25.15 % 22.67 % 2.48 (1) Distributor shipments to retail share of U.S. moist snuff is included in this document because it is used by Conwood primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants and brands and market trends. You should not rely on the market share data reported by distributors and processed by MSAi as being a 80 Table of Contents precise measurement of actual market share because this distributor data set is not able to effectively track all volume. (2) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. GRIZZLYs growth led Conwoods share position to 25.15% of the moist snuff market in 2006, an increase of 2.48 share points from 2005. GRIZZLYs price value share position was 45.71% of that market in 2006, an increase of 4.22% from 2005. In 2006, Conwood introduced GRIZZLY long cut natural in 20 states to further enhance GRIZZLYs growth potential. Conwoods total moist snuff shipment volume increased 18.4% in 2006 from 2005, including GRIZZLYs 29.1% volume growth. For the industry, the overall moist snuff category volume increase is estimated to be between 6% and 7% for 2006. All Other All Other operating income for 2006 was favorably impacted by the growth of Santa Fes NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand. In addition, 2005 was impacted by the $24 million loss relating to the sale of the packaging operations. See note 4 to consolidated financial statements for information relating to the sale of the packaging operations. RAI Consolidated Interest and debt expense was $270 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $157 million from 2005. This increase is primarily due to higher debt balances resulting from the debt incurred by RAI to fund the Conwood acquisition in May 2006. Interest income was $136 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $51 million from 2005. This increase is primarily due to higher interest rates and, to a lesser extent, higher average cash balances. Other (income) expense, net was $13 million income in 2006 compared with $15 million expense in 2005. The change was primarily due to favorable foreign exchange revaluation of $14 million and increased earnings relating to the joint venture, coupled with the 2005 net costs of $7 million related to the extinguishment of the 2006 notes. Provision for income taxes was a provision of $673 million, or an effective rate of 37.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with a provision of $431 million, or an effective rate of 30.4%, in 2005. The 2006 provision was impacted by state taxes and nondeductible items, including certain expenditures relating to ballot initiatives, offset in part by the resolution of certain prior years tax matters that resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of $17 million. The 2005 provision was impacted by the resolution of certain prior years tax matters that resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of $78 million, offset in part by state taxes and certain nondeductible items. RAI expects its effective tax rate to approximate 37% in 2007. Discontinued operations reflect transactions related to the 1999 sale of the international tobacco business to JTI. During 2005, these transactions included $2 million of after tax reversals of indemnification accruals. Including these adjustments, the net after tax gain on the sale of the international tobacco business was $2.5 billion. Extraordinary items included a gain of $74 million and $55 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to the 2000 acquisition of RJRs former parent, NGH, primarily from settlement of tax matters. Including these adjustments, the net after tax gain on the acquisition was $1.8 billion. 81 Table of Contents 2005 Compared with 2004 For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % Change Net sales(1) $ 8,256 $ 6,437 28.3 % Cost of products sold(1),(2) 4,919 3,872 27.0 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,611 1,455 10.7 % Loss on sale of assets 24 NM (3) Amortization expense 41 24 70.8 % Restructuring and asset impairment charges 2 5 (60.0 )% Goodwill and trademark impairment charges 200 199 Operating income $ 1,459 $ 882 65.4 % (1) Excludes excise taxes of $2,175 million and $1,850 million for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. (2) See Cost of products sold below for further information related to settlement and federal tobacco buyout expense. (3) Percent change is not meaningful. Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005, increased $1.8 billion from the comparable prior year, primarily due to increased volume of $1.3 billion, driven by the B&W business combination, and higher pricing net of higher discounting. Net sales also includes an increase of $236 million due to related party sales, primarily relating to contract manufacturing for BAT affiliates. RAIs net sales are dependent upon its shipment volume in a declining market, premium versus value brand mix, and list pricing, offset by promotional spending, trade incentives and federal excise taxes. Domestic cigarette shipment volume, in billions of units, for RAIs operating subsidiaries and the industry segments were as follows(1): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2005 2004 % Change RJR Tobacco investment brands: CAMEL excluding non filter 22.0 21.6 1.9 % KOOL 11.8 4.9 NM (3) RJR Tobacco selective support brands: DORAL 17.1 18.3 (6.4 )% WINSTON 14.2 14.8 (4.0 )% SALEM 7.6 8.9 (14.2 )% PALL MALL Savings 5.8 2.5 NM (3) RJR Tobacco non support brands 28.8 20.6 NM (3) RJR Tobacco total premium 64.8 57.0 13.8 % RJR Tobacco total value 42.6 34.6 22.8 % RJR Tobacco total domestic 107.4 91.6 17.2 % Other 2.5 2.2 10.4 % RAI total domestic 109.8 93.8 17.0 % Industry(2): Premium 271.3 274.4 (1.1 )% Value 109.7 120.1 (8.6 )% Industry total domestic 381.0 394.5 (3.4 )% 82 Table of Contents (1) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. (2) Based on information from MSAi as provided for the year ended December 31, 2005. (3) Percent change is not meaningful due to only five months of sales in 2004 for KOOL, PALL MALL and other former B&W brands. RJR Tobaccos full year total domestic shipment volume increased 17.2% reflecting the impact of the B&W business combination offset in part by the changes in the brand strategy implemented in 2005, the underlying declines in consumption, or retail sales to consumers, and two less shipping days compared with 2004. Shipments in the premium tier decreased to 60.4% of RJR Tobaccos total domestic shipments during 2005 as compared with 62.2% in 2004. This decrease is primarily due to the combination of the former B&W brands beginning in August 2004, which were more heavily weighted in the value category. Industry premium shipments as a percentage of total domestic shipments increased to 71.2% in 2005 from 69.6% in 2004. The shares of U.S. retail cigarette sales of RJR Tobacco are presented as if the portfolio resulting from the B&W business combination had been combined as of the beginning of 2004. The shares of RJR Tobacco as a percentage of total share of U.S. retail cigarette sales according to data(1) from IRI were as follows(2): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Share Point 2005 2004 Change RJR Tobacco investment brands: CAMEL excluding non filter 6.68 % 6.28 % 0.40 KOOL 2.98 % 2.80 % 0.18 RJR Tobacco selective support brands: DORAL 4.68 % 4.98 % (0.30 ) WINSTON 4.02 % 4.16 % (0.14 ) SALEM 2.19 % 2.59 % (0.39 ) PALL MALL Savings 1.54 % 1.49 % 0.05 RJR Tobacco non support brands 7.88 % 8.52 % (0.63 ) RJR Tobacco total domestic 29.98 % 30.82 % (0.84 ) (1) Retail share of U.S. cigarette sales data is included in this document because it is used by RJR Tobacco primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants and brands and market trends. You should not rely on the market share data reported by IRI as being a precise measurement of actual market share because IRI is not able to effectively track all volume. Moreover, you should be aware that in a product market experiencing overall declining consumption, a particular product can experience increasing market share relative to competing products, yet still be subject to declining consumption volumes. (2) During 2006, IRI revised its data regarding participants shares of U.S. retail cigarette sales. Data provided herein reflects previously published data using IRIs historical methodology. The 2005 retail share of market of CAMELs filtered styles continued to grow compared with 2004 based on the strength of the brands equity, driven by its Pleasure to Burn positioning. In addition, RJR Tobacco launched Turkish Silver in April 2005. Initiatives launched in prior years to actively market CAMELs three distinct product families Classic, Turkish and Exotic Blends also contributed to the brands performance in 2005. In 2005, KOOL also increased its share to its highest level since 1999. During 2005, RJR Tobacco introduced KOOLs Be True advertising campaign and launched the KOOL menthol lights box style to support KOOLs future growth potential. 83 Table of Contents The combined share of market of the investment brands grew 0.58% during 2005 compared with 0.28% growth during 2004. However, the decline in share of selective support and non support brands more than offset the gains on the investment brands. Within the selective support brands, PALL MALL Savings continued to show slight share growth during 2005. The share results for 2005 were in line with RJR Tobaccos brand portfolio strategy. RJR Tobaccos premium share position of 18.4% of the market in 2005 declined 0.19 share points from 2004, compared with the 2004 decline from 2003 of 0.40 share points. RJR Tobaccos value share position of 11.6% of the market in 2005 declined 0.65 share points from 2004, compared with the 2004 decline from 2003 of 0.87 share points. Cost of products sold increased $1.0 billion from 2004 primarily due to increased MSA settlement and federal tobacco buyout expenses, as detailed in the schedule below. The increase in cost of products sold also was driven by integration costs of $14 million and $364 million higher product costs primarily related to volume of acquired operations, including contract manufacturing for certain BAT affiliates. Cost of products sold includes the following components for MSA and other state settlements, and federal tobacco buyout expenses for the years ended December 31: 2005 2004 Settlement $ 2,641 $ 2,252 Phase II growers liability offset (79 ) (69 ) Phase II growers liability expense 38 Total settlement expense $ 2,600 $ 2,183 Federal tobacco quota buyout $ 264 $ 70 Federal quota tobacco stock liquidation assessment 81 Total quota buyout expense $ 345 $ 70 Selling, general and administrative expenses of $1,611 million during 2005 increased $156 million, compared with 2004, primarily due to increased legal expenses and other increased costs related to acquired operations, partially offset by $33 million growers settlement and $17 million related to a California settlement recorded in 2004 and lower integration costs of $93 million in 2005 compared with $130 million in 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs of litigating and administering product liability claims, as well as other legal expenses. During 2005 and 2004, RJR Tobaccos product liability defense costs were $153 million and $115 million, respectively. The increase in product liability defense costs in 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily related to the assumption of certain B&W litigation as a result of the B&W business combination and the Department of Justice case. Loss on sale of assets of $24 million relates to RJR Tobaccos sale of its packaging operations on May 2, 2005, to a consortium of five packaging companies for $48 million. RJR Tobacco agreed to provide severance and related benefits to employees who would not receive offers for ongoing employment from the consortium of buyers. Accordingly, the loss includes approximately $27 million for severance and related benefits to be paid by RJR Tobacco to approximately 170 employees out of approximately 740 employees who served the packaging operations at the time of disposition. RJR Tobacco also agreed to provide a transition bonus to eligible employees who continue to work during the transition period, which is expected to be completed by mid year 2007. With the termination of the packaging employees, RJR Tobacco incurred a net curtailment gain of $10 million, reflecting $3 million of pension expense and $13 million of postretirement income. Pursuant to various supply contracts entered into between the buyers and RJR Tobacco, RJR Tobacco will continue to obtain its packaging materials from certain of the buyers. As a result of certain transitional supply pricing, which is above current market prices, $14 million was accrued as part of the loss. Accordingly, anticipated purchases over the transition period will be recorded at approximate current market prices. 84 Table of Contents Amortization expense of $41 million and $24 million were recorded during 2005 and 2004, respectively, relating to intangibles acquired in the B&W business combination and finite lived trademarks. For additional information, see note 1 to consolidated financial statements. Restructuring and asset impairment charge adjustments in 2005 resulted in net additional charges of $2 million relating to the 2002 restructuring. Adjustments in 2004 resulted in net additional charges of $38 million relating to the 2002 restructuring partially offset by net reversals of $33 million relating to the 2003 restructuring. See note 4 to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to restructuring charges. Goodwill and trademark impairment charges include $198 million for trademark impairments in 2005 compared with $199 million incurred during 2004. Also in 2005, $2 million of goodwill impairment charges was incurred relating to the excess of book value over fair value of assets reclassified to held for sale concerning Lanes pipe manufacturing business. This business was sold on January 26, 2006, for $4 million. In connection with the annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2004, an impairment of $199 million occurred on certain of RJR Tobaccos non investment brands, reflecting RJR Tobaccos decision in the fourth quarter of 2004, to implement the brand strategies resulting from the B&W business combination, and limit investment in these brands in an effort to optimize profitability. In connection with the annual impairment testing of goodwill and certain intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2005, an impairment of $198 million occurred, reflecting modification to the previously anticipated level of support among certain brands, and also from the strategic plan projecting net sales of certain brands to decline at a faster rate than was assumed in the prior year strategic plan. These impairment charges were based on the excess of certain brands carrying values over their fair values, determined with the assistance of an independent appraisal firm, using the present value of estimated future cash flows assuming a discount rate of 11.0% in each of 2005 and 2004. The discount rate was determined by adjusting the RJR Tobacco enterprise discount rate by an appropriate risk premium to reflect an asset group risk. These impairment charges are reflected as decreases in the carrying value of the trademarks in the consolidated balance sheets, as goodwill and trademark impairment charges in the consolidated income statements and had no impact on cash flows. Interest and debt expense was $113 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $28 million from 2004. This increase is primarily due to higher average debt balances, resulting from the June 2005 private offering, in addition to higher interest rates impacting interest rate swaps. Interest income was $85 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of $55 million from 2004. This increase is primarily due to higher interest rates and, to a lesser extent, higher average cash balances. Other (income) expense, net was $15 million expense in 2005 compared with $2 million income in 2004. The change was primarily due to $7 million of net costs related to the extinguishment of the 2006 notes and unfavorable foreign exchange revaluation. Provision for income taxes was a provision of $431 million, or an effective rate of 30.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2005, compared with a provision of $202 million, or an effective rate of 24.4%, in 2004. The 2005 provision was impacted mainly by the resolution of certain prior years tax matters that resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of $78 million and $14 million deduction as a result of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, offset in part by state taxes and certain nondeductible items. In the fourth quarter of 2005, RAI recorded an adjustment of $13 million as a decrease in income tax expense and a corresponding decrease in deferred tax liabilities. This adjustment resulted from differences between the deferred tax liabilities recorded in prior periods and the underlying cumulative timing differences supporting them. The 2004 provision was impacted by the resolution of certain prior years tax matters of $126 million, offset in part by state taxes and certain nondeductible items. Discontinued operations reflect transactions related to the 1999 sale of the international tobacco business to JTI. During 2005 and 2004, these transactions included $2 million and $12 million, respectively, of after tax reversals of indemnification accruals. Including these adjustments, the net after tax gain on the sale of the international tobacco business was $2.5 billion. 85 Table of Contents Extraordinary items included a gain of $55 million and $49 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively, related to the 2000 acquisition of RJRs former parent, NGH, primarily from settlement of tax matters. Including these adjustments, the net after tax gain on the acquisition was $1.7 billion. Liquidity and Financial Condition Liquidity At present, the principal sources of liquidity for RAIs operating subsidiaries businesses and operating needs are internally generated funds from their operations and borrowings through RAI and RJR. Cash flows from operating activities are believed to be sufficient for the foreseeable future to enable the operating subsidiaries to meet their obligations under the MSA, to fund their capital expenditures and to make payments to RAI and RJR that, when combined with RAIs and RJRs cash balances, will enable RAI and RJR to make their required debt service payments, and enable RAI to pay dividends to its shareholders. The negative impact, if any, on the sources of liquidity that could result from a decrease in demand for products due to short term inventory adjustments by wholesale and retail distributors, changes in competitive pricing or accelerated declines in consumption, cannot be predicted. RAI cannot predict its cash requirements or those of its subsidiaries related to any future settlements or judgments, including cash required to be held in escrow or to bond any appeals, if necessary, and RAI makes no assurance that it or its subsidiaries will be able to meet all of those requirements. Contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 were as follows: Payments Due by Period Less than 1 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Total Year 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Long term notes, exclusive of interest(1) $ 3,191 $ 329 $ 199 $ 299 $ 2,364 RAI Credit Facilities(1) 1,542 15 31 31 1,465 Interest payments related to long term notes and RAI Credit Facilities(1) 2,125 331 618 580 596 Operating leases(2) 79 21 29 16 13 Non qualified pension obligations(3) 66 6 13 13 34 Postretirement benefit obligations(3) 741 75 149 150 367 Qualified pension funding(3) 294 294 Purchase obligations(4) 1,897 379 505 336 677 Other noncurrent liabilities(5) 109 N/A 67 5 37 MSA and other state settlement obligations(6) 14,040 2,600 5,660 5,780 Federal tobacco buyout obligations(7) 2,125 265 535 555 770 Total cash obligations $ 26,209 $ 4,315 $ 7,806 $ 7,765 $ 6,323 (1) For more information about RAIs long term notes and credit facilities, see Debt below and notes 11 and 12 to consolidated financial statements. (2) Operating lease obligations represent estimated lease payments primarily related to office space, automobiles, warehouse space and computer equipment. See note 20 to consolidated financial statements for additional information. (3) For more information about RAIs pension plans and postretirement benefits, see note 17 to consolidated financial statements. Non qualified pension and postretirement benefit obligations captioned under Thereafter include obligations during the next five years only. These obligations are not reasonably estimable beyond ten years. Qualified pension plan funding is based on Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation requirements, Pension Protection Act and tax deductibility and is not reasonably estimable beyond one year. 86 Table of Contents (4) Purchase obligations include commitments to acquire tobacco leaf, leaf processing, media services, capital expenditures and software maintenance. The major component of the purchase obligations, although not believed to be incremental to previously anticipated leaf purchase needs, is the estimated value of the commitment to purchase leaf as a part of the settlement agreement reached in the DeLoach antitrust case. See note 14 to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the DeLoach case. (5) Other noncurrent liabilities include primarily restructuring and bonus compensation. Certain other noncurrent liabilities are excluded from the table above, including RJRs liabilities recorded in 1999 related to certain indemnification claims, for which timing of payments are not estimable. For more information about RJRs indemnification obligations, see note 14 to consolidated financial statements. (6) MSA and other state settlement obligation amounts in the aggregate beyond five years are not meaningful as these are obligations into perpetuity. For more information about the MSA and other state settlement, see note 14 to consolidated financial statements. (7) For more information about the tobacco buyout legislation, see Governmental Activity below and note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Commitments as of December 31, 2006 were as follows: Commitment Expiration Period Less than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years Standby letters of credit backed by revolving credit facility $ 25 $ 24 $ 1 Total commitments $ 25 $ 24 $ 1 Cash Flows 2006 Compared with 2005 Net cash flows from operating activities were $1.5 billion in 2006, compared with $1.3 billion in 2005. This increase is primarily due to an increase in net income of $98 million, excluding non cash charges and the receipt of an IRS tax refund in 2006, partially offset by higher pension funding and higher income taxes paid in 2006. Net cash flows for 2006 were also favorably impacted by the $178 million classification of certain book overdrafts as accounts payable compared with the 2005 classification in cash and cash equivalents, resulting from changes in certain banking relationships. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $3.5 billion in 2006, compared with $989 million in 2005. This change is primarily due to the acquisition of Conwood for $3.5 billion, offset in part by lower net purchases of short term investments of $981 million. Net cash flows from financing activities were $2.2 billion in 2006, compared with net cash flows used in financing activities of $450 million in 2005. This change is primarily due to $3.2 billion in proceeds from RAIs debt issuances to fund the Conwood acquisition and lower debt repayment, offset in part by higher dividends paid per share of common stock. 2005 Compared with 2004 Net cash flows from operating activities of $1.3 billion in 2005 increased $537 million from 2004. This change is primarily due to higher net income, lower restructuring and income tax payments, favorable related party movements and favorable inventory movements due to lower leaf costs, changes in leaf durations and lower finished goods. These increases were offset in part by higher 2005 MSA payments and higher pension funding in 2005. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $989 million in 2005 compared with net cash flows from investing activities of $260 million in 2004. This change is primarily due to the 2005 net purchases of short term investments of $898 million compared with the 2004 net proceeds from the sales of short term investments of $188 million. Also, the 2005 net cash flows used in investing activities include $45 million related to the purchase of the U.S. duty free and U.S. military overseas businesses relating to certain brands from JTI compared with 87 Table of Contents $204 million in net cash proceeds acquired in the B&W business combination. For 2005, cash flows from investing activities also includes $48 million related to the sale of RJR Tobaccos packaging operations. Net cash flows used in financing activities were $450 million in 2005 compared with $467 million in 2004. This change is primarily due to the $499 million debt issuance proceeds in June 2005 less $360 million for repayments of long term debt related to the tender offer for the 2006 notes. This decrease was offset in part by higher dividends paid reflecting primarily the outstanding shares of common stock issued in consideration of the business combination and, to a lesser extent, the increased dividend rate in 2005. Stock Repurchases RAI repurchases and cancels shares of its common stock forfeited with respect to the tax liability associated with certain option exercises and vesting of restricted stock grants under the RAI Long Term Incentive Plan. Accordingly, during 2006, RAI repurchased and cancelled 207 shares of its common stock. On February 6, 2007, the board of directors of RAI authorized the repurchase by RAI of up to $75 million of its outstanding shares of common stock to offset dilution from restricted stock grants under employee incentive programs and the exercise of previously granted options. Dividends On February 6, 2007, RAIs board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.75 per common share. The dividend will be paid on April 2, 2007 to shareholders of record as of March 15, 2007. On an annualized basis, the dividend rate is $3.00 per common share. The current dividend reflects RAIs policy of paying dividends to the holders of RAIs common stock in an aggregate amount that is approximately 75% of RAIs annual consolidated net income. Capital Expenditures RAIs operating subsidiaries recorded capital expenditures of $133 million, $110 million and $92 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Of the 2006 amount, $116 million related to RJR Tobacco and $4 million related to Conwood. RJR Tobacco plans to spend $140 million to $150 million for capital expenditures during 2007, and Conwood plans to spend $40 million to $50 million. Conwoods increase in capital expenditures in 2007 is primarily related to the expansion of manufacturing facilities. Capital expenditures are funded primarily by cash flows from operations. RAIs operating subsidiaries capital expenditure programs are expected to continue at a level sufficient to support their strategic and operating needs. There were no material long term commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2006. Debt Credit Facilities On May 31, 2006, RAI entered into new $2.1 billion senior, secured credit facilities, consisting of a six year $1.55 billion secured term loan and a five year, $550 million secured revolving credit facility, together referred to as RAI Credit Facilities. The credit agreement related to the RAI Credit Facilities is an amendment and restatement of the agreement related to RJRs prior revolving credit facility, which the RAI revolving credit facility replaced. RAIs proceeds from the term loan were used, together with the net proceeds of a private debt offering and available cash, to finance the Conwood acquisition. RAIs term loan requires quarterly, mandatory repayments of approximately $4 million, which began on September 30, 2006. An additional mandatory repayment is due 110 days after the last day of each year, commencing December 31, 2007, equal to excess cash flow as defined in the credit agreement, including reductions for, among other things, capital expenditures, cash dividends, debt principal payments and pension funding. RAI is able to use the RAI revolving credit facility for borrowings and issuances of letters of credit, at its option. Also, at the request of RAI and the discretion of the lenders, RAI is able to increase the borrowing limit under the revolving credit facility by $250 million. At December 31, 2006, RAI had $25 million in letters of credit 88 Table of Contents outstanding under its revolving credit facility. No borrowings were outstanding, and the remaining $525 million of the revolving credit facility was available for borrowing. Under the terms of the RAI Credit Facilities, RAI is not required to maintain compensating balances; however, RAI is required to pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.75% to 1.50% per annum on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility. Borrowings under the RAI Credit Facilities bear interest, at the option of RAI, at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus: the reference rate, which is the higher of the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% and the prime rate; or the Eurodollar rate, which is the rate at which Eurodollar deposits for one, two, three or six months are offered in the interbank Eurodollar market. The term loans applicable margin is subject to adjustment based upon RAIs consolidated leverage ratio. At December 31, 2006, RAI had the following term loan amounts outstanding: $850 million bearing interest at the November 30, 2006, six month LIBOR rate plus 1.750%; $650 million bearing interest at the September 5, 2006, six month LIBOR rate plus 1.750%; and $42 million at the December 29, 2006, three month LIBOR rate plus 1.750%. The RAI Credit Facilities have restrictive covenants that limit RAIs and its subsidiaries ability to pay dividends and repurchase stock, make investments, prepay certain indebtedness, incur indebtedness, engage in transactions with affiliates, create liens, acquire, sell or dispose of specific assets and engage in specified mergers or consolidations. Under the revolving credit facility, RAIs cumulative dividends generally may not exceed the sum of $625 million plus 75% of cumulative adjusted net income (as defined in the credit agreement). RAIs material domestic subsidiaries, including RJR, RJR Tobacco, Santa Fe, Lane, GPI and Conwood, guarantee RAIs obligations under the RAI Credit Facilities. These guarantors also have pledged substantially all of their assets to secure these obligations, including indebtedness and other obligations held by or owing to such guarantor of a subsidiary. RAI has pledged substantially all of its assets, including the stock of its direct subsidiaries to secure such obligations. RJR has pledged its interest in RJR Tobacco common stock as collateral for the RAI Credit Facilities. Under the terms of the RAI Credit Facilities, the collateral will be released automatically in certain circumstances, including at such time, if any, as the term loan is paid in full and RAI obtains an investment grade corporate credit rating by each of Moodys and S&P. Long term Debt On May 19, 2006, RAI commenced, in a private offering, an offer to exchange up to $1.45 billion of RJRs outstanding guaranteed, secured notes for like principal amounts of new RAI guaranteed, secured notes. The offer was made to certain institutional holders of the RJR notes. Each new series of RAI notes has identical terms as the corresponding series of RJR notes with respect to interest rates, redemption terms and interest payment and maturity dates. In conjunction with the exchange offer, consents were solicited from the RJR noteholders to eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants and to eliminate an event of default from the RJR indentures governing the series of RJR notes subject to the exchange offer. The requisite number of consents were received, and, as a result, the remaining RJR notes are now unsecured. At the closing of the exchange offer on June 20, 2006, approximately 89% of the RJR notes were validly tendered for exchange and were accepted by RAI. The tendered RJR notes were cancelled. The $161 million aggregate principal amount of RJR notes that are still outstanding under the amended RJR indentures are now unsecured, but remain guaranteed by certain of RJRs subsidiaries, including RJR Tobacco, and RJRs parent, RAI. On September 30, 2006, GPI and RJR Packaging, LLC were added as guarantors of RJRs long term unsecured notes. RJR also has $89 million of other non bank debt that is neither secured nor guaranteed. On October 25, 2006, RAI filed a registration statement with the SEC, which became effective November 7, 2006, pursuant to which RAI offered to exchange the $161 million of remaining RJR unsecured notes for RAI registered secured notes. At the expiration of the exchange offer on February 15, 2007, 29% of the RJR notes had been validly tendered for exchange and were accepted by RAI. On May 31, 2006, RAI completed a private offering of $1.65 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior, secured notes, consisting of $625 million of 7.25% senior secured notes due June 1, 2013, $775 million of 7.625% senior secured notes due June 1, 2016 and $250 million of 7.75% senior secured notes due June 1, 2018. 89 Table of Contents RAIs net proceeds from the private offering, together with the proceeds from the term loan and available cash, were used to finance the Conwood acquisition. On October 3, 2006, RAI filed a registration statement with the SEC, which became effective November 7, 2006, pursuant to which RAI offered to exchange $2.939 billion of RAI privately placed secured notes for RAI registered secured notes. The notes subject to such exchange offer represented the notes that had been issued in the May 19 and May 31, 2006, private offerings of RAI. This exchange offer was made in satisfaction of RAIs obligations under registration rights agreements that had been entered into in connection with RAIs prior private offerings. At the expiration of the exchange offer on December 8, 2006, 99% of the privately placed secured notes had been validly tendered for exchange and were accepted by RAI. In conjunction with their obligations under the RAI Credit Facilities, RAIs material domestic subsidiaries, including RJR, RJR Tobacco, Santa Fe, Lane, GPI and Conwood, guarantee RAIs long term secured notes. RJR has pledged its interest in RJR Tobacco common stock as collateral for RAIs long term secured notes. Also, RJR Tobaccos and Conwoods material subsidiaries have pledged their principal properties to secure these obligations. These assets constitute a portion of the security for the obligations of RAI and the guarantors under the RAI Credit Facilities. The collateral securing RAIs long term senior secured notes will be released automatically in certain circumstances. If these assets are no longer pledged as security for the obligations of RAI and the guarantors under the RAI Credit Facilities, or any other indebtedness of RAI, they will be released automatically as security for RAIs senior secured notes and the related guarantees. Generally, the terms of RAIs guaranteed senior secured notes restrict the pledge of collateral, sale/leaseback transactions and the transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of certain of RAIs subsidiaries. On March 14, 2006, RJR filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC, immediately effective upon filing, for an indeterminate amount of debt securities. Pursuant to this shelf registration statement, RJR may issue debt securities guaranteed by its parent, RAI, and certain of RJRs subsidiaries, including RJR Tobacco. As of the date of this filing, no debt securities have been issued thereunder. As of December 31, 2006, Moodys corporate credit rating of RAI was Ba2, positive outlook, and S&Ps rating was BB+, stable outlook. On February 12, 2007, Moodys corporate credit rating of RAI was changed to Ba1, positive outlook. Concerns about, or lowering of, RAIs corporate ratings by S&P or Moodys could have an adverse impact on RAIs ability to access the debt markets and could increase borrowing costs. However, given the cash balances and operating performance of RAI and its subsidiaries, RAIs management believes that such concerns about, or further lowering of, such ratings would not have a material adverse impact on RAIs cash flows. As of December 31, 2006, long term debt consisted of the following: December 31, 2006 RJR 8.5% 9.25% unsecured notes, due 2007 to 2013 $ 89 RJR 6.5% 7.875% guaranteed, unsecured notes, due 2007 to 2015 163 Total RJR debt 252 RAI 6.5% 7.875% guaranteed, secured notes, due 2007 to 2015(1) 1,298 RAI 7.25% 7.75% guaranteed, secured notes, due 2013 to 2018(2) 1,641 RAI floating rate, guaranteed, secured, term loan, due 2012 1,542 Total RAI debt 4,481 Total debt 4,733 Current maturities of long term debt (344 ) $ 4,389 (1) RAI debt arising from the RJR exchanged notes; see above for additional information. (2) RAI newly issued long term debt; see above for additional information. 90 Table of Contents At its option, RAI and RJR, as applicable, may redeem any or all of their outstanding notes, in whole or in part at any time, subject to the payment of a make whole premium. RAI and RJR use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on a portion of their debt obligations. Under certain conditions, any fair value that results in a liability position of the interest rate swaps may require full collateralization with cash or securities. RAI, RJR and their affiliates were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions imposed by their indebtedness at December 31, 2006. Litigation and Settlements Various legal claims, including litigation claiming that cancer and other diseases, as well as addiction, have resulted from the use of, or exposure to, RAIs operating subsidiaries products, are pending or may be instituted against RJR Tobacco, Conwood and their affiliates, including RAI, or indemnitees. For further discussion of the litigation and legal proceedings pending against RAI or its affiliates or indemnitees, see note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Even though RAIs management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees, or the loss of any particular claim concerning the use of smokeless tobacco against Conwood, when viewed on an individual basis, is not probable, the possibility of material losses related to tobacco litigation is more than remote. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and generally it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against RJR Tobacco, Conwood or their affiliates or indemnitees, or to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss. Moreover, notwithstanding the quality of defenses available to it and its affiliates in tobacco related litigation matters, it is possible that RAIs financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of certain pending or future litigation matters. In November 1998, RJR Tobacco, B&W and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers entered into the MSA with attorneys general representing most U.S. states, territories and possessions. As described in note 14 to consolidated financial statements, the MSA imposes a stream of future payment obligations on RJR Tobacco and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers and places significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell cigarettes in the future. For more information related to historical and expected settlement expenses and payments under the MSA and other state settlement agreements, see Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Governmental Health Care Cost Recovery Cases MSA and Other State Settlement Agreements in note 14 to consolidated financial statements. The MSA and other state settlement agreements have materially adversely affected RJR Tobaccos shipment volumes. RAI believes that these settlement obligations may materially adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows or financial condition of RAI and RJR Tobacco in future periods. The degree of the adverse impact will depend, among other things, on the rate of decline in U.S. cigarette sales in the premium and value categories, RJR Tobaccos share of the domestic premium and value cigarette categories, and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to the MSA and other state settlement agreements. The MSA includes an adjustment, referred to as an NPM Adjustment, that potentially reduces RJR Tobaccos and other participating manufacturers annual payment obligations. Certain requirements must be satisfied before the NPM Adjustment, which relates to a specified market year, is available. In April 2006, RJR Tobacco placed $647 million of its MSA payment into a disputed payments account, in accordance with a procedure established by the MSA. That amount represented RJR Tobaccos share of the 2003 NPM Adjustment as calculated by an independent auditor designated under the MSA. During 2006, proceedings were initiated and prosecuted with respect to an NPM Adjustment for 2004. The independent auditor determined that the participating manufacturers again suffered a market share loss sufficient to trigger an NPM Adjustment for 2004. On April 17, 2006, RJR Tobacco and the other cigarette manufacturers initiated the significant factor proceedings called for under the MSA. On February 12, 2007, the independent economic consulting firm retained by the settling states and the cigarette manufacturers issued a final, non 91 Table of Contents appealable determination that the disadvantages of the MSA were a significant factor contributing to the 2004 market share loss. RJR Tobacco is evaluating what action to take in light of this determination. The settling states contend that RJR Tobacco and other participating manufacturers are not entitled to the 2003 NPM Adjustment. As of February 2, 2007, of the settling states, 37 had filed legal proceedings seeking orders compelling RJR Tobacco and the other participating manufacturers that placed money in the disputed payments account to pay such disputed amounts to the settling states. RJR Tobacco intends to defend these proceedings vigorously by, among other things, moving to compel arbitration as provided in the MSA. As of February 2, 2007, 35 courts had addressed whether disputes concerning the 2003 NPM Adjustment are arbitrable, and 34 had ruled that arbitration is required under the MSA. See note 14 to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding these proceedings. Governmental Activity The marketing, sale, taxation and use of tobacco products have been subject to substantial regulation by government and health officials for many years. Various state governments have adopted or are considering, among other things, legislation and regulations that would: significantly increase their taxes on tobacco products; restrict displays, advertising and sampling of tobacco products; establish ignition propensity standards for cigarettes; raise the minimum age to possess or purchase tobacco products; restrict or ban the use of certain flavorings in tobacco products; require the disclosure of ingredients used in the manufacture of tobacco products; require the disclosure of nicotine yield information for cigarettes based on a machine test method different from that required by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission; impose restrictions on smoking in public and private areas; and restrict the sale of tobacco products directly to consumers or other unlicensed recipients, including over the Internet. In addition, during 2007, the U.S. Congress will consider regulation of the manufacture and sale of tobacco products by the FDA, and also may consider legislation regarding: further increases in the federal excise tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products; regulation of environmental tobacco smoke; additional warnings on tobacco packaging and advertising; reduction or elimination of the tax deductibility of advertising expenses; implementation of a national standard for fire safe cigarettes; regulation of the retail sale of tobacco products over the Internet and in other non face to face retail transactions, such as by mail order and telephone; and banning of the delivery of tobacco products by the U.S. Postal Service. In February 2007, proposed legislation was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate that would give the FDA broad regulatory authority over tobacco products. The proposals would grant the FDA authority to impose product standards (including standards relating to, among other things, nicotine yields and smoke constituents) and would reinstate the FDAs 1996 proposed legislation that would have restricted marketing. The proposed legislation also would govern modified risk products and would impose new and larger warning labels on tobacco products. 92 Table of Contents Together with manufacturers price increases in recent years and substantial increases in state and federal taxes on tobacco products, these developments have had and will likely continue to have an adverse effect on the sale of tobacco products. Cigarettes are subject to substantial excise taxes in the United States. The federal excise tax per pack of 20 cigarettes is $0.39. All states and the District of Columbia currently impose excise taxes at levels ranging from $0.07 per pack in South Carolina to $2.575 per pack in New Jersey. On December 31, 2006, the weighted average state cigarette excise tax per pack, calculated on a 12 month rolling average basis, was approximately $0.799. Four states passed excise tax per pack increases in 2006: Texas ($0.41 to $1.41, effective January 1, 2007); New Jersey ($2.40 to $2.575, effective July 15, 2006); Vermont ($1.19 to $1.79 on July 1, 2006, and $1.79 to $1.99 on July 1, 2008); and Hawaii ($1.40 to $2.60 over six years, in six annual increments of $0.20, commencing October 1, 2006). Additionally, 2006 ballot initiatives to increase the cigarette excise tax in Arizona by $0.82 per pack and in South Dakota by $1.00 per pack were approved. Certain city and county governments, such as New York and Chicago, also impose substantial excise taxes on cigarettes sold in those jurisdictions. A federal excise tax was first imposed on smokeless tobacco products in 1986 and currently is $0.195 per pound for chewing tobacco, and $0.585 per pound for snuff. The federal tax on small cigars, defined as those weighing three pounds or less per thousand, is $1.828 per thousand. Large cigars are taxed at a rate of 20.719% of the manufacturers price, with a cap of $48.75 per thousand. Forty nine states also subject smokeless tobacco to excise taxes. As of December 31, 2006, 40 states taxed smokeless tobacco on an ad valorem basis at rates that range from 3% in North Carolina to 90% in Massachusetts. California, which adjusts its rate annually in an effort to equalize smokeless tobacco and cigarette taxes, currently imposes a rate of 46.76%. In 2006, Texas passed legislation that raises its ad valorem excise tax rate to 40% effective January 1, 2007. Alabama, Arizona, Connecticut, Montana and North Dakota tax moist snuff (and in Alabama, Arizona and North Dakota chewing tobacco as well) on the bases of weight at rates ranging from $0.01 for snuff units weighing less than 5/8 of an ounce in Alabama to $0.85 per ounce of snuff in Montana, and $0.015 per ounce for chewing tobacco in Alabama to $0.16 per ounce in North Dakota. Kentucky has a unit tax of $0.095 per unit on moist snuff. Three states changed the method of taxing moist snuff from an ad valorem basis to a weight based tax during 2006: Vermont ($1.49 per ounce), Rhode Island ($1.00 per ounce) and New Jersey ($0.75 per ounce). Cigars are generally taxed on an ad valorem basis, ranging from 3% in North Carolina to 75% in Alaska and Washington. Alabama, Arizona, Oklahoma and Texas have unit based tax schemes for cigars, while California, Connecticut, Florida, Iowa, Tennessee and Vermont tax little cigars the same as cigarettes. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania levies no tax on other tobacco products. On October 25, 2006, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Department of Treasury, referred to as the TTB, issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, proposing changes to the regulations that govern the classification and labeling of cigars and cigarettes for federal excise tax purposes. The proposed regulatory changes address concerns regarding the adequacy of current regulatory standards for distinguishing between cigars and cigarettes, with particular reference to the distinction between little cigars and cigarettes. The distinction between cigars and cigarettes is important for federal tax purposes because the rate of tax varies from one product class to another. For example, the rate of tax on little cigars (weighing not more than three pounds per thousand) is $1.828 per thousand, compared to the rate of tax on cigarettes (weighing not more than three pounds per thousand) which is $19.50 per thousand. It is estimated that at least three fourths of all recognized and established little cigar brands in the United States would be re classified as cigarettes under criteria established under the proposed regulations. Although the CAPTAIN BLACK and WINCHESTER little cigar brands manufactured by Lane have been classified and sold as little cigars for more than 16 years and 35 years, respectively, both brands would be re classified as cigarettes under these proposed regulations. Although it is not possible to fully assess and quantify the negative impact of the proposed regulations on the little cigar products of Lane, the immediate impact would be to increase the federal excise tax on such products by more than tenfold. The deadline for submitting written comments to TTB regarding the proposed regulations is March 26, 2007. In 1964, the Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service concluded that cigarette smoking was a health hazard of sufficient importance to warrant appropriate remedial 93 Table of Contents action. Since 1966, federal law has required a warning statement on cigarette packaging. Since 1971, television and radio advertising of cigarettes has been prohibited in the United States. Cigarette advertising in other media in the United States is required to include information with respect to the tar and nicotine yield of cigarettes, as well as a warning statement. During the past four decades, various laws affecting the cigarette industry have been enacted. In 1964, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act. Among other things, this act: establishes an interagency committee on smoking and health that is charged with carrying out a program to inform the public of any dangers to human health presented by cigarette smoking; requires a series of four health warnings to be printed on cigarette packages and advertising on a rotating basis; increases type size and area of the warning required in cigarette advertisements; and requires that cigarette manufacturers provide annually, on a confidential basis, a list of ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The warnings currently required on cigarette packages and advertisements are: SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease, Emphysema, And May Complicate Pregnancy; SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Quitting Smoking Now Greatly Reduces Serious Risks to Your Health; SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Smoking By Pregnant Women May Result in Fetal Injury, Premature Birth, And Low Birth Weight; and SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon Monoxide. Since the initial report in 1964, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare (now the Secretary of Health and Human Services) and the Surgeon General have issued a number of other reports which purport to find the nicotine in cigarettes addictive and to link cigarette smoking and exposure to cigarette smoke with certain health hazards, including various types of cancer, coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive lung disease. These reports have recommended various governmental measures to reduce the incidence of smoking. In 1992, the federal Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Act was signed into law. This act required states to adopt a minimum age of 18 for purchase of tobacco products and to establish a system to monitor, report and reduce the illegal sale of tobacco products to minors in order to continue receiving federal funding for mental health and drug abuse programs. In January 1996, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced regulations implementing this legislation. And in June 2006, the Surgeon General released a report entitled The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke. Among its conclusions, the report found the following: exposure of adults to secondhand smoke causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer, exposure of children to secondhand smoke results in an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome, acute respiratory infections, ear problems and more severe asthma; and that there is no risk free level of exposure to secondhand smoke. In 1986, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986, which, among other things, required health warning notices on smokeless tobacco packages and advertising and prohibited the advertising of smokeless tobacco products on any medium of electronic communications subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission. The warnings currently required on smokeless tobacco packages and advertising, which appear on a rotating basis, are: WARNING: THIS PRODUCT MAY CAUSE MOUTH CANCER; WARNING: THIS PRODUCT MAY CAUSE GUM DISEASE AND TOOTH LOSS; and WARNING: THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO CIGARETTES. 94 Table of Contents In June 2000, the seven largest U.S. cigar companies, including Lane, entered into agreements with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to clearly and conspicuously display on virtually every cigar package and advertisement one of the following warnings, which appear on a rotating basis: SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Cigar Smoking Can Cause Cancers Of The Mouth And Throat, Even If You Do Not Inhale; SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Cigar Smoking Can Cause Lung Cancer And Heart Disease; SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Tobacco Use Increases The Risk Of Infertility, Stillbirth And Low Birth Weight; SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Cigars Are Not A Safe Alternative To Cigarettes; and SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Tobacco Smoke Increases The Risk Of Lung Cancer And Heart Disease, Even In Nonsmokers. Legislation imposing various restrictions on public smoking also has been enacted in 49 states and many local jurisdictions, and many employers have initiated programs restricting or eliminating smoking in the workplace. A number of states have enacted legislation designating a portion of increased cigarette excise taxes to fund either anti smoking programs, health care programs or cancer research. In addition, educational and research programs addressing health care issues related to smoking are being funded from industry payments made or to be made under settlements with state attorneys general. Federal law prohibits smoking in scheduled passenger aircraft, and the U.S. Interstate Commerce Commission has banned smoking on buses transporting passengers interstate. Certain common carriers have imposed additional restrictions on passenger smoking. In December 2003, the California Environmental Protection Agency Air Resources Board issued a Proposed Identification of Environmental Tobacco Smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant for public review. On January 26, 2006, the Air Resources Board identified environmental tobacco smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant, following a three year administrative process. The Air Resources Board is now required to prepare a report assessing the need and appropriate degree of control of environmental tobacco smoke. RJR Tobacco cannot predict the form any future California regulation may take. On December 31, 2003, the New York Office of Fire Prevention and Control issued a final standard with accompanying regulations that requires all cigarettes offered for sale in New York State after June 28, 2004, to achieve specified test results when placed on ten layers of filter paper in controlled laboratory conditions. The cigarettes that RAIs operating companies sell in New York State comply with this standard. In 2005, California and Vermont, and in 2006, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Hampshire, each enacted fire safe legislation of its own, adopting the same testing standard set forth in the OFPC regulations described above. This requirement took effect in Vermont on May 1, 2006, and will take effect in California on January 1, 2007, in New Hampshire on October 1, 2007, and in Illinois and Massachusetts on January 1, 2008. Similar legislation is being considered in a number of other states. Varying standards from state to state could have an adverse effect on the business or results of operations of RJR Tobacco. On August 29, 2006, The Massachusetts Department of Public Health released a report entitled, Change in Nicotine Yields 1998 2004, based on data submitted by RJR Tobacco as well as other cigarette manufacturers pursuant to Massachusetts law. Under this law, cigarette manufactures are required to provide nicotine yield data generated under a machine test method different from that required by the FTC for all styles of a cigarette brand family that has a national market share of 3% or more as well as other brand styles selected by the MDPH. Other than Texas in 2000, no other state has passed similar regulations. However, Massachusetts recent report has generated interest from at least one other state for this type of information. A price differential exists between cigarettes manufactured for sale abroad and cigarettes manufactured for U.S. sale. Consequently, a domestic gray market has developed in cigarettes manufactured for sale abroad, but instead diverted for domestic sales that compete with cigarettes that RJR Tobacco manufactures for domestic sale. The U.S. federal government and all states, except Massachusetts, have enacted legislation prohibiting the sale and distribution of gray market cigarettes. In addition, RJR Tobacco has taken legal action against certain distributors and retailers who engage in such practices. 95 Table of Contents RJR Tobacco expects to benefit from certain state legislative activity aimed at leveling the playing field between original participating manufacturers under the MSA and nonparticipating manufacturers under the MSA, referred to as NPMs. Forty six states have passed legislation to ensure NPMs are making required escrow payments. Under this legislation, a state would only permit distribution of brands by manufacturers who are deemed by the states to be MSA compliant. Failure to make escrow payments could result in the loss of an NPMs ability to sell tobacco products in a respective state. Early efforts to enact legislation, from 2001 to early 2002, resulted in a range of NPM laws, some containing only minimal requirements. However, once the National Association of Attorneys General, referred to as NAAG, became involved in the legislative initiative, model complementary NPM language was developed and introduced in the states where either no NPM laws existed or where existing laws needed to be amended to bring them in line with the model language. Additionally, 44 states have enacted legislation that closes a loophole in the MSA. The loophole allows NPMs that concentrate their sales in a single state, or a limited number of states, to recover most of the funds from their escrow accounts. To obtain the refunds, the manufacturers must establish that their escrow deposit was greater than the amount the state would have received had the manufacturer been a subsequent participating manufacturer under the MSA (i.e., the states allocable share). NAAG has endorsed adoption of the allocable share legislation needed to eliminate this loophole. Following a challenge by NPMs, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York has issued an order enjoining New York from enforcing allocable share legislation. It is possible that NPMs will challenge allocable share legislation passed in other states. Finally, four states, Alaska, Michigan, Minnesota and Utah, have enacted equity assessments on NPMs products. This legislative initiative has not been endorsed by NAAG, and one NPM has filed a challenge to the equity assessment in Michigan. Thirty five states by statute or court rule have limited, and several additional states are considering limiting, the amount of the bonds required to file an appeal of an adverse judgment in state court. The limitation on the amount of such bonds generally ranges from $25 million to $150 million. Such bonding statutes allow defendants that are subject to large adverse judgments, such as cigarette manufacturers, to reasonably bond such judgments and pursue the appellate process. In six other jurisdictions, the filing of a notice of appeal automatically stays the judgment of the trial court. On May 21, 2003, the World Health Organization adopted a broad tobacco control treaty. The treaty recommends and requires enactment of legislation establishing specific actions to prevent youth smoking, restrict and gradually eliminate tobacco products marketing, provide greater regulation and disclosure of ingredients, increase the size and scope of package warning labels to cover at least 30% of each package and include graphic pictures on packages. The treaty entered into force on February 27, 2005 90 days after ratification by the 40th country. In February 2006, the first session of the Conference of the Parties, referred to as the COP, occurred in Geneva, Switzerland. The COP, among other actions taken, established a permanent secretariat, adopted a budget, and created working groups to begin to develop protocols on cross border advertising and illegal trade and guidelines on establishing smoke free places and regulating tobacco products. Although the U.S. delegate to the World Health Organization voted for the treaty in May 2003, and the Secretary for Health and Human Services signed the document in May 2004, it is not known whether the treaty will be sent to the U.S. Senate for ratification. Ratification of the treaty by the United States could lead to broader regulation of the industry. It is not possible to determine what additional federal, state or local legislation or regulations relating to smoking or cigarettes will be enacted or to predict the effect of new legislation or regulations on RJR Tobacco or the cigarette industry in general, but any new legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on RJR Tobacco or the cigarette industry in general. Similarly, it is not possible to determine what additional federal, state or local legislation or regulations relating to smokeless tobacco products will be enacted or to predict the effect of new regulation on Conwood or smokeless tobacco products in general, but any new legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on Conwood or smokeless tobacco products in general. Tobacco Buyout Legislation On October 22, 2004, the President signed the Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act of 2004, referred to as FETRA, eliminating the U.S. governments tobacco production controls and price support program. The buyout of 96 Table of Contents tobacco quota holders provided for in FETRA is funded by a direct quarterly assessment on every tobacco product manufacturer and importer, on a market share basis measured on volume to which federal excise tax is applied. The aggregate cost of the buyout to the industry is approximately $9.9 billion, including approximately $9.6 billion payable to quota tobacco holders and growers through industry assessments over ten years and approximately $290 million for the liquidation of quota tobacco stock. As a result of the tobacco buyout legislation, the MSA Phase II obligations established in 1999 will be continued as scheduled through the end of 2010, but will be offset against the tobacco quota buyout obligations. RAIs operating subsidiaries annual expense under FETRA, excluding the tobacco stock liquidation assessment, is estimated to be approximately $230 million to $280 million. RAIs operating subsidiaries incurred $81 million in 2005 related to assessments from quota tobacco stock liquidation. In the first quarter of 2006, a $9 million favorable adjustment was recorded relating to the tobacco stock liquidation assessment. Remaining contingent liabilities for liquidation of quota tobacco stock, if any, will be recorded when an assessment is made. See note 1 to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to federal tobacco buyout expenses. RAIs operating subsidiaries will record the FETRA assessment on a quarterly basis upon required notification of assessments. RAIs operating subsidiaries estimate that their overall share of the buyout will approximate $2.4 billion to $2.9 billion prior to the deduction of permitted offsets under the MSA. In addition, future market pricing could impact the carrying value of inventory, and adversely affect RJR Tobaccos financial condition and results of operations. Environmental Matters RAI and its subsidiaries are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge, storage, handling and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances. Such laws and regulations provide for significant fines, penalties and liabilities, sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of, or was responsible for, the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances. In addition, third parties may make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of hazardous or toxic substances. In the past, RJR Tobacco has been named a potentially responsible party with third parties under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act with respect to several superfund sites. RAI and its subsidiaries are not aware of any current environmental matters that are expected to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of RAI or its subsidiaries. Regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and other governmental agencies under various statutes have resulted in, and likely will continue to result in, substantial expenditures for pollution control, waste treatment, plant modification and similar activities. RAI and its subsidiaries are engaged in a continuing program to comply with federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, and dependent upon the probability of occurrence and reasonable estimation of cost, accrue or disclose any material liability. Although it is difficult to reasonably estimate the portion of capital expenditures or other costs attributable to compliance with environmental laws and regulations, RAI does not expect such expenditures or other costs to have a material adverse effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of RAI or its subsidiaries.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. RAI and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to their normal investing and funding activities. In addition, RAI and its subsidiaries have exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk concerning obligations for, and service agreements related to, foreign operations denominated in Euros, British Pounds and Swiss Francs. RAI and its subsidiaries have established policies and procedures to manage their exposure to market risks and use major creditworthy institutions as counterparties to minimize their investment and credit risk. Frequently, these institutions are also 98 Table of Contents members of the bank group that provide RAI credit and management believes this further minimizes the risk of nonperformance. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes. The table below provides information about RAIs financial instruments, as of December 31, 2006, that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates for the years ending December 31: Fair 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Value(1) Investments: Fixed Rate $ 405 $ 405 $ 405 Average Interest Rate 5.5 % 5.5 % Variable Rate $ 2,321 $ 2,321 $ 2,321 Average Interest Rate 5.3 % 5.3 % Debt: Fixed Rate $ 329 $ 200 $ 300 $ 2,360 $ 3,189 $ 3,319 Average Interest Rate(2) 6.7 % 7.9 % 6.5 % 7.5 % 7.3 % Variable Rate $ 15 $ 15 $ 15 $ 15 $ 15 $ 1,467 $ 1,542 $ 1,554 Average Interest Rate(2) 6.9 % 6.8 % 6.8 % 6.9 % 6.9 % 7.0 % 7.0 % Swaps: Notional Amount(3) $ 300 $ 450 $ 750 $ 15 Average Variable Interest Pay Rate(2) 6.5 % 6.6 % 6.6 % Average Fixed Interest Receive Rate(2) 6.5 % 7.3 % 7.0 % (1) Fair values are based on current market rates available or on rates available for instruments with similar terms and maturities and quoted market values.
