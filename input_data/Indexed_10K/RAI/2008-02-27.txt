Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following is a discussion and analysis of RAIs business, initiatives, critical accounting policies and its consolidated results of operations and financial position. Following the overview and discussion of business initiatives, the critical accounting policies disclose certain accounting policies that are material to RAIs results of operations and financial position for the periods presented in this report. The discussion and analysis of RAIs results of operations is presented in two comparative sections, 2007 compared with 2006, and 2006 compared with 2005. Disclosures related to liquidity and financial position complete managements discussion and analysis. You should read this discussion and analysis of RAIs consolidated financial position and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, and for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2007. Overview and Business Initiatives RAIs reportable operating segments are RJR Tobacco and Conwood. RJR Tobacco consists of the primary operations of R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. Conwood consists of the Conwood companies and Lane. RAIs wholly owned operating subsidiaries Santa Fe and GPI, among others, are included in All Other. RAIs largest reportable operating segment, RJR Tobacco, is the second largest cigarette manufacturer in the United States. RJR Tobaccos largest selling cigarette brands, CAMEL, KOOL, PALL MALL, DORAL and WINSTON, are currently five of the ten best selling brands of cigarettes in the United States. Those brands, and its other brands, including SALEM, MISTY and CAPRI, are manufactured in a variety of styles and marketed in the United States to meet a range of adult smoker preferences. RJR Tobacco also manages contract manufacturing of cigarette and tobacco products through arrangements with BAT affiliates. On January 1, 2007, the management and distribution of DUNHILL and STATE EXPRESS 555 cigarette brands were transferred from Lane to RJR Tobacco. On January 1, 2008, the management of RJR Tobaccos super premium brands, including DUNHILL and STATE EXPRESS 555, was transferred to Santa Fe. Also on January 1, 2008, the contract manufacturing business of GPI transferred to RJR Tobacco. RAIs other reportable operating segment, Conwood is the second largest smokeless tobacco products manufacturer in the United States. RAI acquired the Conwood companies on May 31, 2006. Conwoods primary brands include its largest selling moist snuff brands, GRIZZLY and KODIAK, two of the six best selling brands of moist snuff in the United States, and LEVI GARRETT, a loose leaf brand. Conwoods other products include dry snuff, plug and twist tobacco products, which currently hold the first or second position in market share in each category. On January 1, 2007, as a result of combining certain operations of Lane with the Conwood companies, Conwood began distributing a variety of other tobacco products, including WINCHESTER and CAPTAIN BLACK little cigars, and BUGLER roll your own tobacco. The remaining operations of Lane also are included in the Conwood segment. Santa Fe manufactures and markets cigarettes and other tobacco products under the NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand. GPI manufactures and exports tobacco products to U.S. territories, U.S. duty free shops and U.S. overseas military bases. In addition, GPI sells a limited portfolio of American blend cigarette brands in Italy, France and Spain. On January 1, 2007, GPI began managing the international businesses of Conwood and Santa Fe. 25 Table of Contents RJR Tobacco RJR Tobacco primarily conducts business in the highly competitive U.S. cigarette market, which has a few large manufacturers and many smaller participants. The U.S. cigarette market is a mature market in which overall consumer demand has declined since 1981 and is expected to continue to decline. Trade inventory adjustments may result in short term changes in demand for RJR Tobaccos products when wholesale and retail tobacco distributors adjust the timing of their purchases of product to manage their inventory levels. RJR Tobacco believes it is not appropriate for it to speculate on other external factors that may impact the purchasing decisions of the wholesale and retail tobacco distributors. At the beginning of 2007, RJR Tobacco refined its brand portfolio strategy and modified its then existing brand categories to growth, support and non support categories. The growth brands consist of two premium brands, CAMEL and KOOL, and a value brand, PALL MALL. Although all of these brands are managed for long term market share and profit growth, CAMEL and KOOL will continue to receive the most significant levels of investment support. The support brands include three premium brands, WINSTON, SALEM and CAPRI, and two value brands, DORAL and MISTY, all of which receive limited marketing support. The remaining non support brands are managed to maximize near term profitability. RJR Tobacco expects this focused portfolio strategy will result in growth in total RJR Tobacco share, as gains on growth brands more than offset declines among other brands. Competition is based primarily on brand positioning, including price, product attributes and packaging, consumer loyalty, promotions, advertising and retail presence. Cigarette brands produced by the major manufacturers generally require competitive pricing, substantial marketing support, retail programs and other incentives to maintain or improve market position or to introduce a new brand style. Most recently, competition among the major manufacturers has broadened to include a new smokeless, spitless category, known as snus. Snus is pasteurized tobacco that is currently sold in a small pouch that provides discreet and convenient tobacco consumption. Other cigarette manufacturers and smokeless tobacco manufacturers also are testing products in this new category. RJR Tobacco is expanding snus into additional markets in the first half of 2008. RJR Tobacco is committed to building and maintaining a portfolio of profitable brands. RJR Tobaccos marketing programs are designed to strengthen brand image, build brand awareness and loyalty and switch adult smokers of competing brands to RJR Tobacco brands. In addition to building strong brand equity, RJR Tobaccos marketing approach utilizes a retail pricing strategy, including discounting at retail, to defend certain brands shares of market against competitive pricing pressure. RJR Tobaccos competitive pricing methods include list price changes, discounting programs, such as retail buydowns, free product promotions and consumer coupons. Retail buydowns refer to payments made to the retailer to reduce the price that consumers pay at retail. Consumer coupons are distributed by a variety of methods, including in, or on, the cigarette pack and by direct mail. Free product promotions include offers such as Buy 2 packs, Get 1 pack free. Conwood Conwood offers a range of differentiated smokeless and other tobacco products to adult consumers. Conwood has offerings in the following smokeless tobacco markets: moist snuff, loose leaf, dry snuff, plug and twist tobacco. The moist snuff category is divided into premium and price value brands. The moist snuff category has become increasingly sophisticated in recent years and has developed many of the characteristics of the larger cigarette market, including multiple pricing tiers with intense competition, focused marketing programs and significant product innovation. In contrast to the declining U.S. cigarette market, U.S. moist snuff volumes grew 7% in 2007 and have grown at an average rate of approximately 5% per year over the last four years, driven by the accelerated growth of price value brands. Profit margins on moist snuff products are generally higher than on cigarette products. Moist snuffs growth is partially attributable to cigarette smokers switching from cigarettes to smokeless tobacco products or using both. Within the moist snuff category, premium brands have lost market share to price value brands, led by GRIZZLY, in recent years. 26 Table of Contents Moist snuff has been the key driver to Conwoods overall growth and profitability within the U.S. smokeless tobacco market. Moist snuff accounted for approximately 60% of Conwoods revenue in 2007 and 2006. Conwoods key brands include KODIAK in the premium brand category and GRIZZLY in the price value brand category. Conwoods U.S. moist snuff market share was 26.0% in 2007 and 25.1% in 2006 based on distributor reported data processed by MSAi, for distributor shipments to retail. Although moist snuff volume grew 7% in 2007, Conwoods moist snuff volume grew 11% in 2007, attributable to its innovation, product development and brand building. GRIZZLY brand moist snuff had a 21.1% market share in 2007, up from 19.4% market share in 2006. Conwood faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco categories. Similar to the cigarette market, competition is based primarily on brand positioning and price, as well as product attributes and packaging, consumer loyalty, promotions, advertising and retail presence. Recently, a cigarette manufacturer began testing moist snuff products. In January 2007, certain operations of Lane were combined with the Conwood companies and Conwood began distributing a variety of other tobacco products, including WINCHESTER and CAPTAIN BLACK little cigars and BUGLER roll your own tobacco. The remaining operations of Lane also are included in the Conwood segment. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, referred to as GAAP, require estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the reported amounts in RAIs consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Some of these estimates require difficult, subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and as a result, actual results could differ from those estimates. Due to the estimation processes involved, the following summarized accounting policies and their application are considered to be critical to understanding the business operations, financial position and results of operations of RAI and its subsidiaries. For information related to these and other significant accounting policies, see Item 8, note 1 to consolidated financial statements. Litigation RAI discloses information concerning litigation for which an unfavorable outcome is more than remote. RAI and its subsidiaries record their legal expenses and other litigation costs and related administrative costs as selling, general and administrative expenses as those costs are incurred. RAI and its subsidiaries will record any loss related to litigation at such time as an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate is a range, the recorded loss will be the best estimate within the range. If no amount in the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount of the range will be recorded. As discussed in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements, RJR Tobacco, the Conwood companies and their affiliates, including RAI, and indemnitees, have been named in a number of tobacco related legal actions, proceedings or claims seeking damages in amounts ranging into the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. Unfavorable judgments have been returned in a number of tobacco related cases and state enforcement actions. As of February 8, 2008, RJR Tobacco had paid approximately $41 million since January 1, 2005, related to unfavorable judgments, including pre acquisition contingencies related to the BW business combination. As discussed in more detail in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements, in 2007, RJR Tobacco accrued $6 million related to unfavorable judgments in two individual plaintiffs cases tried in conjunction with the Engle v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. case. This amount is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the RAI consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. Subject to the foregoing paragraph, RAI and its subsidiaries believe, however, that they have valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against them and have valid defenses to all actions and intend to defend all actions vigorously. Except for the unfavorable judgments described in the preceding paragraph, RAIs management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees, including BW, or the loss of any particular claim concerning the use of smokeless tobacco against the Conwood companies, when viewed on an individual basis, is not probable or estimable. In addition to the $6 million accrual discussed above, which was paid on February 8, 2008, RJR has liabilities totaling $94 million that were recorded in 1999 in connection with certain indemnification claims, not 27 Table of Contents related to smoking and health, asserted by JTI against RJR and RJR Tobacco, relating to the activities of Northern Brands and related litigation. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and it is possible that some of the tobacco related legal actions, proceedings or claims could ultimately be decided against RJR Tobacco, the Conwood companies or their affiliates, including RAI, and indemnitees. Any unfavorable outcome of such actions could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of RAI or its subsidiaries. Settlement Agreements RJR Tobacco, Santa Fe and Lane are participants in the Master Settlement Agreement, and RJR Tobacco is a participant in other state settlement agreements related to governmental health care cost recovery actions. Their obligations and the related expense charges under the MSA are subject to adjustments based upon, among other things, the volume of cigarettes sold by the operating subsidiaries, their relative market share and inflation. Since relative market share is based on cigarette shipments, the best estimate of the allocation of charges under these agreements is recorded in cost of products sold as the products are shipped. Adjustments to these estimates, which historically have not been significant, are recorded in the period that the change becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Conwood companies are not participants in the MSA. For more information related to historical and expected settlement expenses and payments under the MSA, see Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Health Care Cost Recovery Cases MSA and MSA Enforcement and Validity in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Intangible Assets Intangible assets include goodwill, trademarks and other intangibles and are accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, referred to as SFAS, No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The determination of fair value involves considerable estimates and judgment. In particular, the fair value of a reporting unit involves, among other things, developing forecasts of future cash flows, determining an appropriate discount rate, and when goodwill impairment is implied, determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities, including unrecorded intangibles. Although RAI believes it has based its impairment testing and impairment charges on reasonable estimates and assumptions, the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different results. Generally, if the current competitive environment worsens or RAIs operating companies strategic initiatives adversely affect their financial performance, the fair value of goodwill, trademarks and other intangibles could be impaired in future periods. See Item 8, note 3 to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment charges in connection with RAIs ongoing application of SFAS No. 142. Short Term Investments RAI holds short term investments in auction rate notes, mortgage backed securities, federal agency securities and treasury bills and notes. During 2007, adverse changes in financial markets caused certain auction rate notes and mortgage backed securities to revalue lower than carrying value and become less liquid. Beginning in the third quarter of 2007, the auction rate notes failed to auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders. The fair values of the auction rate notes and the mortgage backed securities were determined using pricing, projected future cash flows and credit ratings actions or valuation models that assessed the credit quality of the underlying collateral. The funds associated with these auction rate notes and mortgage backed securities will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs or a buyer is found. RAI intends, and has the ability, to hold these auction rate notes and mortgage backed securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in fair value. These investments will be evaluated on a quarterly basis. RAI reviews impairments associated with the above in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, and FASB Staff Position FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary. RAI considers those investments to be temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2007, with the unrealized loss included in accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2007. Such unrealized loss did not reduce net income for the year ended December 31, 2007. 28 Table of Contents Pension and Postretirement Benefits RAI and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor a number of non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering most of their employees, and also provide certain health and life insurance benefits for most of their retired employees and their dependents. These benefits are generally no longer provided to employees hired on or after January 1, 2004. For additional information relating to pension and postretirement benefits, see Item 8, note 17 to consolidated financial statements. Pension and postretirement expenses and reporting are determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, SFAS No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions and SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). Because pension and other postretirement obligations ultimately will be settled in future periods, the determination of annual expense and liabilities is subject to estimates and assumptions. RAI reviews these assumptions annually based on historic experience and expected future trends or coincidentally with a major event and modifies them as needed. Demographic assumptions such as termination of employment, mortality or retirement are reviewed periodically as expectations change. Gains or losses are annual changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions. The minimum amortization of unrecognized gains or losses, as described in SFAS No. 87, is included in pension expense. Prior service costs, which are changes in benefit obligations due to plan amendments, are amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period for active employees, or average remaining life expectancies for inactive employees if most of the plan obligations are due to inactive employees. The minimum amortization of unrecognized gains or losses, as described in SFAS No. 106, is also included in the postretirement benefit expense. Prior service costs, which are changes in benefit obligations due to plan amendments, are amortized on a straight line basis over the service to expected full eligibility age for active employees, or average remaining life expectancies for inactive employees if most of the plan obligations are due to inactive employees. Differences between actual results and actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods. In recent years, actual results have varied significantly from actuarial assumptions. In particular, pension and postretirement liabilities have decreased as a result of the increase in the discount rate. These changes have resulted in a reduction in charges to comprehensive loss. These changes are expected to result in a reduction in pension and postretirement expense in future years. The Pension Protection Act may require additional cash funding of the pension obligations in the future. The most critical assumptions and their sensitivity to change are presented below: Assumed asset return and discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the benefit plans. A one percentage point change in assumed discount rate for the pension plans and other postretirement plans would have had the following effects: 1 Percentage Point Increase 1 Percentage Point Decrease Pension Postretirement Pension Postretirement Plans Plans Plans Plans Effect on 2007 net periodic benefit cost $ (22 ) $ (4 ) $ 11 $ 3 Effect on December 31, 2007, projected benefit obligation and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (512 ) (136 ) 572 150 A one percentage point change in assumed asset return would have had the following effects: 1 Percentage Point Increase 1 Percentage Point Decrease Pension Postretirement Pension Postretirement Plans Plans Plans Plans Effect on 2007 net periodic benefit cost $ (50 ) $ (3 ) $ 50 $ 3 29 Table of Contents Income Taxes Tax law requires certain items to be included in taxable income at different times than is required for book reporting purposes under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. These differences may be permanent or temporary in nature. FIN No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, clarifies SFAS No. 109 by providing guidance for consistent reporting of uncertain income tax positions recognized in a companys financial statements. RAI determines its annual effective income tax rate based on forecasted pre tax book income and forecasted permanent book and tax differences. The rate is established at the beginning of the year and is evaluated on a quarterly basis. Any changes to the forecasted information may cause the effective rate to be adjusted. Additional tax, interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in tax expense on a quarterly basis. To the extent that any book and tax differences are temporary in nature, that is, the book realization will occur in a different period than the tax realization, a deferred tax asset or liability is established as required under SFAS No. 109. To the extent that a deferred tax asset is created, management evaluates RAIs ability to realize this asset. Management currently believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets recorded in RAIs consolidated balance sheets will be realized. To the extent a deferred tax liability is established under SFAS No. 109, it is recorded, tracked and, once it becomes currently due and payable, paid to the taxing authorities. The financial statements reflect managements best estimate of RAIs current and deferred tax liabilities and assets. Future events, including but not limited to, additional resolutions with taxing authorities could have an impact on RAIs current estimate of tax liabilities, realization of tax assets and upon RAIs effective income tax rate. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurement. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but provides a definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for RAI as of January 1, 2008. In February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, referred to as FSP 157 2. FSP 157 2 delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, that are not remeasured at fair value on a recurring basis until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008, and interim periods within those fiscal years. FSP 157 2 is effective for RAI as of January 1, 2009. The adoption of SFAS 157 on financial assets and liabilities will not have a material impact on RAIs consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. SFAS No. 159 permits all entities to choose to elect to measure eligible financial instruments at fair value. RAI does not expect to elect to measure any eligible financial instruments at fair value upon adoption of SFAS No. 159 on January 1, 2008. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS No. 160 is an amendment to ARB No. 51 Consolidated Financial Statements and clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements. SFAS No. 160 is effective for RAI as of January 1, 2009. RAI has not yet determined the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 160 on its consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141(revised 2007), Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) replaces SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and provides requirements related to an acquiring entitys recognition and measurement of all assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including any contingent consideration, pre acquisition contingencies and noncontrolling interests, as well as treatment of acquisition related transaction and restructuring costs. SFAS No. 141(R) also requires enhanced disclosures regarding the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for RAI for business combinations completed on or after January 1, 2009, and its impact will be dependent on its acquisitions, if any, made after that date. 30 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2007 Compared with 2006 For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Change Net sales:(1) RJR Tobacco $ 7,918 $ 7,708 2.7 % Conwood 670 409 NM (3) All other 435 393 10.7 % Net sales 9,023 8,510 6.0 % Cost of products sold(1),(2) 4,960 4,803 3.3 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,687 1,658 1.7 % Amortization expense 23 28 (17.9 )% Restructuring and asset impairment charges 1 NM (3) Goodwill and trademark impairment charges 65 90 (27.8 )% Operating income: RJR Tobacco 1,934 1,693 14.2 % Conwood 312 181 NM (3) All other 148 154 (3.9 )% Corporate expense (106 ) (98 ) 8.2 % $ 2,288 $ 1,930 18.5 % (1) Excludes excise taxes of: 2007 2006 RJR Tobacco $ 1,850 $ 1,971 Conwood 18 13 All other 158 140 $ 2,026 $ 2,124 (2) See below for further information related to MSA settlement and federal tobacco buyout expense included in cost of products sold. (3) Percentage change is not meaningful. RJR Tobacco Net Sales RJR Tobaccos net sales for the year ended 2007 increased $210 million from the comparable prior year, primarily due to higher pricing coupled with lower discounting, partially offset by the impact of total volume decrease of $479 million. RJR Tobaccos net sales are dependent upon its shipment volume in a declining market, premium versus value brand mix and list pricing, offset by promotional spending, trade incentives and federal excise taxes. 31 Table of Contents Domestic shipment volume, in billions of units for RJR Tobacco and the industry, were as follows(1): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Change Growth brands: CAMEL excluding non filter 24.2 23.5 3.1 % KOOL 11.1 11.7 (5.3 )% PALL MALL 7.1 6.4 10.3 % 42.4 41.6 1.9 % Support brands 40.9 44.1 (7.2 )% Non support brands 14.4 18.3 (20.9 )% Total domestic 97.8 104.0 (6.0 )% Total premium 61.0 64.0 (4.7 )% Total value 36.7 40.0 (8.1 )% Premium/Total mix 62.4 % 61.6 % Industry(2): Premium 259.9 270.4 (3.9 )% Value 97.3 105.6 (7.9 )% Total domestic 357.2 376.0 (5.0 )% Premium/Total mix 72.8 % 71.9 % (1) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. (2) Based on information from MSAi. Prior year amounts have been restated to reflect current methodology. RJR Tobaccos total domestic shipment volume decreased 6.0% in 2007 compared with the prior year, reflecting both a decline in total cigarette consumption and a decline in market share. RJR Tobaccos premium shipments as a percentage of total shipments increased during 2007 compared with the prior year, driven by CAMEL. CAMEL continues to provide innovation with CAMEL No. 9 and CAMEL Signature Blends, which were introduced during the first half of 2007, and the expansion to national distribution of two new CAMEL No. 9 styles in the third quarter of 2007. CAMELs menthol styles have increased in popularity in 2007 as well. Another innovation, CAMEL Snus, continues to pioneer the development of a new category of smokeless, spitless tobacco products. RJR Tobacco has expanded its initial CAMEL Snus two market test into six additional markets and is expanding into additional markets in the first half of 2008. 32 Table of Contents The shares of RJR Tobaccos brands as a percentage of total share of U.S. retail cigarette sales according to data(1) from IRI, were as follows: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31,(2) Share Point 2007 2006 Change Growth brands: CAMEL excluding non filter 7.8 % 7.4 % 0.4 KOOL 3.1 % 3.1 % PALL MALL 2.1 % 1.9 % 0.3 Total growth brands 13.0 % 12.4 % 0.6 Support brands 11.6 % 12.1 % (0.5 ) Non support brands 4.4 % 5.3 % (0.8 ) Total domestic 29.0 % 29.8 % (0.7 ) (1) Retail share of U.S. cigarette sales data is included in this document because it is used by RJR Tobacco primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants, and brands and market trends. You should not rely on the market share data reported by IRI as being a precise measurement of actual market share because IRI is not able to effectively track all volume. Moreover, you should be aware that in a product market experiencing overall declining consumption, a particular product can experience increasing market share relative to competing products, yet still be subject to declining consumption volumes. (2) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. The retail share of market of CAMELs filtered styles increased 0.4 share points in 2007 from 2006. CAMEL continues to focus on brand innovation. In the first half of 2007, CAMEL introduced CAMEL Signature Blends, a collaborative effort with adult smokers. Also in the first half of 2007, CAMEL introduced CAMEL No. 9 in regular and menthol styles designed to appeal to adult female smokers. CAMEL No. 9, 100mm styles, were introduced during the third quarter of 2007. KOOLs market share in 2007 was stable compared with 2006 despite intense competition in the menthol market and above average price increases. KOOL has been providing innovative products such as KOOL XL, the smoother and wider cigarette introduced in late 2006 and, most recently, a milder style, KOOL XL Blue. Both KOOL XL and KOOL XL Blue were expanded to national distribution during 2007. PALL MALLs market share continues to grow, gaining 0.3 share points in 2007 over 2006. PALL MALL offers a longer lasting cigarette with a premium heritage at a less than premium price. During 2007, PALL MALL ultra lights were introduced in a bright, distinctive packaging design. The combined share of market of RJR Tobaccos growth brands during 2007 showed improvement over the prior year. However, as expected, the decline in share of support and non support brands more than offset the gains on the growth brands. Operating Income RJR Tobaccos operating income for the year ended 2007 increased $241 million to $1,934 million, or 24.4% of net sales, from $1,693 million, or 22.0% of net sales for the year ended 2006. Improvements in pricing, product mix, productivity and pension expense were partially offset by increased MSA settlement payments and volume declines during 2007. In connection with the annual impairment testing of goodwill and certain intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2007, impairment of $33 million occurred on RJR Tobaccos non growth brand, WINSTON. The impairment primarily reflects lower projected net sales compared with that assumed in the 2006 annual impairment test. The impairment charge was based on the excess of the brands carrying value over its fair value using the present value of estimated future cash flows assuming a discount rate of 10.5%. 33 Table of Contents RJR Tobaccos MSA settlement and federal tobacco buyout expenses, included in cost of products sold, are detailed in the schedule below: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Settlements $ 2,796 $ 2,589 Federal tobacco quota buyout 247 258 Federal quota tobacco stock liquidation assessment (9 ) Total quota buyout expense $ 247 $ 249 MSA settlement expenses are expected to be approximately $2.8 billion in 2008, subject to adjustment for changes in volume and other factors, and the federal tobacco quota buyout is expected to be approximately $250 million to $260 million in 2008. For additional information, see Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Health Care Cost Recovery Cases MSA in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements and Governmental Activity below. Selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs of litigating and administering product liability claims, as well as other legal expenses. For the year ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, RJR Tobaccos product liability defense costs were $88 million and $105 million, respectively. An improved litigation environment and efficient and effective management of cost contributed to the decline in product liability cost in 2007. Product liability cases generally include the following types of smoking and health related cases: Individual Smoking and Health; Engle Progeny; Broin II; Class Actions; and Health Care Cost Recovery Claims. Product liability defense costs include the following items: direct and indirect compensation, fees and related costs and expenses for internal legal and related administrative staff administering product liability claims; fees and cost reimbursements paid to outside attorneys; direct and indirect payments to third party vendors for litigation support activities; expert witness costs and fees; and payments to fund legal defense costs for the now dissolved Council for Tobacco Research U.S.A. Numerous factors affect the amount of product liability defense costs. The most important factors are the number of cases pending and the number of cases in trial or in preparation for trial (that is, with active discovery and motions practice). See Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Overview in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements for detailed information regarding the number and type of cases pending, and Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Scheduled Trials in Item 8, note 14 for detailed information regarding the number and nature of cases in trial and scheduled for trial through December 31, 2008. RJR Tobacco expects that the factors described above will continue to have the primary impact on its product liability defense costs in the future. Given the level of activity in cases in preparation for trial, in trial and on appeal, and the amount of product liability defense costs incurred by RJR Tobacco over the past three years, RJR Tobaccos recent experiences in defending its product liability cases, and the reasonably anticipated level of activity in RJR Tobaccos pending cases and possible new cases, RJR Tobacco does not expect that the variances in its product liability defense costs will be significantly different than they have been historically, aside from the assumption of 34 Table of Contents certain BW litigation and increased individual case filings in Florida due to the Engle decision. See Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Engle Progeny Cases and Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Class Action Suits Engle Case in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements for additional information. However, it is possible that adverse developments in the factors discussed above, as well as other circumstances beyond the control of RJR Tobacco, could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows of RAI or its subsidiaries. Those other circumstances beyond the control of RJR Tobacco include the results of present and future trials and appeals, and the development of possible new theories of liability by plaintiffs and their counsel. Conwood Net Sales Conwoods net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $670 million compared with $409 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The acquisition of the Conwood companies occurred on May 31, 2006, and consequently, the RAI consolidated statements of income include only the results of operations of the Conwood companies subsequent to May 31, 2006. Additionally, prior year comparative results of Lane operations that were transferred to Conwood on January 1, 2007, have been reclassified. The shares of Conwoods moist snuff products and volume discussion presented below include periods prior to the acquisition by RAI for enhanced analysis. The shipment volume, in millions of cans, for Conwood was as follows: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31,(1) 2007 2006 % Change Premium: KODIAK 53.2 56.7 (6.2 )% Other 3.2 3.5 (8.6 )% 56.4 60.2 (6.3 )% Price value: GRIZZLY 237.0 202.1 17.3 % Other 2.2 3.1 (29.0 )% 239.2 205.2 16.6 % Total moist snuff 295.6 265.4 11.4 % (1) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. 35 Table of Contents The Conwood shares of the moist snuff category as a percentage of total share of U.S. shipments of moist snuff, according to distributor reported data1 processed by MSAi, were as follows: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31,(2) Share 2007 2006 Point Change Premium: KODIAK 4.5 % 5.1 % (0.6 ) Other 0.2 % 0.3 % (0.1 ) 4.7 % 5.4 % (0.7 ) Price value: GRIZZLY 21.1 % 19.4 % 1.7 Other 0.2 % 0.3 % (0.1 ) 21.3 % 19.7 % 1.6 Total moist snuff 26.0 % 25.1 % 0.9 (1) Distributor shipments to retail share of U.S. moist snuff is included in this document because it is used by Conwood primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants, and brands and market trends. You should not rely on the market share data reported by distributors and processed by MSAi as being a precise measurement of actual market share because this distributor data set is not able to effectively track all volume. (2) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. GRIZZLY, Conwoods leading price value moist snuff brand, had a market share of 21.1% of moist snuff shipments for 2007, an increase of 1.7 points from the prior year. Conwood completed its national roll out of GRIZZLY Long Cut Natural in the second quarter of 2007 and began testing two new GRIZZLY styles, GRIZZLY Pouches and GRIZZLY Snuff, to build on the brands momentum. GRIZZLY Pouches are moist snuff in a fleece pouch, and GRIZZLY Snuff is a traditional moist snuff style with an ultra fine cut. The shipment share of KODIAK, Conwoods leading premium moist snuff brand, was adversely impacted compared with the prior year due to competitive discounting and promotions. Operating Income Conwoods operating income for the year ended December 31, 2007, increased to $312 million, or 46.5% of net sales, from $181 million, or 44.4% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2006. A full year of the Conwood companies activities is the primary driver of the year over year increase. In addition, Conwood also benefited from higher volume and higher prices in 2007. In connection with the annual impairment testing of goodwill and certain intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2007, impairment occurred on five of Conwoods non investment brands. The impairment primarily reflects a shift in the level of support among loose leaf product brands and for little cigar brands. In 2007, Conwood recorded impairment charges of $32 million based on the excess of certain brands carrying values over their fair values, using the present value of estimated future cash flows assuming a discount rate of 10.5%. All Other All Other sales in 2007 were favorably impacted by the growth of Santa Fes NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand. Operating income was unfavorably impacted by an increase in corporate expenses as well as an increase in selling expenses associated with an increase in Santa Fes sales force. 36 Table of Contents RAI Consolidated Interest and debt expense was $338 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $68 million over the comparable prior year. This increase was primarily due to a full year of interest on the debt incurred by RAI to fund the acquisition of the Conwood companies in May 2006. Other expense (income) net was expense of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Year to date foreign exchange gains and equity income were more than offset by the expensing of unamortized debt fees associated with the term loan that RAI pre paid in full in June 2007 and the loss on the sale of investment securities. For the year ended December 31, 2006, other income was $13 million consisting primarily of foreign exchange gain and equity income. Provision for income taxes was $766 million, or an effective rate of 37.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $673 million, or 37.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2006. The 2007 provision was favorably impacted by a decrease in nondeductible items and an increase in the Qualified Production Activity Income deduction. The 2006 provision was adversely impacted by nondeductible items, including certain expenditures related to ballot initiatives, offset by the resolution of certain prior years tax matters that resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of $17 million. RAI expects its effective tax rate to be approximately 38% in 2008. Extraordinary item included a gain of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, and $74 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, related to the 2000 acquisition of RJRs former parent, NGH, primarily from settlement of tax matters. Including these adjustments, the net after tax gain on the acquisition of NGH was $1.8 billion. 2006 Compared with 2005 For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2006 2005 % Change Net sales:(1) RJR Tobacco $ 7,708 $ 7,723 (0.2 )% Conwood(2) 409 152 NM (4) All other 393 381 (3.1 )% Net sales 8,510 8,256 3.1 % Cost of products sold(1),(3) 4,803 4,919 (2.4 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,658 1,611 2.9 % Amortization expense 28 41 (31.7 )% Loss on sale of assets 24 NM (4) Restructuring and asset impairment charges 1 2 (50.0 )% Goodwill and trademark impairment charges 90 200 (55.0 )% Operating income: RJR Tobacco 1,693 1,399 21.0 % Conwood(2) 181 18 NM (4) All other 154 110 40.0 % Corporate expense (98 ) (68 ) (44.1 )% $ 1,930 $ 1,459 32.3 % 37 Table of Contents (1) Excludes excise taxes of: 2006 2005 RJR Tobacco $ 1,971 $ 2,045 Conwood 13 12 All other 140 118 $ 2,124 $ 2,175 (2) In addition to the results of operations of Lane, Conwoods net sales and operating income include results of operations of the Conwood companies for the months of June through December 2006. (3) See below for further information related to MSA settlement and federal tobacco buyout expense included in cost of products sold. (4) Percent change is not meaningful. RJR Tobacco Net Sales RJR Tobaccos net sales for the year ended 2006 decreased $15 million from the comparable prior year, primarily due to lower volumes of $268 million, offset in part by higher pricing resulting from a January 2006 price increase. Domestic shipment volume, in billions of units for RJR Tobacco and the industry, were as follows(1): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2006 2005 % Change Growth brands: CAMEL excluding non filter 23.5 22.0 6.5 % KOOL 11.7 11.8 (0.4 )% PALL MALL Savings 6.4 5.8 10.5 % 41.6 39.6 5.1 % Support brands 44.1 46.6 (5.5 )% Non support brands 18.3 21.1 (13.3 )% Total domestic 104.0 107.4 (3.2 )% Total premium 64.0 64.8 (1.2 )% Total value 40.0 42.6 (6.1 )% Industry(2) Premium 270.4 271.4 (0.4 )% Value 105.6 110.4 (4.3 )% Industry total domestic 376.0 381.7 (1.5 )% Premium/Total mix 61.5 % 60.4 % (1) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. (2) Based on information from MSAi. These amounts, including the restatement of prior periods, reflect MSAis revised methodology adopted to better estimate industry volume. 38 Table of Contents RJR Tobaccos total domestic shipment volume decreased 3.2% in 2006 compared with 2005 due to declines in consumption, or retail sales to consumers, and one less shipping day. The overall cigarette industry decline was 1.5%. The industrys premium shipments increased to 71.9% in 2006 from 71.1% in 2005. The shares of RJR Tobacco as a percentage of total share of U.S. retail cigarette sales according to data1 from IRI, were as follows: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31,(2),(3) Share Point 2006 2005 Change Growth brands: CAMEL excluding non filter 7.4 % 6.7 % 0.7 KOOL 3.1 % 3.0 % 0.1 PALL MALL Savings 1.9 % 1.6 % 0.3 12.4 % 11.3 % 1.1 Support brands 12.1 % 12.8 % (0.7 ) Non support brands 5.3 % 6.1 % (0.9 ) RJR Tobacco total domestic 29.8 % 30.3 % (0.5 ) (1) Retail share of U.S. cigarette sales data is included in this document because it is used by RJR Tobacco primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants and brands and market trends. You should not rely on the market share data reported by IRI as being a precise measurement of actual market share because IRI is not able to effectively track all volume. Moreover, you should be aware that in a product market experiencing overall declining consumption, a particular product can experience increasing market share relative to competing products, yet still be subject to declining consumption volumes. (2) These amounts, including the restatement of prior periods, reflect IRIs revised methodology adopted to better reflect industry dynamics. (3) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. In 2006 retail share of market of CAMELs filtered styles increased 0.7 share points from 2005. In the first quarter of 2006, CAMEL introduced new CAMEL Wides packaging and initiated efforts to enhance the performance of the brands menthol styles, including new packaging and introducing the CAMEL Wides Menthol style. Also in 2006, CAMEL introduced CAMEL Snus, a smokeless, spitless tobacco product, in test markets. KOOL continues to maintain its appeal among adult menthol smokers and had an increase in its retail share of market of 0.1 share points in 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2006, KOOL introduced KOOL XL, a wide gauge cigarette style, which provides another tangible point of difference from competing brands. PALL MALL increased its share of market by 0.3 share points in 2006 and continues to demonstrate its strength in the value category based on its unique product platform of being a longer lasting cigarette. The combined share of market of RJR Tobaccos growth brands grew 1.1 share points during 2006. However, the decline in share of support and non support brands more than offset the gains on the growth brands. RJR Tobaccos premium share position of 18.8% in 2006 increased 0.3 share points from 2005 due to the increase of its growth brands. RJR Tobaccos value share position of 11.0% of the market in 2006 declined 0.8 share points from 2005. 39 Table of Contents Operating Income RJR Tobaccos operating income for 2006 increased to $1,626 million from $1,346 million in 2005 primarily due to favorable pricing, and lower trademark impairment charges, offset in part by lower volumes and higher MSA and tobacco quota buyout expenses, detailed below. In connection with the annual impairment testing of goodwill and certain intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2006, impairment occurred on four of RJR Tobaccos non growth brands, primarily DORAL and SALEM. The impairment primarily reflects modification, during the fourth quarter of 2006, to the previously anticipated level of support among certain brands, and also results from increased decline rate in projected net sales of certain brands, compared with that assumed in the 2005 annual impairment test, which resulted in $198 million of trademark impairment charges. In 2006, RJR Tobacco recorded impairment charges of $90 million based on the excess of certain brands carrying values over their fair values using the present value of estimated future cash flows assuming a discount rate of 10.75%. The discount rate was determined by adjusting the RJR Tobacco enterprise discount rate by an appropriate risk premium to reflect an asset group risk. RJR Tobaccos operating income also was impacted by lower amortization expense of $13 million for the comparable periods, primarily due to certain acquired consumer related intangibles being fully amortized prior to 2006. RJR Tobaccos cost of products sold includes the following components for MSA settlements, and federal tobacco buyout expenses for the years ended December 31: 2006 2005 Settlement $ 2,589 $ 2,618 Phase II growers liability offset (79 ) Phase II growers liability expense 38 Total settlement expense $ 2,589 $ 2,577 Federal tobacco quota buyout $ 258 $ 259 Federal quota tobacco stock liquidation assessment (9 ) 79 Total quota buyout expense $ 249 $ 338 For additional information, see Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Health Care Cost Recovery Cases MSA in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements and Governmental Activity below. Merger and integration costs related to the BW business combination decreased during 2006 compared with 2005, favorably impacting cost of products sold by $14 million and selling, general and administrative expenses by $60 million. Selling, general and administrative expenses for RJR Tobacco also were impacted by a $48 million decrease in product liability defense costs during 2006 compared with the prior year period, offset by $46 million of expenditures relating to ballot initiatives in 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs of litigating and administering product liability claims, as well as other legal expenses. During 2006 and 2005, RJR Tobaccos product liability defense costs were $105 million and $153 million, respectively. The decrease in product liability defense costs in 2006 compared with 2005 was primarily due to reduced litigation activity, including a decrease in the number of cases tried or in trial during 2006 (2 cases) compared with 2005 (5 cases, including the U.S. Department of Justice case). Conwood The acquisition of the Conwood companies occurred on May 31, 2006, and consequently, the RAI consolidated statement of income includes only the results of operations of the Conwood companies for June through December 2006 and those of Lane reclassified into the Conwood segment. Conwoods net sales are dependent upon premium versus price value brand mix and list pricing, offset by promotional spending, trade incentives and federal excise taxes. Conwoods operating income of $181 million in 2006 includes $12 million of integration costs. 40 Table of Contents The shares of Conwoods moist snuff products and volume discussion presented below include periods prior to the acquisition by RAI for enhanced analysis. The Conwood shares of the moist snuff category as a percentage of total share of U.S. retail moist snuff sales, according to distributor reported data1 processed by MSAi, were as follows: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31,(2) Share Point 2006 2005 Change Moist snuff: Premium KODIAK 5.1 % 5.8 % (0.7 ) Other 0.3 % 0.4 % (0.1 ) 5.4 % 6.2 % (0.8 ) Price value GRIZZLY 19.4 % 16.0 % 3.4 Other 0.3 % 0.4 % (0.1 ) 19.7 % 16.4 % 3.3 Total moist snuff 25.1 % 22.7 % 2.5 (1) Distributor shipments to retail share of U.S. moist snuff is included in this document because it is used by Conwood primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants and brands and market trends. You should not rely on the market share data reported by distributors and processed by MSAi as being a precise measurement of actual market share because this distributor data set is not able to effectively track all volume. (2) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. GRIZZLYs growth led Conwoods share position to 25.1% of the moist snuff market in 2006, an increase of 2.5 share points from 2005. GRIZZLYs price value share position was 46.9% of that market in 2006, an increase of 4.2% from 2005. In 2006, Conwood introduced GRIZZLY Long Cut Natural in 20 states to further enhance GRIZZLYs growth potential. Conwoods total moist snuff shipment volume increased 18.4% in 2006 from 2005, including GRIZZLYs 29.1% volume growth. All Other All Other operating income for 2006 was favorably impacted by the growth of Santa Fes NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand. In addition, 2005 was impacted by the $24 million loss relating to the sale of the packaging operations. RAI Consolidated Interest and debt expense was $270 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $157 million from 2005. This increase was primarily due to higher debt balances resulting from the debt incurred by RAI to fund the acquisition of the Conwood companies in May 2006. Interest income was $136 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of $51 million from 2005. This increase was primarily due to higher interest rates and, to a lesser extent, higher average cash balances. Other (income) expense, net was $13 million income in 2006 compared with $15 million expense in 2005. The change was primarily due to favorable foreign exchange revaluation of $14 million and increased earnings relating to the joint venture, coupled with the 2005 net costs of $7 million related to the extinguishment of the 2006 notes. 41 Table of Contents Provision for income taxes was a provision of $673 million, or an effective rate of 37.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2006, compared with a provision of $431 million, or an effective rate of 30.4%, in 2005. The 2006 provision was adversely impacted by state taxes and nondeductible items, including certain expenditures relating to ballot initiatives, offset in part by the resolution of certain prior years tax matters that resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of $17 million. The 2005 provision was favorably impacted by the resolution of certain prior years tax matters that resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of $78 million, offset in part by state taxes and certain nondeductible items. Discontinued operations reflect transactions related to the 1999 sale of the international tobacco business to JTI. During 2005, these transactions included $2 million of after tax reversals of indemnification accruals. Including these adjustments, the net after tax gain on the sale of the international tobacco business was $2.5 billion. Extraordinary item included a gain of $74 million and $55 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively, related to the 2000 acquisition of RJRs former parent, NGH, primarily from settlement of tax matters. Including these adjustments, the net after tax gain on the acquisition was $1.8 billion. Liquidity and Financial Condition Liquidity At present, the principal sources of liquidity for RAIs operating subsidiaries businesses and operating needs are internally generated funds from their operations and borrowings through RAI and RJR. Cash flows from operating activities are believed to be sufficient for the foreseeable future to enable the operating subsidiaries to meet their obligations under the MSA, to fund their capital expenditures and to make dividend and other payments to RAI and RJR that, when combined with RAIs and RJRs cash balances, will enable RAI and RJR to make their required debt service payments, and enable RAI to pay dividends to its shareholders. RAI holds short term investments in auction rate notes, mortgage backed securities, federal agency securities and treasury bills and notes. During 2007, adverse changes in the financial markets caused certain auction rate notes and mortgage backed securities to revalue lower than carrying value and become less liquid. Beginning in the third quarter of 2007, the auction rate notes failed to auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders. The funds associated with these auction rate notes and mortgage backed securities will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs or a buyer is found. RAI intends, and has the ability, to hold these auction rate notes and mortgage backed securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for the anticipated recovery in fair value. RAI considers those investments to temporarily impaired as of December 31, 2007. The negative impact, if any, on the sources of liquidity that could result from a decrease in demand for products due to short term inventory adjustments by wholesale and retail distributors, changes in competitive pricing, accelerated declines in consumption or adverse impacts from financial markets, cannot be predicted. RAI cannot predict its cash requirements or those of its subsidiaries related to any future settlements or judgments, including cash required to be held in escrow or to bond any appeals, if necessary, and RAI makes no assurance that it or its subsidiaries will be able to meet all of those requirements. 42 Table of Contents Contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007 were as follows: Payments Due by Period Less than 1 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Total Year 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Long term notes, exclusive of interest(1) $ 4,410 $ $ 500 $ 850 $ 3,060 Interest payments related to long term notes(1) 2,617 287 546 458 1,326 Operating leases(2) 72 16 27 16 13 Non qualified pension obligations(3) 72 6 14 14 38 Postretirement benefit obligations(3) 809 79 160 164 406 Qualified pension funding(3) 1 1 Purchase obligations(4) 3,224 714 1,102 760 648 Other noncurrent liabilities(5) 66 N/A 52 3 11 MSA obligations(6) 14,110 2,830 5,580 5,700 Gross unrecognized tax benefit(7) 111 Federal tobacco buyout obligations(8) 1,820 260 520 520 520 Total cash obligations $ 27,312 $ 4,193 $ 8,501 $ 8,485 $ 6,022 (1) For more information about RAIs long term notes, see Debt below and Item 8, note 12 to consolidated financial statements.

Qualified pension plan funding is based on Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation requirements, the Pension Protection Act and tax deductibility and is not reasonably estimable beyond one year. (4) Purchase obligations include commitments to acquire tobacco leaf, leaf processing, direct materials, media services, capital expenditures and software maintenance. (5) Other noncurrent liabilities include primarily restructuring and bonus compensation. Certain other noncurrent liabilities are excluded from the table above, including RJRs liabilities recorded in 1999 related to certain indemnification claims, for which timing of payments are not estimable. For more information about RJRs indemnification obligations, see Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. (6) MSA obligation amounts in the aggregate beyond five years are not meaningful as these are obligations into perpetuity.

For more information, see Item 8, note 10 to consolidated financial statements. Due to inherent uncertainties regarding the timing of payment of these amounts, RAI cannot reasonably estimate the payment period. (8) For more information about the tobacco buyout legislation, see Governmental Activity below and Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Commitments as of December 31, 2007 were as follows: Commitment Expiration Period Less than Total 1 Year Standby letters of credit backed by revolving credit facility $ 22 $ 22 Total commitments $ 22 $ 22 43 Table of Contents Cash Flows 2007 Compared with 2006 Net cash flows from operating activities were $1.3 billion in 2007, compared with net cash flows from operating activities of $1.5 billion in 2006. This decrease was the result of higher income tax and interest payments in 2007, partially offset by increased net income in 2007. Net cash flows from investing activities were $763 million in 2007, compared with net cash flows used in investing activities of $3.5 billion in 2006. This change was primarily driven by the acquisition of the Conwood companies in 2006 and higher net proceeds from the sale of short term investments in 2007. Net cash flows used in financing activities were $1.3 billion in 2007, compared with net cash flows provided by financing activities of $2.2 billion in 2006. This change reflects prior year RAI debt issuances related to the acquisition of the Conwood companies, as well as increased dividend payments, long term debt repayment and repurchase of RAI common stock in 2007. 2006 Compared with 2005 Net cash flows from operating activities were $1.5 billion in 2006, compared with $1.3 billion in 2005. This increase was primarily due to an increase in net income of $98 million, excluding non cash charges and the receipt of an IRS tax refund in 2006, partially offset by higher pension funding and higher income taxes paid in 2006. Net cash flows for 2006 were also favorably impacted by the $178 million classification of certain book overdrafts as accounts payable compared with the 2005 classification in cash and cash equivalents, resulting from changes in certain banking relationships. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $3.5 billion in 2006, compared with $989 million in 2005. This change was primarily due to the acquisition of the Conwood companies for $3.5 billion, offset in part by lower net purchases of short term investments of $981 million. Net cash flows from financing activities were $2.2 billion in 2006, compared with net cash flows used in financing activities of $450 million in 2005. This change was primarily due to $3.2 billion in proceeds from RAIs debt issuances to fund the acquisition of the Conwood companies, and lower debt repayment, offset in part by higher dividends paid per share of common stock. Stock Repurchases On February 6, 2007, the board of directors of RAI authorized the repurchase by RAI of up to $75 million, of its outstanding shares of common stock to offset dilution from restricted stock grants and the exercise of previously granted options under the LTIP. Due to RAIs incorporation in North Carolina, which does not recognize treasury shares, the shares repurchased are cancelled at the time of repurchase. RAI also repurchases and cancels shares of its common stock forfeited with respect to the tax liability associated with certain option exercises and vesting of restricted stock grants under the LTIP. During 2007, RAI repurchased and cancelled 991,956 shares of its common stock at an aggregate cost of $60 million. On February 5, 2008, the board of directors of RAI authorized the repurchase by RAI of up to $30 million of its outstanding shares of common stock to offset dilution from restricted stock grants and the exercise of previously granted options under the LTIP. RAI continues to explore the potential for a share repurchase program as a way to return value to its shareholders. The decision to implement a share repurchase program, including the timing and amount of any such program, remains subject to BWs final agreement to participate on a pro rata basis, overall economic conditions, competitive activity and approval by RAIs board of directors. 44 Table of Contents Dividends On February 5, 2008, RAIs board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.85 per common share. The dividend will be paid on April 1, 2008, to shareholders of record as of March 10, 2008. On an annualized basis, the dividend rate is $3.40 per common share. The current dividend reflects RAIs policy of paying dividends to the holders of RAIs common stock in an aggregate amount that is approximately 75% of RAIs annual consolidated net income. Capital Expenditures RAIs operating subsidiaries recorded cash capital expenditures of $142 million, $136 million and $105 million in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Of the 2007 amount, $93 million related to RJR Tobacco and $23 million related to Conwood. RJR Tobacco plans to spend $95 million to $105 million for capital expenditures during 2008, and Conwood plans to spend $40 million to $50 million. Capital expenditures are funded primarily by cash flows from operations. RAIs operating subsidiaries capital expenditure programs are expected to continue at a level sufficient to support their strategic and operating needs. There were no material long term commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2007. Debt Credit Facility In June 2007, RAI entered into a Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, referred to as the RAI Credit Facility, which provides for a five year, $550 million senior secured revolving credit facility, which may be increased to $900 million at the discretion of the lenders upon the request of RAI. The credit agreement amends and restates RAIs prior agreement dated May 31, 2006. RAI is able to use the RAI Credit Facility for borrowings and issuances of letters of credit, at its option. RAI is required to pay a commitment fee ranging from 0.25% to 1.00% per annum on the unused portion of the facility. Borrowings under the RAI Credit Facility bear interest, at the option of RAI, at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus: the reference rate, which is the higher of the federal funds effective rate plus 0.5% and the prime rate; or the eurodollar rate, which is the rate at which eurodollar deposits for one, two, three or six months are offered in the interbank eurodollar market. At December 31, 2007, RAI had $22 million in letters of credit outstanding under its facility. No borrowings were outstanding, and the remaining $528 million of the RAI Credit Facility was available for borrowing. The RAI Credit Facility contains, among others, the following restrictive covenants that limit, and in some circumstances prohibit, the ability of RAI and its subsidiaries to: incur or guarantee additional debt; pay dividends; make capital expenditures, investments or other restricted payments; engage in transactions with shareholders and affiliates; create, incur or assume liens; engage in mergers, acquisitions and consolidations; sell assets; issue or sell capital stock of subsidiaries; exceed a Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio of 3.25:1.00; and fall below a Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio of 3.00:1.00. 45 Table of Contents These covenants in the RAI Credit Facility are subject to a number of qualifications and exceptions. The maturity date of the RAI Credit Facility is June 28, 2012, which date may be extended in two separate one year increments. RAIs material domestic subsidiaries guarantee RAIs obligations under the facility. These guarantors also generally have pledged substantially all of their assets to secure these obligations. RAI has pledged substantially all of its assets, including the stock of its direct subsidiaries, to secure its obligations under the facility. The collateral for the facility generally will be released automatically in certain circumstances, including at such time, if any, as RAI obtains an investment grade corporate credit rating with not worse than stable outlooks by each of Moodys and SP. See Item 8, note 11 to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the RAI Credit Facility. Long term Debt As of December 31, 2007, RAIs total debt of $4.5 billion consisted of RAI senior secured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $4.4 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2009 to 2037 and RJR unsecured notes in the aggregate principal amount of $132 million, with maturity dates ranging from 2009 to 2015. For more information regarding RAIs and RJRs long term debt, see Item 8, note 12 to consolidated financial statements. In June 2007, RAI completed the sale of $1.55 billion in aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes, consisting of $400 million of floating rate notes due June 15, 2011, $700 million of 6.75% notes due June 15, 2017, and $450 million of 7.25% notes due June 15, 2037. These notes were sold under RAIs shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on June 18, 2007. The net proceeds from the offering, together with available cash, were used to prepay in full the principal balance of $1.54 billion of a term loan, together with accrued and unpaid interest, which indebtedness was incurred in connection with the acquisition of the Conwood companies. In June 2007 and July 2007, $46 million and $29 million, respectively, of RJR notes matured and were paid. The guarantors of the RAI Credit Facility also guarantee RAIs senior secured notes. RAIs senior secured notes are secured by a pledge of the stock, indebtedness and other obligations of RJR Tobacco owned by or owed to RAI or any restricted subsidiary, as defined in the indenture governing the notes. Such notes also are secured by any principal property of RAI and any guarantor that is a restricted subsidiary. Santa Fe and Lane are excluded from the definition of restricted subsidiary. These assets constitute a portion of the security for the obligations of RAI and the guarantors under the RAI Credit Facility. If these assets are no longer pledged as security for the obligations of RAI and the guarantors under the RAI Credit Facility, or any other indebtedness of RAI, they will be released automatically as security for RAIs senior secured notes and the related guarantees. Generally, the terms of RAIs senior secured notes restrict the pledge of collateral, sale/leaseback transactions and the transfer of all or substantially all of the assets of certain of RAIs subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2007, Moodys corporate credit rating of RAI was Ba1, positive outlook, and SPs rating was BB+, positive outlook. Concerns about, or lowering of, RAIs corporate ratings by SP or Moodys could have an adverse impact on RAIs ability to access the debt markets and could increase borrowing costs. However, given the cash balances and operating performance of RAI and its subsidiaries, RAIs management believes that such concerns about, or lowering of, such ratings would not have a material adverse impact on RAIs cash flows. At its option, RAI and RJR, as applicable, may redeem any or all of their outstanding fixed rate notes, in whole or in part at any time, subject to the payment of a make whole premium. The floating rate notes are redeemable at par beginning 18 months after issuance. RAI and RJR use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on a portion of their debt obligations. Under certain conditions, any fair value that results in a liability position of certain interest rate swaps may require full collateralization with cash or securities. RAI, RJR and their affiliates were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions imposed by their indebtedness at December 31, 2007. 46 Table of Contents Litigation and Settlements As discussed in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements, RJR Tobacco, the Conwood companies and their affiliates, including RAI, and indemnitees, including BW, have been named in a number of tobacco related legal actions, proceedings or claims seeking damages in amounts ranging into the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. Unfavorable judgments have been returned in a number of tobacco related cases and state enforcement actions. As of February 8, 2008, RJR Tobacco has paid approximately $41 million since January 1, 2005, related to unfavorable judgments, including pre acquisition contingencies related to the BW business combination. As discussed in more detail in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements, in 2007, RJR Tobacco accrued $6 million related to unfavorable judgments in the individual plaintiffs cases tried in conjunction with the Engle v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. case. This amount is included in selling, general and administrative expenses in the RAI consolidated statement of income for the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition to the $6 million accrual discussed above, which was paid on February 8, 2008, RJR has liabilities totaling $94 million that were recorded in 1999 in connection with certain indemnification claims, not related to smoking and health, asserted by JTI against RJR and RJR Tobacco, relating to the activities of Northern Brands and related litigation. Despite the unfavorable judgments discussed in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements, RAIs management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees, or the loss of any particular claim concerning the use of smokeless tobacco against the Conwood companies, when viewed on an individual basis, is not probable. RAI and its subsidiaries believe that they have valid basis for appeal of adverse verdicts against them and have valid defenses to all actions and intend to defend all actions vigorously. Nonetheless, the possibility of material losses related to tobacco litigation is more than remote. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and generally it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against RJR Tobacco, the Conwood companies or their affiliates or indemnitees, or to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss. Moreover, notwithstanding the quality of defenses available to it and its affiliates in tobacco related litigation matters, it is possible that RAIs consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows could be materially adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of certain pending or future litigation matters. In November 1998, RJR Tobacco, BW and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers entered into the MSA with attorneys general representing most U.S. states, territories and possessions. As described in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements, the MSA imposes a perpetual stream of future payment obligations on RJR Tobacco and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers and places significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell cigarettes in the future. For more information related to historical and expected settlement expenses and payments under the MSA, see Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Health Care Cost Recovery Cases MSA in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. The MSA has materially adversely affected RJR Tobaccos shipment volumes. RAI believes that these settlement obligations may materially adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of RAI and RJR Tobacco in future periods. The degree of the adverse impact will depend, among other things, on the rate of decline in U.S. cigarette sales in the premium and value categories, RJR Tobaccos share of the domestic premium and value cigarette categories, and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to the MSA. RJR Tobacco and certain of the other participating manufacturers under the MSA are currently involved in litigation with the settling states with respect to the availability for certain market years of a downward adjustment to the annual MSA settlement payment obligation, known as the Non Participating Manufacturer Adjustment. Pending the resolution of these disputes, RJR Tobacco and certain of the other participating manufacturers have placed the disputed portions of their 2006 and 2007 annual payments into the MSA disputed funds account. RJR Tobacco currently has approximately $1.2 billion deposited in the MSA disputed funds account. For more information related to this litigation, see Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry MSA Enforcement and Validity in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. 47 Table of Contents Governmental Activity The marketing, sale, taxation and use of tobacco products have been subject to substantial regulation by government and health officials for many years. Various state governments have adopted or are considering, among other things, legislation and regulations that would: significantly increase their taxes on tobacco products; restrict displays, advertising and sampling of tobacco products; establish fire standards compliance for cigarettes; raise the minimum age to possess or purchase tobacco products; restrict or ban the use of certain flavorings or flavor descriptors in tobacco products; require the disclosure of ingredients used in the manufacture of tobacco products; require the disclosure of nicotine yield information for cigarettes based on a machine test method different from that required by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission; impose restrictions on smoking in public and private areas; and restrict the sale of tobacco products directly to consumers or other unlicensed recipients, including over the Internet. In addition, during 2008, the U.S. Congress will likely consider regulation of the manufacture and sale of tobacco products by the FDA, and a further increase in the federal excise tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products. The U.S. Congress also may consider legislation regarding: regulation of environmental tobacco smoke; additional warnings on tobacco packaging and advertising; reduction or elimination of the tax deductibility of advertising expenses; implementation of national fire standards compliance for cigarettes; regulation of the retail sale of tobacco products over the Internet and in other non face to face retail transactions, such as by mail order and telephone; and banning of the delivery of tobacco products by the U.S. Postal Service. In February 2007, proposed legislation was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate that would give the FDA broad regulatory authority over tobacco products. The U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee approved the FDA regulation bill on August 1, 2007. The Health Subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives held a hearing on the bill on October 3, 2007, but no further action is scheduled at this time. The proposals would grant the FDA authority to impose product standards, including standards relating to, among other things, nicotine yields and smoke constituents, and would reinstate the FDAs 1996 proposed legislation that would have restricted marketing. The proposed legislation also would govern modified risk products and would impose new and larger warning labels on tobacco products. At this time, RAI does not know whether FDA regulation over tobacco products will be approved by the balance of Congress or signed into law by the President. Together with manufacturers price increases in recent years and substantial increases in state and federal taxes on tobacco products, these developments have had and will likely continue to have an adverse effect on the sale of tobacco products. Cigarettes are subject to substantial excise taxes in the United States. The federal excise tax per pack of 20 cigarettes is $0.39. In 2007, the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives approved an increase of $0.61 in the excise tax per pack of cigarettes, and proportional increases on other tobacco products to fund expansion of the State Childrens Health Insurance Program, referred to as SCHIP. The President vetoed the bill on October 3, 2007. On October 18, 2007, the U.S. House of Representatives failed to override the Presidents veto of the bill. Subsequently, 48 Table of Contents the U.S. Congress passed a slightly revised version of the SCHIP bill, and the President vetoed the bill on December 12, 2007. In January 2008, by a vote of 152 260, the U.S. House of Representatives failed to override the veto. In between the passage of the revised legislation and the override vote, the U.S. Congress passed an extension of SCHIP through March of 2009 without a tax increase. At this time, RAI does not know whether any excise tax bill will be approved to fund SCHIP or any other federal program. The adoption of any such increase could have a material adverse effect on the business or results of operations of RJR Tobacco. All states and the District of Columbia currently impose excise taxes at levels ranging from $0.07 per pack in South Carolina to $2.575 per pack in New Jersey. As of December 31, 2007, the weighted average state cigarette excise tax per pack, calculated on a 12 month rolling average basis, was approximately $0.92, an increase compared to the 12 month rolling average of $0.799 as of December 31, 2006. During 2007, eight states passed excise tax per pack increases. In addition, several states are expected to consider an increase in their excise tax per pack during 2008. Certain city and county governments, such as New York and Chicago, also impose substantial excise taxes on cigarettes sold in those jurisdictions. Cigars are generally taxed by states on an ad valorem basis, ranging from 5% in South Carolina to 75% in Alaska and Washington. Other states have unit based tax schemes for cigars or tax little cigars the same as cigarettes. The federal excise tax on smokeless tobacco products currently is $0.195 per pound for chewing tobacco, and $0.585 per pound for snuff. The federal tax on small cigars, defined as those weighing three pounds or less per thousand, is $1.828 per thousand. Large cigars are taxed at a rate of 20.719% of the manufacturers price, with a cap of $48.75 per thousand. Forty nine states also subject smokeless tobacco to excise taxes and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which currently levies no tax on other tobacco products, may consider one during its current legislative session. As of December 31, 2007, 38 states taxed moist snuff, and 46 states taxed chewing tobacco, on an ad valorem basis at rates that range from 5% in South Carolina to 90% in Massachusetts. Other states have a unit tax or a weight based tax. During 2007, three states changed their tax on moist snuff from an ad valorem tax to a weight based tax, although two of the changes were not effective until January 1, 2008. In addition, legislation to covert from an ad valorem to a weight based tax also has been introduced in approximately 17 other states. On October 25, 2006, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Department of Treasury, referred to as the TTB, issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, proposing changes to the regulations that govern the classification and labeling of cigars and cigarettes for federal excise tax purposes. The TTB now is considering written comments that were received prior to the March 26, 2007 deadline. Both the CAPTAIN BLACK and WINCHESTER little cigar brands manufactured by Lane, which are classified and sold as little cigars, would be re classified as cigarettes under these proposed regulations. Although it is not possible to fully assess and quantify the negative impact of the proposed regulations, if adopted, on the little cigar products of Lane, the immediate impact would be to increase the federal excise tax on such products by more than tenfold. In addition, if little cigars are classified as cigarettes for federal excise purposes, it is possible that the states would take the position that MSA obligations also apply to these products. In 1964, the Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service concluded that cigarette smoking was a health hazard of sufficient importance to warrant appropriate remedial action. Since 1966, federal law has required a warning statement on cigarette packaging. Since 1971, television and radio advertising of cigarettes has been prohibited in the United States. Cigarette advertising in other media in the United States is required to include information with respect to the tar and nicotine yield of cigarettes, as well as a warning statement. During the past four decades, various laws affecting the cigarette industry have been enacted. In 1964, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act. Among other things, this act: establishes an interagency committee on smoking and health that is charged with carrying out a program to inform the public of any dangers to human health presented by cigarette smoking; 49 Table of Contents requires a series of four health warnings to be printed on cigarette packages and advertising on a rotating basis; increases type size and area of the warning required in cigarette advertisements; and requires that cigarette manufacturers provide annually, on a confidential basis, a list of ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The warnings currently required on cigarette packages and advertisements are: SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease, Emphysema, And May Complicate Pregnancy; SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Quitting Smoking Now Greatly Reduces Serious Risks to Your Health; SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Smoking By Pregnant Women May Result in Fetal Injury, Premature Birth, And Low Birth Weight; and SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon Monoxide. Since the initial report in 1964, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, now the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Surgeon General have issued a number of other reports which purport to find the nicotine in cigarettes addictive and to link cigarette smoking and exposure to cigarette smoke with certain health hazards, including various types of cancer, coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive lung disease. These reports have recommended various governmental measures to reduce the incidence of smoking. In 1992, the federal Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Act was signed into law. This act required states to adopt a minimum age of 18 for purchase of tobacco products and to establish a system to monitor, report and reduce the illegal sale of tobacco products to minors in order to continue receiving federal funding for mental health and drug abuse programs. In 1996, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced regulations implementing this legislation. And in 2006, the Surgeon General released a report entitled The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke. Among its conclusions, the report found the following: exposure of adults to secondhand smoke causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer, exposure of children to secondhand smoke results in an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome, acute respiratory infections, ear problems and more severe asthma; and that there is no risk free level of exposure to secondhand smoke. In 1986, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986, which, among other things, required health warning notices on smokeless tobacco packages and advertising and prohibited the advertising of smokeless tobacco products on any medium of electronic communications subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission. The warnings currently required on smokeless tobacco packages and advertising, which appear on a rotating basis, are: WARNING: THIS PRODUCT MAY CAUSE MOUTH CANCER; WARNING: THIS PRODUCT MAY CAUSE GUM DISEASE AND TOOTH LOSS; and WARNING: THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO CIGARETTES. In 2000, the seven largest U.S. cigar companies, including Lane, entered into agreements with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission to clearly and conspicuously display on virtually every cigar package and advertisement one of the following warnings, which appear on a rotating basis: SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Cigar Smoking Can Cause Cancers Of The Mouth And Throat, Even If You Do Not Inhale; SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Cigar Smoking Can Cause Lung Cancer And Heart Disease; SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Tobacco Use Increases The Risk Of Infertility, Stillbirth And Low Birth Weight; SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Cigars Are Not A Safe Alternative To Cigarettes; and 50 Table of Contents SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Tobacco Smoke Increases The Risk Of Lung Cancer And Heart Disease, Even In Nonsmokers. Legislation imposing various restrictions on public smoking also has been enacted in 49 states and many local jurisdictions, and many employers have initiated programs restricting or eliminating smoking in the workplace. A number of states have enacted legislation designating a portion of increased cigarette excise taxes to fund either anti smoking programs, health care programs or cancer research. In addition, educational and research programs addressing health care issues related to smoking are being funded from industry payments made or to be made under settlements with state attorneys general. Federal law prohibits smoking in scheduled passenger aircraft, and the U.S. Interstate Commerce Commission has banned smoking on buses transporting passengers interstate. Certain common carriers have imposed additional restrictions on passenger smoking. In 2003, the California Environmental Protection Agency Air Resources Board issued a Proposed Identification of Environmental Tobacco Smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant for public review. In 2006, the Air Resources Board identified environmental tobacco smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant, following a three year administrative process. The Air Resources Board is now required to prepare a report assessing the need and appropriate degree of control of environmental tobacco smoke. RJR Tobacco cannot predict the form any future California regulation may take. In 2003, the New York Office of Fire Prevention and Control issued a final standard with accompanying regulations that requires all cigarettes offered for sale in New York State after June 28, 2004, to achieve specified test results when placed on ten layers of filter paper in controlled laboratory conditions. The cigarettes that RAIs operating companies sell in New York State comply with this standard. As of December 31, 2007, 21 states in addition to New York had enacted fire standards compliance legislation of their own, adopting the same testing standard set forth in the OFPC regulations described above. Similar legislation is being considered in a number of other states and Washington, D.C. Consistent with these state legislative trends and its effort to increase productivity and reduce complexity, on October 25, 2007, RJR Tobacco announced its plans to voluntarily convert all its brands to fire standards compliant paper by the end of 2009. Varying standards from state to state could have an adverse effect on the business or results of operations of RJR Tobacco. In 2006, The Massachusetts Department of Public Health released a report entitled, Change in Nicotine Yields 1998 2004, based on data submitted by RJR Tobacco as well as other cigarette manufacturers pursuant to Massachusetts law. Under this law, cigarette manufacturers are required to provide nicotine yield data generated under a machine test method different from that required by the FTC for all styles of a cigarette brand family that has a national market share of 3% or more, as well as other brand styles selected by the MDPH. Other than Texas in 2000, no other state has passed similar regulations. In July 2007, the State of Maine became the first state to enact a statute that prohibits the sale of cigarettes and cigars that have a characterizing flavor. The legislation defines characterizing flavor as a distinguishable taste or aroma that is imparted to tobacco or tobacco smoke either prior to or during consumption, other than a taste or aroma from tobacco, menthol, clove, coffee, nuts or peppers. In 2006, RJR Tobacco entered into an agreement with the States Attorneys General whereby it agreed not to use fruit, candy or alcoholic terms in its advertising or packaging of cigarette products other than in adult only facilities. In contrast to this agreement, the Maine statute does not address the marketing or advertising, but focuses on the content of the product. Similar legislation has been filed in other states. A price differential exists between cigarettes manufactured for sale abroad and cigarettes manufactured for U.S. sale. Consequently, a domestic gray market has developed in cigarettes manufactured for sale abroad, but instead diverted for domestic sales that compete with cigarettes that RJR Tobacco manufactures for domestic sale. The U.S. federal government and all states, except Massachusetts, have enacted legislation prohibiting the sale and distribution of gray market cigarettes. In addition, RJR Tobacco has taken legal action against certain distributors and retailers who engage in such practices. RJR Tobacco expects to benefit from certain state legislative activity aimed at leveling the playing field between original participating manufacturers under the MSA and nonparticipating manufacturers under the MSA, referred to as NPMs. Forty six states have passed legislation to ensure NPMs are making required escrow payments. Under this legislation, a state would only permit distribution of brands by manufacturers who are deemed 51 Table of Contents by the states to be MSA compliant. Failure to make escrow payments could result in the loss of an NPMs ability to sell tobacco products in a respective state. Additionally, 44 states have enacted legislation that closes a loophole in the MSA. The loophole allows NPMs that concentrate their sales in a single state, or a limited number of states, to recover most of the funds from their escrow accounts. To obtain the refunds, the manufacturers must establish that their escrow deposit was greater than the amount the state would have received had the manufacturer been a subsequent participating manufacturer under the MSA, that is, the states allocable share. NAAG has endorsed adoption of the allocable share legislation needed to eliminate this loophole. Following a challenge by NPMs, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York has issued an order enjoining New York from enforcing allocable share legislation. It is possible that NPMs will challenge allocable share legislation passed in other states. Finally, four states, Alaska, Michigan, Minnesota and Utah, have enacted equity assessments on NPMs products. This legislative initiative has not been endorsed by NAAG, and one NPM has filed a challenge to the equity assessment in Michigan. Forty two states by statute or court rule have limited, and several additional states are considering limiting, the amount of the bonds required to file an appeal of an adverse judgment in state court. The limitation on the amount of such bonds generally ranges from $1 million to $150 million. Bonding statutes in 37 states allow defendants that are subject to large adverse judgments, such as cigarette manufacturers, to reasonably bond such judgments and pursue the appellate process. In five other states and Puerto Rico, the filing of a notice of appeal automatically stays the judgment of the trial court. In 2003, the World Health Organization adopted a broad tobacco control treaty. The treaty recommends and requires enactment of legislation establishing specific actions to prevent youth smoking, restrict and gradually eliminate tobacco products marketing, provide greater regulation and disclosure of ingredients, increase the size and scope of package warning labels to cover at least 30% of each package and include graphic pictures on packages. The treaty entered into force on February 27, 2005 90 days after ratification by the 40th country. In February 2006, the first session of the Conference of the Parties, referred to as the COP, occurred in Geneva, Switzerland. The COP, among other actions taken, established a permanent secretariat, adopted a budget, and created working groups to begin to develop protocols on cross border advertising and illegal trade and guidelines on establishing smoke free places and regulating tobacco products. In July 2007, the second session of the COP occurred in Bangkok, Thailand. Among the decisions taken, the COP adopted guidelines from the working group on the protection from exposure to tobacco smoke and called for an intergovernmental negotiating body to negotiate a protocol on illicit trade. The third session of the COP will be held in South Africa in the fourth quarter of 2008. Although the U.S. delegate to the World Health Organization voted for the treaty in May 2003, and the Secretary for Health and Human Services signed the document in May 2004, it is not known whether the treaty will be sent to the U.S. Senate for ratification. Ratification of the treaty by the United States could lead to broader regulation of the industry. It is not possible to determine what additional federal, state or local legislation or regulations relating to smoking or cigarettes will be enacted or to predict the effect of new legislation or regulations on RJR Tobacco or the cigarette industry in general, but any new legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on RJR Tobacco or the cigarette industry in general. Similarly, it is not possible to determine what additional federal, state or local legislation or regulations relating to smokeless tobacco products will be enacted or to predict the effect of new regulation on Conwood or smokeless tobacco products in general, but any new legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on Conwood or smokeless tobacco products in general. Tobacco Buyout Legislation and Related Litigation On October 22, 2004, the President signed the Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act of 2004, referred to as FETRA, eliminating the U.S. governments tobacco production controls and price support program. The buyout of tobacco quota holders provided for in FETRA is funded by a direct quarterly assessment on every tobacco product manufacturer and importer, on a market share basis measured on volume to which federal excise tax is applied. The aggregate cost of the buyout to the industry is approximately $9.9 billion, including approximately $9.6 billion payable to quota tobacco holders and growers through industry assessments over ten years and approximately $290 million for the liquidation of quota tobacco stock. As a result of the tobacco buyout legislation, the MSA 52 Table of Contents Phase II obligations established in 1999 will be continued as scheduled through the end of 2010, but will be offset against the tobacco quota buyout obligations. RAIs operating subsidiaries annual expense under FETRA, excluding the tobacco stock liquidation assessment, is estimated to be approximately $230 million to $280 million. RAIs operating subsidiaries incurred $81 million in 2005 related to assessments from quota tobacco stock liquidation. In 2006, a $9 million favorable adjustment was recorded relating to the tobacco stock liquidation assessment. Remaining contingent liabilities for liquidation of quota tobacco stock, if any, will be recorded when an assessment is made. See Item 8, note 1 to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to federal tobacco buyout expenses. RAIs operating subsidiaries will record the FETRA assessment on a quarterly basis as cost of goods sold. RAIs operating subsidiaries estimate that their overall share of the buyout will approximate $2.4 billion to $2.9 billion prior to the deduction of permitted offsets under the MSA. In addition, future market pricing could impact the carrying value of inventory, and adversely affect RJR Tobaccos financial position and results of operations. As noted above, the MSA Phase II obligations will be offset against the tobacco quota buyout obligations. Because growers in two states, Maryland and Pennsylvania, did not participate in the quota system, they are not eligible for payments under FETRA. Given that the assessments paid by tobacco product manufacturers and importers under FETRA would fully offset their MSA Phase II payment obligations, the growers in Maryland and Pennsylvania would no longer receive payments under the MSA Phase II program. Thus, the growers in these two states would not receive payment under either FETRA or the MSA Phase II program. On December 17, 2004, Maryland and Pennsylvania filed a lawsuit in the North Carolina Business Court, contending that they are entitled to relief from the operation of the tax offset adjustment provision of the Growers Trust and that payments under the Growers Trust to the growers in their states should continue. For more information on this lawsuit, see Tobacco Buyout Legislation and Related Litigation in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Other Contingencies and Guarantees In 2002, R. J. Reynolds Tobacco C. V., an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of RAI and referred to as RJRTCV, and an affiliate of Gallaher Group Plc, referred to as Gallaher, formed a joint venture, with each party owning a 50% membership interest. The joint venture, R. J. Reynolds Gallaher International Sarl, markets American blend cigarettes primarily in Italy, France and Spain. On April 18, 2007, an affiliate of Japan Tobacco Inc. acquired Gallaher, and Gallaher subsequently notified RJRTCV that the acquisition constituted a change of control of Gallaher within the meaning of the joint venture agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the joint venture agreement, RJRTCV elected to terminate the joint venture prior to its expiration date. The joint venture was terminated on December 31, 2007. The joint venture agreement provides that upon a termination of the joint venture, the value of all of the trademarks each member of the joint venture or its affiliate has licensed to the joint venture, other than Natural American Spirit, would be calculated and the party whose licensed trademarks were determined to be of greater value would be required to pay the other party an amount equal to one half of the difference between the values of the parties respective trademarks. On February 20, 2008, following the parties negotiations regarding the trademarks values, RJRTCV and Gallaher Limited, an affiliate of Gallaher Group Plc, entered into a Valuation Payment Settlement Agreement, referred to as the Settlement Agreement, pursuant to which Gallaher Limited agreed to pay RJRTCV a Termination Amount equal to euros 265,000,000 (approximately $387,562,500).

Gallaher Limiteds obligations under the Settlement Agreement have been guaranteed by JT International Holding B.V., an affiliate of Gallaher Limited, pursuant to a Guarantee dated February 20, 2008.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. RAI and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to their normal investing and funding activities. In addition, RAI and its subsidiaries have immaterial exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk concerning obligations for, and service agreements related to, foreign operations denominated in euros, British pounds, Swiss francs, Chinese renminbi and Japanese yen. RAI and its subsidiaries have established policies and procedures to manage their exposure to market risks and use major creditworthy institutions as counterparties to minimize their investment and credit risk. Frequently, these institutions are also members of the bank group that provide RAI credit, and management believes this further minimizes the risk of nonperformance. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes. The table below provides information about RAIs financial instruments, as of December 31, 2007, that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
