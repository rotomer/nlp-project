Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following is a discussion and analysis of RAIs business, initiatives, critical accounting policies and its consolidated results of operations and financial position. Following the overview and discussion of business initiatives, the critical accounting policies disclose certain accounting policies that are material to RAIs results of operations and financial position for the periods presented in this report. The discussion and analysis of RAIs results of operations is presented in two comparative sections, 2008 compared with 2007, and 2007 compared with 2006. Disclosures related to liquidity and financial position complete managements discussion and analysis. You should read this discussion and analysis of RAIs consolidated financial position and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, and for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2008. Overview and Business Initiatives RAIs reportable operating segments are RJR Tobacco and Conwood. The RJR Tobacco segment consists of the primary operations of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. The Conwood segment consists of Conwood Holdings, Inc., the primary operations of the Conwood companies and Lane. RAIs wholly owned subsidiaries, Santa Fe and GPI, among others, are included in All Other. Some of RAIs wholly owned operating subsidiaries have entered into intercompany agreements for products or services with other RAI operating subsidiaries. As a result, certain activities of an operating subsidiary may be included in a different segment of RAI. RAIs largest reportable operating segment, RJR Tobacco, is the second largest cigarette manufacturer in the United States. RJR Tobaccos largest selling cigarette brands, CAMEL, KOOL, PALL MALL, DORAL and WINSTON, were five of the ten best selling brands of cigarettes in the United States as of December 31, 2008. Those brands, and its other brands, including SALEM, MISTY and CAPRI, are manufactured in a variety of styles and marketed in the United States. RJR Tobacco also manages contract manufacturing of cigarettes and tobacco products through arrangements with BAT affiliates. As of January 1, 2008, the contract manufacturing business of GPI was transferred to RJR Tobacco. RAIs other reportable operating segment, Conwood, is the second largest smokeless tobacco products manufacturer in the United States. Conwoods primary brands include its largest selling moist snuff brands, GRIZZLY and KODIAK, two of the seven best selling brands of moist snuff in the United States as of December 31, 2008. Conwoods other products include loose leaf chewing tobacco, dry snuff, plug and twist tobacco products. Conwoods products held the first or second position in market share in each category as of December 31, 2008. As a result of combining certain operations of Lane with the Conwood companies in 2007, Conwood began distributing a variety of other tobacco products, including WINCHESTER and CAPTAIN BLACK little cigars, and BUGLER roll your own tobacco. Santa Fe manufactures and markets cigarettes and other tobacco products under the NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand. On January 1, 2008, the management of RJR Tobaccos super premium brands, including those licensed from BAT, including DUNHILL and STATE EXPRESS 555, was transferred to Santa Fe. During 2008, GPI sold NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT in Europe and Japan, as well as exported tobacco products to U.S. territories, U.S. duty free shops and U.S. overseas military bases. In January 2009, the activities of GPI were transitioned to other operating subsidiaries of RAI. The management and export of tobacco products sold to certain U.S. territories, U.S. duty free shops and U.S. overseas military bases was transferred to RJR Tobacco and other indirect subsidiaries of RAI began selling NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT in Europe and Japan. 26 Table of Contents RJR Tobacco RJR Tobacco primarily conducts business in the highly competitive U.S. cigarette market, which has a few large manufacturers and many smaller participants. The U.S. cigarette market is a mature market in which overall consumer demand has declined since 1981 and is expected to continue to decline. Trade inventory adjustments may result in short term changes in demand for RJR Tobaccos products when wholesale and retail tobacco distributors adjust the timing of their purchases of product to manage their inventory levels. RJR Tobacco believes it is not appropriate for it to speculate on other external factors that may impact the purchasing decisions of the wholesale and retail tobacco distributors. RJR Tobaccos brand portfolio strategy is based upon three brand categories: growth, support and non support. During 2008, RJR Tobacco refined its brand portfolio strategy and reclassified KOOL from a growth brand to a support brand. As a result, the growth brands consist of a premium brand, CAMEL, and a value brand, PALL MALL. Although both of these brands are managed for long term market share and profit growth, CAMEL will continue to receive the most significant investment support. The support brands include four premium brands, KOOL, WINSTON, SALEM and CAPRI, and two value brands, DORAL and MISTY, all of which receive limited marketing support. The non support brands, consisting of all other brands, are managed to maximize near term profitability. The key objectives of the portfolio strategy are to ensure the long term market share growth of the growth brands while managing the support brands for long term sustainability and profitability. Competition is based primarily on brand positioning, including price, product attributes and packaging, consumer loyalty, promotions, advertising and retail presence. Cigarette brands produced by the major manufacturers generally require competitive pricing, substantial marketing support, retail programs and other incentives to maintain or improve market position or to introduce a new brand style. Expanding beyond the cigarette market as an innovative tobacco company, in 2006, RJR Tobacco entered into a category of smokeless, spitless tobacco, known as snus. CAMEL Snus is pasteurized tobacco that is sold in a small pouch that provides convenient tobacco consumption. CAMEL Snus was launched in lead markets beginning in 2006, and is being expanded nationally during the first quarter of 2009. In addition, during 2008, RJR Tobacco announced new smoke free tobacco products called CAMEL Dissolvables. CAMEL Dissolvables include CAMEL Orbs, Sticks and Strips, all of which are made of finely milled tobacco and dissolve completely in the mouth. CAMEL Dissolvables will be launched in lead markets beginning in the first half of 2009. RJR Tobacco is committed to building and maintaining a portfolio of profitable brands. RJR Tobaccos marketing programs are designed to strengthen brand image, build brand awareness and loyalty, and switch adult smokers of competing brands to RJR Tobacco brands. In addition to building strong brand equity, RJR Tobaccos marketing approach utilizes a retail pricing strategy, including discounting at retail, to defend certain brands shares of market against competitive pricing pressure. RJR Tobaccos competitive pricing methods may include list price changes, discounting programs, such as retail buydowns, periodic price reductions, free product promotions and consumer coupons. Retail buydowns refer to payments made to the retailer to reduce the price that consumers pay at retail. Consumer coupons generally are distributed by a variety of methods, including in, or on, the cigarette pack and by direct mail. Free product promotions include offers such as Buy 2 packs, Get 1 pack free. The cost of free product promotions, including federal excise tax, is recorded in cost of goods sold. Conwood Conwood offers a range of differentiated smokeless and other tobacco products to adult consumers. The moist snuff category is divided into premium and price value brands. The moist snuff category has developed many of the characteristics of the larger, cigarette market, including multiple pricing tiers with intense competition, focused marketing programs and significant product innovation. In contrast to the declining U.S. cigarette market, U.S. moist snuff volumes grew over 7% in 2008 and have grown at an average rate of approximately 6% per year over the last four years, driven by the accelerated growth of price value brands. Profit margins on moist snuff products are generally higher than on cigarette products. Moist snuffs growth is partially attributable to cigarette smokers switching from cigarettes to smokeless tobacco products or using both. Within the moist snuff category, premium brands have lost market share to price value brands, led by the growth of GRIZZLY, in recent years. 27 Table of Contents Conwood faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco categories. Similar to the cigarette market, competition is based primarily on brand positioning and price, as well as product attributes and packaging, consumer loyalty, promotions, advertising and retail presence. The parent company of RJR Tobaccos largest competitor in the cigarette market, Philip Morris USA, Inc., completed its acquisition of Conwoods largest competitor, UST, in January 2009. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, referred to as GAAP, require estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the reported amounts in RAIs consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Some of these estimates require difficult, subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and as a result, actual results could differ from those estimates. Due to the estimation processes involved, the following summarized accounting policies and their application are considered to be critical to understanding the business operations, financial position and results of operations of RAI and its subsidiaries. For information related to these and other significant accounting policies, see Item 8, note 1 to consolidated financial statements. Litigation RAI discloses information concerning litigation for which an unfavorable outcome is more than remote. RAI and its subsidiaries record their legal expenses and other litigation costs and related administrative costs as selling, general and administrative expenses as those costs are incurred. RAI and its subsidiaries will record any loss related to litigation at such time as an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate is a range, the recorded loss will be the best estimate within the range. If no amount in the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount of the range will be recorded. As discussed in Item 8, note 16 to consolidated financial statements, RJR Tobacco, the Conwood companies and their affiliates, including RAI, and indemnitees, have been named in a number of tobacco related legal actions, proceedings or claims seeking damages in amounts ranging into the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. Unfavorable judgments have been returned in a number of tobacco related cases and state enforcement actions. As of February 6, 2009, RJR Tobacco had paid approximately $12 million since January 1, 2006, related to unfavorable judgments. RAI and its subsidiaries believe that they have valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against them and have valid defenses to all actions and they intend to defend all actions vigorously. RAIs management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees, including BW, or the loss of any particular claim concerning the use of smokeless tobacco against the Conwood companies, when viewed on an individual basis, is not probable or estimable. RJR, including its subsidiary RJR Tobacco, have liabilities totaling $94 million that were recorded in connection with certain indemnification claims, not related to smoking and health, asserted by JTI against RJR and RJR Tobacco, relating to the activities of Northern Brands and related litigation. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and it is possible that some of the tobacco related legal actions, proceedings or claims could ultimately be decided against RJR Tobacco, the Conwood companies or their affiliates, including RAI, and indemnitees. Any unfavorable outcome of such actions could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of RAI or its subsidiaries. For further discussion of the litigation and legal proceedings pending against RAI or its affiliates or indemnitees, see Item 8, note 16 to consolidated financial statements. Settlement Agreements RJR Tobacco, Santa Fe and Lane are participants in the Master Settlement Agreement, and RJR Tobacco is a participant in other state settlement agreements related to governmental health care cost recovery actions. Their obligations and the related expense charges under the MSA are subject to adjustments based upon, among other things, the volume of cigarettes sold by the operating subsidiaries, their relative market share and inflation. Since relative market share is based on cigarette shipments, the best estimate of the allocation of charges to RJR Tobacco under these 28 Table of Contents agreements is recorded in cost of products sold as the products are shipped. Adjustments to these estimates are recorded in the period that the change becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The Conwood companies are not participants in the MSA. For more information related to historical and expected settlement expenses and payments under the MSA, see Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Health Care Cost Recovery Cases MSA and MSA Enforcement and Validity in Item 8, note 16 to consolidated financial statements. Intangible Assets Intangible assets include goodwill, trademarks and other intangibles and are accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, referred to as SFAS, No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The determination of fair value involves considerable estimates and judgment. In particular, the fair value of a reporting unit involves, among other things, developing forecasts of future cash flows, determining an appropriate discount rate, and when goodwill impairment is implied, determining the fair values of individual assets and liabilities, including unrecorded intangibles. Although RAI believes it has based its impairment testing and impairment charges on reasonable estimates and assumptions, the use of different estimates and assumptions could result in materially different results. Generally, if the current competitive or regulatory environment worsens or RAIs operating companies strategic initiatives adversely affect their financial performance, the fair value of goodwill, trademarks and other intangibles could be impaired in future periods. See Item 8, note 3 to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment charges in connection with RAIs ongoing application of SFAS No. 142. Fair Value Measurement On January 1, 2008, RAI adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, for financial assets and financial liabilities. SFAS No. 157 provides a definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity, and the reporting entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. On October 10, 2008, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, referred to as FASB, issued FASB Staff Position, referred to as FSP, No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active. FSP No. FAS 157 3 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, essentially an exit price. The levels of the fair value hierarchy established by SFAS No. 157 are: Level 1: inputs are quoted prices, unadjusted, in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2: inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. A Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3: inputs are unobservable and reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. Investments As of December 31, 2008, RAI held investments primarily in money market funds, auction rate securities and mortgage backed securities. During 2008, certain money market funds were reclassified to short term investments from cash equivalents due to the liquidity restrictions by the fund managers preventing immediate withdrawal. Adverse changes in financial markets caused certain auction rate securities and mortgage backed securities to 29 Table of Contents revalue lower than carrying value and become less liquid. Auction rate securities and mortgage backed securities will not become liquid until a successful auction occurs or a buyer is found. These investments will be evaluated on a quarterly basis to determine if it is probable that RAI will realize some portion of the unrealized loss. RAI reviews impairments associated with the above in accordance with SFAS No. 115, Accounting for Certain Investments in Debt and Equity Securities, FSP No. FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments, and FSP No. EITF 99 20 1, Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99 20, to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary. For additional information relating to these investments, see Item 8, note 9 to consolidated financial statements. Pension and Postretirement Benefits RAI and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor a number of non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering most of their employees, and also provide certain health and life insurance benefits for most of their retired employees and their dependents. These benefits are generally no longer provided to employees hired on or after January 1, 2004. For additional information relating to pension and postretirement benefits, see Item 8, note 19 to consolidated financial statements. Pension and postretirement expenses and reporting are determined in accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, SFAS No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions and SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106, and 132(R). Because pension and other postretirement obligations ultimately will be settled in future periods, the determination of annual expense and liabilities is subject to estimates and assumptions. RAI reviews these assumptions annually based on historic experience and expected future trends or coincidental with a major event and modifies them as needed. Demographic assumptions such as termination of employment, mortality or retirement are reviewed periodically as expectations change. Gains or losses are annual changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions. The minimum amortization of unrecognized gains or losses, as described in SFAS No. 87, is included in pension expense. Prior service costs, which are changes in benefit obligations due to plan amendments, are amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period for active employees, or average remaining life expectancies for inactive employees if most of the plan obligations are due to inactive employees. The minimum amortization of unrecognized gains or losses, as described in SFAS No. 106, is also included in the postretirement benefit expense. Prior service costs, which are changes in benefit obligations due to plan amendments, are amortized on a straight line basis over the service to expected full eligibility age for active employees, or average remaining life expectancies for inactive employees if most of the plan obligations are due to inactive employees. Differences between actual results and actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods. In recent years, actual results have varied significantly from actuarial assumptions. In particular, pension and postretirement assets have decreased due to significant decreases in fair value. These changes have resulted in an increase in charges to other comprehensive income (loss). These changes are expected to result in an increase in pension and postretirement expense in future years. The Pension Protection Act may require additional cash funding of the pension obligations in the future. 30 Table of Contents The most critical assumptions and their sensitivity to change are presented below: Assumed asset return and discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the benefit plans. A one percentage point change in assumed discount rate for the pension plans and other postretirement plans would have had the following effects: 1 Percentage Point Increase 1 Percentage Point Decrease Pension Postretirement Pension Postretirement Plans Plans Plans Plans Effect on 2008 net periodic benefit cost $ (26 ) $ (6 ) $ 16 $ 5 Effect on December 31, 2008, projected benefit obligation and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (485 ) (127 ) 538 139 A one percentage point change in assumed asset return would have had the following effects: 1 Percentage Point Increase 1 Percentage Point Decrease Pension Postretirement Pension Postretirement Plans Plans Plans Plans Effect on 2008 net periodic benefit cost $ (51 ) $ (3 ) $ 51 $ 3 Income Taxes Tax law requires certain items to be excluded or included in taxable income at different times than is required for book reporting purposes under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. These differences may be permanent or temporary in nature. FASB Interpretation, referred to as FIN, No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, clarifies SFAS No. 109 by providing guidance for consistent reporting of uncertain income tax positions recognized in a companys financial statements. RAI determines its annual effective income tax rate based on forecasted pre tax book income and forecasted permanent book and tax differences. The rate is established at the beginning of the year and is evaluated on a quarterly basis. Any changes to the forecasted information may cause the effective rate to be adjusted. Additional tax, interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in tax expense on a quarterly basis. To the extent that any book and tax differences are temporary in nature, that is, the book realization will occur in a different period than the tax realization, a deferred tax asset or liability is established as required under SFAS No. 109. To the extent that a deferred tax asset is created, management evaluates RAIs ability to realize this asset. Management currently believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets recorded in RAIs consolidated balance sheets will be realized. To the extent a deferred tax liability is established under SFAS No. 109, it is recorded, tracked and, once it becomes currently due and payable, paid to the taxing authorities. The financial statements reflect managements best estimate of RAIs current and deferred tax liabilities and assets. Future events, including but not limited to, additional resolutions with taxing authorities could have an impact on RAIs current estimate of tax liabilities, realization of tax assets and upon RAIs effective income tax rate. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements Effective January 1, 2008, RAI adopted SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, for financial assets and financial liabilities. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but provides a definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosure about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 also establishes a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between independent and observable inputs and unobservable inputs based on the best information available. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 on financial assets and financial liabilities did not have a material impact on RAIs consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, to allow entities to electively defer the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and liabilities, except for those items recognized or disclosed at fair value on an annual or more frequently recurring basis, until fiscal years 31 Table of Contents beginning after November 15, 2008. RAI elected to defer SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities to be effective as of January 1, 2009. For RAI, the deferral primarily applies to (1) nonfinancial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in business combinations; (2) reporting units or nonfinancial assets and liabilities measured at fair value in conjunction with goodwill, trademark and other intangible impairment testing; (3) other nonfinancial assets measured at fair value in conjunction with impairment assessments; and (4) asset retirement obligations initially measured at fair value. RAI believes that the fair value measurements made in these circumstances would not necessarily be different from those that would be made had the provision of SFAS No. 157 been applied, and therefore the impact of the adoption of SFAS No. 157 for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities is not expected to have a material impact on RAIs consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. On October 10, 2008, the FASB, issued FSP No. FAS 157 3, Determining the Fair Value of a Financial Asset When the Market for That Asset Is Not Active. FSP No. FAS 157 3 clarifies the application of SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active. FSP No. FAS 157 3 is effective immediately, including prior periods for which financial statements had not been issued. RAI adopted FSP No. FAS 157 3 effective with the financial statements ended September 30, 2008. The adoption of FSP No. FAS 157 3 had no impact on RAIs consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. On January 13, 2009, the FASB issued FSP No. EITF 99 20 1, Amendments to the Impairment Guidance of EITF Issue No. 99 20. FSP No. EITF 99 20 1 provides a more consistent determination of whether an other than temporary impairment, referred to as OTTI, has occurred and retains and emphasizes the OTTI guidance and required disclosures in SFAS No. 115, and FSP No. FAS 115 1 and FAS 124 1. RAI adopted FSP No. EITF 99 20 1 effective for periods ending after December 15, 2008. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133. SFAS No. 161 seeks qualitative disclosures about the objectives and strategies for using derivatives, quantitative data about the fair value of and gains and losses on derivative contracts, and details of credit risk related contingent features in hedged positions. SFAS No. 161 also seeks enhanced disclosure around derivative instruments in financial statements, accounted for under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and how hedges affect an entitys financial position, financial performance and cash flows. SFAS No. 161 is effective for RAI as of January 1, 2009, and is not expected to impact results of operations, cash flows or financial position. In April 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 142 3, Determination of the Useful Life of Intangible Assets. FSP No. FAS 142 3 amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The objective of FSP No. FAS 142 3 is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under SFAS No. 142 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under SFAS No. 141(R) and GAAP. FSP No. FAS 142 3 is effective for financial statements issued for years beginning after December 15, 2008, and interim periods within those years and is applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date. The adoption of FSP No. FAS 142 3 will require additional disclosure regarding renewal or extension assumptions and will not have a material impact on RAIs results of operations, cash flows or financial position. On December 30, 2008, the FASB issued FSP No. FAS 132(R) 1, Employers Disclosures about Postretirement Benefit Plan Assets. FSP No. FAS 132(R) 1 amends SFAS No. 132(R), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, to provide guidance on an employers disclosures about plan assets of a defined benefit pension or other postretirement plan. The disclosures about plan assets required by FSP No. FAS 132(R) 1 are to be provided for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2009. The adoption of FSP No. FAS 132(R) 1 in 2009 will not have an impact on RAIs results of operations, cash flows or financial position. 32 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2008 Compared with 2007 For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change Net sales:(1) RJR Tobacco $ 7,678 $ 7,945 (3.4 )% Conwood 723 670 7.9 % All other 444 408 8.8 % Net sales 8,845 9,023 (2.0 )% Cost of products sold(1)(2) 4,863 4,960 (2.0 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,500 1,687 (11.1 )% Amortization expense 22 23 (4.3 )% Restructuring charge 90 NM (3) Trademark impairment charges 318 65 NM (3) Operating income: RJR Tobacco 1,756 1,940 (9.5 )% Conwood 232 312 (25.6 )% All other 153 142 7.7 % Corporate expense (89 ) (106 ) (16.0 )% $ 2,052 $ 2,288 (10.3 )% (1) Excludes excise taxes of: 2008 2007 RJR Tobacco $ 1,689 $ 1,847 Conwood 20 18 All other 181 161 $ 1,890 $ 2,026 (2) See below for further information related to MSA settlement and federal tobacco buyout expense included in cost of products sold. (3) Percentage change not meaningful. In the third quarter of 2008, RAI and RJR Tobacco announced changes in their organizational structures to streamline non core business processes and programs in order to allocate additional resources to strategic growth initiatives. The reorganizations will result in the elimination of approximately 600 full time jobs, expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2009. Under existing benefit plans, $83 million of severance related cash benefits and $7 million of non cash pension related benefits comprised a restructuring charge of $90 million. Of this charge, $81 million was recorded in the RJR Tobacco segment. Of the cash portion of the charge, $5 million was paid as of December 31, 2008. The cash benefits are expected to be substantially paid by December 31, 2010. Cost savings related to the restructuring are expected to be $42 million in 2009, $53 million in 2010 and $55 million on an annualized basis thereafter. 33 Table of Contents RJR Tobacco Net Sales Domestic shipment volume, in billions of units for RJR Tobacco and the industry, were as follows(1): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change Growth brands: CAMEL excluding non filter 23.3 24.2 (3.8 )% PALL MALL 8.6 7.1 20.8 % 31.8 31.3 1.7 % Support brands(2) 46.6 52.0 (10.3 )% Non support brands 11.0 14.3 (23.3 )% Total domestic 89.5 97.6 (8.4 )% Total premium 55.9 60.9 (8.2 )% Total value 33.5 36.7 (8.7 )% Premium/Total mix 62.5 % 62.4 % Industry(3): Premium 251.1 259.9 (3.4 )% Value 94.2 97.3 (3.1 )% Total domestic 345.3 357.2 (3.3 )% Premium/Total mix 72.7 % 72.8 % (1) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. Percentages are calculated on unrounded numbers. (2) During 2008, the KOOL brand was reclassified from a growth brand to a support brand. (3) Based on information from MSAi. Prior year amounts have been restated to reflect current methodology. RJR Tobaccos net sales are dependent upon its shipment volume in a declining market, premium versus value brand mix and list pricing, offset by promotional spending, trade incentives and federal excise taxes. During 2008, RJR Tobacco selectively reduced the number of products sold by discontinuing a number of low margin and non core brands and styles to reduce complexity and improve efficiency. RJR Tobaccos net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008, decreased $267 million, or 3.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2007, driven by $339 million attributable to lower volume, partially offset by improved pricing, net of promotional spending. RJR Tobaccos decreases in net sales and shipment volume reflect intensified competitive activity in the first half of 2008, a decrease in consumption, wholesale inventory reductions, and the impact of RJR Tobaccos selective brand and style reduction. In addition, RJR Tobaccos consumers are believed to be more price sensitive than consumers of competing brands and, therefore, are more negatively affected by the current adverse economic pressures. RJR Tobaccos total domestic shipment volume decreased 8.4% in 2008 compared with 2007. Industry shipment volume for 2008 was down 3.3% compared with 2007. 34 Table of Contents The shares of RJR Tobaccos brands as a percentage of total share of U.S. retail cigarette sales according to data(1) from IRI, were as follows(2)(3): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Share Point 2008 2007 Change Growth brands: CAMEL excluding non filter 8.0 % 7.8 % 0.3 PALL MALL 2.6 % 2.1 % 0.5 Total growth brands 10.7 % 9.9 % 0.8 Support brands 13.8 % 14.7 % (0.9 ) Non support brands 3.6 % 4.4 % (0.8 ) Total domestic 28.1 % 29.0 % (1.0 ) (1) Retail share of U.S. cigarette sales data is included in this document because it is used by RJR Tobacco primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants, and brands and market trends. You should not rely on the market share data reported by IRI as being a precise measurement of actual market share because IRI is not able to effectively track all volume. Moreover, you should be aware that in a product market experiencing overall declining consumption, a particular product can experience increasing market share relative to competing products, yet still be subject to declining consumption volumes. (2) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. (3) In 2009, at the request of RJR Tobacco, IRI will revise its sampling model to better reflect the current retail environment. The retail share of market of CAMELs filtered styles increased 0.3 share points in 2008 compared with 2007. During the first half of 2008, CAMEL launched updated packaging and smoother blends for its core styles. CAMEL also introduced CAMEL Crush in lead markets during the first quarter of 2008. CAMEL Crush is an innovative cigarette that uses RJR Tobaccos technology to provide adult smokers the option of changing each cigarette from regular to menthol by crushing a capsule in the filter. CAMEL Crush was expanded nationally during the third quarter of 2008 and had a market share of 0.74 share points in the fourth quarter of 2008. As a result of repositioning KOOL to a support brand, RJR Tobacco is shifting focus to CAMELs menthol styles as the key driver in the growing menthol category. CAMEL Snus expanded into a total of 17 markets in 2008 and is planning to expand nationally in the first quarter of 2009. Additionally, in October 2008, RJR Tobacco introduced new smoke free tobacco products called CAMEL Dissolvables that include CAMEL Orbs, Sticks and Strips. CAMEL Dissolvables are made of finely milled tobacco, and dissolve completely in the mouth. They are designed to provide current adult smokers and smokeless tobacco users with additional, convenient, alternative ways to enjoy tobacco products. CAMEL Dissolvables are being launched in three lead markets beginning in the first half of 2009. PALL MALLs market share increased 0.5 share points in 2008 compared with 2007. PALL MALLs growth is believed to be the result of the brands position as a product that offers a longer lasting cigarette at a value price. PALL MALL introduced more stylish, round corner packs in the second quarter of 2008. The combined share of market of RJR Tobaccos growth brands during 2008 showed improvement over 2007. However, the decline in share of support and non support brands more than offset the gains on the growth brands. Operating Income RJR Tobaccos operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008, decreased $184 million to $1,756 million, or 22.9% of net sales, from $1,940 million, or 24.4% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2007. The reclassification of KOOL to a support brand from a growth brand in the third quarter of 2008 triggered a non cash trademark impairment of $173 million. An additional impairment charge of $3 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 as the result of annual impairment testing of all brand trademarks. The impairment charges 35 Table of Contents were based on the excess of each brands carrying value over its fair value using the present value of estimated future cash flows assuming a discount rate of 10.5%. The discount rate was determined by adjusting the enterprise discount rate by an appropriate risk premium to reflect an asset group risk. In addition, RJR Tobacco incurred a restructuring charge of $81 million in the second half of 2008 as a result of streamlining non core business processes and programs and eliminating approximately 540 full time positions. The trademark impairment charge and restructuring charge were partially offset by higher pricing and improvements in productivity. RJR Tobaccos operating income was also negatively impacted by decreases in shipment volume due to intensified competitive activity in the first half of 2008, a decrease in consumption, wholesale inventory reductions, as well as RJR Tobaccos selective style and brand reduction. RJR Tobaccos MSA settlement and federal tobacco buyout expenses, included in cost of products sold, are detailed in the schedule below: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Settlements $ 2,664 $ 2,791 Federal tobacco quota buyout $ 240 $ 247 MSA settlement expenses are expected to be approximately $2.6 billion in 2009, subject to adjustment for changes in volume and other factors, and expense for the federal tobacco quota buyout is expected to be approximately $230 million to $240 million in 2009. For additional information, see Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Health Care Cost Recovery Cases MSA in Item 8, note 16 to consolidated financial statements and Governmental Activity below. Selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs of litigating and administering product liability claims, as well as other legal expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, RJR Tobaccos product liability defense costs were $96 million and $88 million, respectively. Product liability cases generally include the following types of smoking and health related cases: Individual Smoking and Health; Engle Progeny; Broin II; Class Actions; and Health Care Cost Recovery Claims. Product liability defense costs include the following items: direct and indirect compensation, fees and related costs and expenses for internal legal and related administrative staff administering product liability claims; fees and cost reimbursements paid to outside attorneys; direct and indirect payments to third party vendors for litigation support activities; expert witness costs and fees; and payments to fund legal defense costs for the now dissolved Council for Tobacco Research U.S.A. Numerous factors affect product liability defense costs. The most important factors are the number of cases pending and the number of cases in trial or in preparation for trial, that is, with active discovery and motions practice. See Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Overview in Item 8, note 16 to consolidated financial statements for detailed information regarding the number and type of cases pending, and Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Scheduled Trials in Item 8, note 16 to consolidated financial statements for 36 Table of Contents detailed information regarding the number and nature of cases in trial and scheduled for trial through December 31, 2009. RJR Tobacco expects that the factors described above will continue to have the primary impact on its product liability defense costs in the future. Given RJR Tobaccos experience in defending its product liability cases and the reasonably anticipated level of activity in RJR Tobaccos pending cases and possible new cases, RJR Tobacco anticipates that its product liability defense costs will increase in 2009, compared with the most recent years. See Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Engle Progeny Cases and Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Class Action Suits Engle Case in Item 8, note 16 to consolidated financial statements for additional information. However, it is possible that adverse developments in the factors discussed above, as well as other circumstances beyond the control of RJR Tobacco, could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of RAI or its subsidiaries. Those other circumstances beyond the control of RJR Tobacco include the results of present and future trials and appeals, and the development of possible new theories of liability by plaintiffs and their counsel. Conwood Net Sales The moist snuff shipment volume, in millions of cans, for Conwood was as follows(1): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change Premium: KODIAK 51.0 53.2 (4.2 )% Other 2.8 3.2 (12.5 )% 53.8 56.4 (4.5 )% Price value: GRIZZLY 279.6 237.0 18.0 % Other 1.7 2.2 (22.7 )% 281.3 239.2 17.6 % Total moist snuff 335.2 295.6 13.4 % (1) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. Percentages are calculated on unrounded numbers. Moist snuff has been the key driver to Conwoods overall growth and profitability within the U.S. smokeless tobacco market. Moist snuff accounted for approximately 66% of Conwoods revenue in 2008 and approximately 60% in 2007. Conwoods key brands include KODIAK in the premium brand category and GRIZZLY in the price value brand category. Conwoods U.S. moist snuff market share was 27.7% in 2008 and 26.0% in 2007 based on distributor reported data processed by MSAi, for distributor shipments to retail. Although moist snuff volume grew over 7% in 2008, Conwoods moist snuff volume grew over 13% in 2008, attributable to its innovation, product development and brand building. 37 Table of Contents The Conwood shares of the moist snuff category as a percentage of total share of U.S. shipments of moist snuff, according to distributor reported data(1) processed by MSAi, were as follows(2): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Share 2008 2007 Point Change Premium: KODIAK 4.0 % 4.4 % (0.4 ) Other 0.3 % 0.3 % 4.3 % 4.7 % (0.4 ) Price value: GRIZZLY 23.3 % 21.1 % 2.2 Other 0.1 % 0.2 % (0.1 ) 23.4 % 21.3 % 2.1 Total moist snuff 27.7 % 26.0 % 1.7 (1) Distributor shipments to retail share of U.S. moist snuff is included in this document because it is used by Conwood primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants, and brands and market trends. You should not rely on the market share data reported by distributors and processed by MSAi as being a precise measurement of actual market share because this distributor data set is not able to effectively track all volume. (2) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. Conwoods net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008, were $723 million compared with $670 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Moist snuff sales generated the increase over the prior year period, led by GRIZZLY, Conwoods leading price value moist snuff brand. GRIZZLY had a 23.3% share of moist snuff shipments in 2008, an increase of 2.2 share points from 2007, despite further narrowing of the price gap between premium brands and value brands, such as GRIZZLY. In 2008, Conwood expanded nationally the launch of two new GRIZZLY styles, GRIZZLY Wintergreen Pouches and GRIZZLY Snuff, to build on the brands momentum and aid in its share growth. Building on its pouch success, GRIZZLY is launching mint and straight styles in the first quarter of 2009. The shipment share of KODIAK, Conwoods leading premium moist snuff brand, declined 0.4 share points in 2008 compared with 2007 due to competitive promotional activity and the brands core markets being burdened by high tobacco taxes and the current economic recession. Operating Income Conwoods operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008, decreased to $232 million, or 32.1% of net sales, from $312 million, or 46.5% of net sales for 2007. This change is due to increased price value volume and higher pricing offset primarily by trademark impairment. The annual impairment testing of trademarks in the fourth quarter of 2008 resulted in a charge of $142 million compared with $32 million in 2007. The 2008 impairment occurred on several of Conwoods brands, including KODIAK, which reflected the demand shift from premium to price value brands, as well as multiple loose leaf and little cigar brands. The impairment charges were based on the excess of each brands carrying value over its fair value using the present value of estimated future cash flows assuming a discount rate of 10.5%. The discount rate was determined by adjusting the enterprise discount rate by an appropriate risk premium to reflect an asset group risk. All Other All Other sales for the year ended December 31, 2008, were favorably impacted by the growth of Santa Fes NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand. Operating income for the 2008 year increased as a result of lower marketing expenses in 2008 as compared with 2007. 38 Table of Contents RAI Consolidated Gain on termination of joint venture of $328 million in 2008 resulted from the termination of the Reynolds Gallaher International Sarl joint venture. See Item 8, note 5 to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the joint venture termination. Interest and debt expense was $275 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $63 million over the comparable prior year. This decrease was primarily due to lower effective interest rates and lower outstanding debt in 2008 as compared with 2007. Interest income was $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $74 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. This decrease was the result of investing available cash at lower interest rates in 2008. Other expense (income) net was expense of $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $26 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Impairments on investments deemed other than temporary of $35 million were expensed in 2008. Provision for income taxes was $790 million, or an effective rate of 37.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $766 million, or an effective rate of 37.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2007. The 2008 provision was favorably impacted by a lower tax rate related to the gain on the termination of the Reynolds Gallaher International Sarl joint venture, but was offset by unfavorability related to tax reserves and U.S. taxes recorded on foreign earnings. The effective tax rates exceeded the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of state taxes and certain non deductible items, offset by the domestic production activities deduction of the American Jobs Creation Act, enacted on October 22, 2004. RAI expects its effective tax rate to be approximately 38% in 2009. 2007 Compared with 2006 For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Change Net sales:(1) RJR Tobacco $ 7,945 $ 7,707 3.1 % Conwood 670 409 NM (3) All other 408 394 3.6 % Net sales 9,023 8,510 6.0 % Cost of products sold(1)(2) 4,960 4,803 3.3 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,687 1,658 1.7 % Amortization expense 23 28 (17.9 )% Restructuring and asset impairment charges 1 NM (3) Goodwill and trademark impairment charges 65 90 NM (3) Operating income: RJR Tobacco 1,940 1,682 15.3 % Conwood 312 181 NM (3) All other 142 165 (13.9 )% Corporate expense (106 ) (98 ) 8.2 % $ 2,288 $ 1,930 18.5 % 39 Table of Contents (1) Excludes excise taxes of: 2007 2006 RJR Tobacco $ 1,847 $ 1,966 Conwood 18 13 All other 161 145 $ 2,026 $ 2,124 (2) See below for further information related to MSA settlement and federal tobacco buyout expense included in cost of products sold. (3) Percentage change is not meaningful. RJR Tobacco Net Sales RJR Tobaccos net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007, increased $238 million from the prior year, primarily due to higher pricing coupled with lower discounting, partially offset by the impact of total volume decrease of $479 million. Domestic shipment volume, in billions of units for RJR Tobacco and the industry, were as follows(1): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Change Growth brands: CAMEL excluding non filter 24.2 23.5 3.1 % PALL MALL 7.1 6.4 10.3 % 31.3 29.9 4.7 % Support brands(2) 52.0 55.8 (6.8 )% Non support brands 14.3 18.3 (21.9 )% Total domestic 97.6 104.0 (6.2 )% Total premium 60.9 64.0 (4.8 )% Total value 36.7 40.0 (8.1 )% Premium/Total mix 62.4 % 61.6 % Industry(3): Premium 259.9 270.4 (3.9 )% Value 97.3 105.6 (7.9 )% Total domestic 357.2 376.0 (5.0 )% Premium/Total mix 72.8 % 71.9 % (1) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. Percentages are calculated on unrounded numbers. (2) During 2008, the KOOL brand was reclassified from a growth brand to a support brand. (3) Based on information from MSAi. Prior year amounts have been restated to reflect current methodology. RJR Tobaccos total domestic shipment volume decreased 6.2% in 2007 compared with the prior year, reflecting both a decline in total cigarette consumption and a decline in market share. RJR Tobaccos premium shipments as a percentage of total shipments increased during 2007 compared with the prior year, driven by CAMEL. CAMEL provided innovation with CAMEL No. 9 and CAMEL Signature 40 Table of Contents Blends, which were introduced during the first half of 2007, and the expansion to national distribution of two new CAMEL No. 9 styles in the third quarter of 2007. CAMELs menthol styles increased in popularity in 2007 as well. CAMEL Snus pioneered the development of a new category of smokeless, spitless tobacco products in the U.S. RJR Tobacco expanded the introduction of CAMEL Snus from two lead markets into six additional markets in 2007. The shares of RJR Tobaccos brands as a percentage of total share of U.S. retail cigarette sales according to data(1) from IRI, were as follows(2): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Share Point 2007 2006 Change Growth brands: CAMEL excluding non filter 7.8 % 7.4 % 0.4 PALL MALL 2.1 % 1.9 % 0.3 Total growth brands 9.9 % 9.3 % 0.6 Support brands 14.7 % 15.2 % (0.5 ) Non support brands 4.4 % 5.3 % (0.8 ) Total domestic 29.0 % 29.8 % (0.7 ) (1) Retail share of U.S. cigarette sales data is included in this document because it is used by RJR Tobacco primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants, and brands and market trends. You should not rely on the market share data reported by IRI as being a precise measurement of actual market share because IRI is not able to effectively track all volume. Moreover, you should be aware that in a product market experiencing overall declining consumption, a particular product can experience increasing market share relative to competing products, yet still be subject to declining consumption volumes. (2) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. The retail share of market of CAMELs filtered styles increased 0.4 share points in 2007 from 2006. CAMELs focus remained on brand innovation in 2007. In the first half of 2007, CAMEL introduced CAMEL Signature Blends, a collaborative effort with adult smokers. Also in the first half of 2007, CAMEL introduced CAMEL No. 9 in regular and menthol styles designed to appeal to adult female smokers. CAMEL No. 9, 100mm styles, were introduced during the third quarter of 2007. PALL MALLs market share continued to grow, gaining 0.3 share points in 2007 over 2006. PALL MALL offers a longer lasting cigarette with a premium heritage at a less than premium price. The combined share of market of RJR Tobaccos growth brands during 2007 showed improvement over the prior year. However, the decline in share of support and non support brands more than offset the gains on the growth brands. Operating Income RJR Tobaccos operating income for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased $258 million to $1,940 million, or 24.4% of net sales, from $1,682 million, or 21.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006. Improvements in pricing, product mix, productivity and pension expense were partially offset by volume declines and increased MSA settlement payments during 2007. In connection with the annual impairment testing of goodwill and certain intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2007, impairment of $33 million occurred on RJR Tobaccos non growth brand, WINSTON. The impairment primarily reflects lower projected net sales compared with that assumed in the 2006 annual impairment test. The impairment charge was based on the excess of the brands carrying value over its fair value using the present value of estimated future cash flows assuming a discount rate of 10.5%. 41 Table of Contents RJR Tobaccos MSA settlement and federal tobacco buyout expenses, included in cost of products sold, are detailed in the schedule below: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 2006 Settlements $ 2,791 $ 2,589 Federal tobacco quota buyout 247 258 Federal quota tobacco stock liquidation assessment (9 ) Total quota buyout expense $ 247 $ 249 For additional information, see Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Health Care Cost Recovery Cases MSA in Item 8, note 16 to consolidated financial statements and Governmental Activity below. Selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs of litigating and administering product liability claims, as well as other legal expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, RJR Tobaccos product liability defense costs were $88 million and $105 million, respectively. An improved litigation environment and efficient and effective management of cost contributed to the decline in product liability cost in 2007. Conwood Net Sales Conwoods net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007, were $670 million compared with $409 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The acquisition of the Conwood companies occurred on May 31, 2006, and consequently, the RAI consolidated statements of income include only the results of operations of the Conwood companies subsequent to May 31, 2006. Additionally, prior year comparative results of Lane operations that were transferred to Conwood on January 1, 2007, have been reclassified. The shares of Conwoods moist snuff products and volume discussion presented below include periods prior to the acquisition by RAI for enhanced analysis. The shipment volume, in millions of cans, for Conwood was as follows(1): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2007 2006 % Change Premium: KODIAK 53.2 56.7 (6.2 )% Other 3.2 3.5 (8.6 )% 56.4 60.2 (6.3 )% Price value: GRIZZLY 237.0 202.1 17.3 % Other 2.2 3.1 (29.0 )% 239.2 205.2 16.6 % Total moist snuff 295.6 265.4 11.4 % (1) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. 42 Table of Contents The Conwood shares of the moist snuff category as a percentage of total share of U.S. shipments of moist snuff, according to distributor reported data(1) processed by MSAi, were as follows(2): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Share 2007 2006 Point Change Premium: KODIAK 4.4 % 5.1 % (0.7 ) Other 0.3 % 0.3 % 4.7 % 5.4 % (0.7 ) Price value: GRIZZLY 21.1 % 19.4 % 1.7 Other 0.2 % 0.3 % (0.1 ) 21.3 % 19.7 % 1.6 Total moist snuff 26.0 % 25.1 % 0.9 (1) Distributor shipments to retail share of U.S. moist snuff is included in this document because it is used by Conwood primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants, and brands and market trends. You should not rely on the market share data reported by distributors and processed by MSAi as being a precise measurement of actual market share because this distributor data set is not able to effectively track all volume. (2) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. GRIZZLY, Conwoods leading price value moist snuff brand, had a market share of 21.1% of moist snuff shipments for 2007, an increase of 1.7 points from the prior year. Conwood completed its national roll out of GRIZZLY Long Cut Natural in the second quarter of 2007 and began testing two new GRIZZLY styles, GRIZZLY Wintergreen Pouches and GRIZZLY Snuff, to build on the brands momentum. GRIZZLY Wintergreen Pouches are moist snuff in a fleece pouch, and GRIZZLY Snuff is a traditional moist snuff style with an ultra fine cut. The shipment share of KODIAK, Conwoods leading premium moist snuff brand, was adversely impacted compared with the prior year due to competitive discounting and promotions. Operating Income Conwoods operating income for the year ended December 31, 2007, increased to $312 million, or 46.5% of net sales, from $181 million, or 44.4% of net sales, for the year ended December 31, 2006. A full year of the Conwood companies activities is the primary driver of the year over year increase. In addition, Conwood also benefited from higher volume and higher prices in 2007. In connection with the annual impairment testing of goodwill and certain intangible assets in the fourth quarter of 2007, impairment occurred on five of Conwoods non investment brands. The impairment primarily reflects a shift in the level of support among loose leaf product brands and for little cigar brands. In 2007, Conwood recorded impairment charges of $32 million based on the excess of certain brands carrying values over their fair values, using the present value of estimated future cash flows assuming a discount rate of 10.5%. All Other All Other sales for the year ended December 31, 2007, were favorably impacted by the growth of Santa Fes NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand. Operating income for 2007 was unfavorably impacted by an increase in corporate expenses as well as an increase in selling expenses associated with an increase in Santa Fes sales force. 43 Table of Contents RAI Consolidated Interest and debt expense was $338 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of $68 million over the prior year. This increase was primarily due to a full year of interest on the debt incurred by RAI to fund the acquisition of the Conwood companies in May 2006. Other expense (income) net was expense of $11 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Year to date foreign exchange gains and equity income were more than offset by the expensing of unamortized debt fees associated with the term loan that RAI pre paid in full in June 2007 and the loss on the sale of investment securities. For the year ended December 31, 2006, other income was $13 million consisting primarily of foreign exchange gain and equity income. Provision for income taxes was $766 million, or an effective rate of 37.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2007, compared with $673 million, or an effective rate of 37.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2006. The 2007 provision was favorably impacted by a decrease in nondeductible items and an increase in the Qualified Production Activity Income deduction. The 2006 provision was adversely impacted by nondeductible items, including certain expenditures related to ballot initiatives, offset by the resolution of certain prior years tax matters that resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of $17 million. Extraordinary item included a gain of $1 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, and $74 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, related to the 2000 acquisition of RJRs former parent, Nabisco Group Holdings Corp., referred to as NGH, primarily from settlement of tax matters. Including these adjustments, the net after tax gain on the acquisition of NGH was $1.8 billion. Liquidity and Financial Condition Liquidity At present, the principal sources of liquidity for RAIs operating subsidiaries businesses and operating needs are internally generated funds from their operations and intercompany loans and advances, mainly from RAI and RJR. The principal capital resources and sources of liquidity for RAI and RJR, in turn, are proceeds from issuances of debt securities by RAI and RJR and the RAI Credit Facility described below under Borrowing Arrangements. Cash flows from operating activities are believed to be sufficient for the foreseeable future to enable the operating subsidiaries to meet their obligations under the MSA, to fund their capital expenditures and to make payments to RAI and RJR that, when combined with RAIs and RJRs cash balances, will enable RAI and RJR to make their required debt service payments, and enable RAI to pay dividends to its shareholders. The negative impact, if any, on the sources of liquidity that could result from a decrease in demand for products due to short term inventory adjustments by wholesale and retail distributors, changes in competitive pricing, accelerated declines in consumption, particularly from increases in regulation or excise taxes, or adverse impacts from financial markets, cannot be predicted. RAI cannot predict its cash requirements or those of its subsidiaries related to any future settlements or judgments, including cash required to be held in escrow or to bond any appeals, if necessary, and RAI makes no assurance that it or its subsidiaries will be able to meet all of those requirements. RAI has evaluated the liquidity of key suppliers and significant customers in 2008. Where there were liquidity concerns identified with key suppliers, contingency plans are being developed. To date, no business interruptions have occurred caused by key supplier liquidity. No liquidity issues were identified regarding significant customers. As of December 31, 2008, RAI held investments primarily in money market funds, auction rate securities and mortgage backed securities. During 2008, certain money market funds were reclassified to short term investments from cash equivalents due to liquidity restrictions by the fund managers preventing immediate withdrawal. Given such restrictions, these funds will not be available until the underlying investments mature or are sold. Adverse changes in financial markets caused the auction rate securities and the mortgage backed security to revalue lower than carrying value and become less liquid. During 2008, the auction rate securities and mortgage backed security were reclassified to long term investments from short term investments as liquidation of these securities was not expected to occur within one year. The auction rate securities and mortgage backed security will not become liquid until a successful auction occurs or a buyer is found. RAI intends, and has the ability, to hold these money market 44 Table of Contents funds, auction rate securities and mortgage backed security for a period of time sufficient to allow for sale, redemption or anticipated recovery in fair value. At December 31, 2008, RAI considered the mortgage backed security, the auction rate securities linked to corporate credit risk and one of the auction rate securities related to financial insurance companies to be temporarily impaired. The remaining auction rate securities related to financial insurance companies were considered other than temporarily impaired by RAI at December 31, 2008. Contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 were as follows: Payments Due by Period Less than 1 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Total Year 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Long term notes, exclusive of interest(1) $ 4,410 $ 200 $ 700 $ 1,135 $ 2,375 Interest payments related to long term notes(1) 2,034 233 425 336 1,040 Operating leases(2) 68 16 26 18 8 Non qualified pension obligations(3) 67 6 13 13 35 Postretirement benefit obligations(3) 814 79 164 165 406 Qualified pension funding(3) 44 44 Purchase obligations(4) 905 141 287 194 283 Other noncurrent liabilities(5) 98 N/A 63 10 25 MSA obligations(6) 12,400 2,650 4,950 4,800 Gross unrecognized tax benefit(7) 97 Federal tobacco buyout obligations(8) 1,470 250 480 490 250 Total cash obligations $ 22,407 $ 3,619 $ 7,108 $ 7,161 $ 4,422 (1) For more information about RAIs long term notes, see Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. (2) Operating lease obligations represent estimated lease payments primarily related to office space, automobiles, warehouse space and computer equipment. See Item 8, note 16 to consolidated financial statements for additional information. (3) For more information about RAIs pension plans and postretirement benefits, see Item 8, note 19 to consolidated financial statements. Non qualified pension and postretirement benefit obligations captioned under Thereafter include obligations during the next five years only. These obligations are not reasonably estimable beyond ten years. Qualified pension plan funding is based on the Pension Protection Act and tax deductibility and is not reasonably estimable beyond one year. (4) Purchase obligations primarily include commitments to acquire tobacco leaf. Purchase orders for the purchase of other raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table. RAIs operating subsidiaries are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders typically represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. For purposes of this table, contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined by RAIs operating subsidiaries as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase orders of RAIs operating subsidiaries are based on current demand expectations and are fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons. RAIs operating subsidiaries do not have significant non cancelable agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods or services specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements. RAIs operating subsidiaries also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts were generally not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for the cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Other noncurrent liabilities include primarily restructuring and bonus compensation. Certain other noncurrent liabilities are excluded from the table above, including RJRs liabilities recorded in 1999 related to certain indemnification claims, for which timing of payments are not estimable. For more information about RJRs indemnification obligations, see Item 8, note 16 to consolidated financial statements. 45 Table of Contents (6) MSA obligation amounts in the aggregate beyond five years are not meaningful as these are obligations into perpetuity. For more information about the MSA, see Item 8, note 16 to consolidated financial statements. (7) Gross unrecognized tax benefit of $97 million relates to the adoption of FIN No. 48. For more information, see Item 8, note 12 to consolidated financial statements. Due to inherent uncertainties regarding the timing of payment of these amounts, RAI cannot reasonably estimate the payment period. (8) For more information about the tobacco buyout legislation, see Governmental Activity below and Item 8, note 16 to consolidated financial statements. Commitments as of December 31, 2008 were as follows: Commitment Expiration Period Less than Total 1 Year Standby letters of credit backed by revolving credit facility $ 12 $ 12 Total commitments $ 12 $ 12 Cash Flows 2008 Compared with 2007 Net cash flows from operating activities were $1,315 million in 2008, compared with $1,331 million in 2007. This change was driven primarily by higher MSA and tax payments, partially offset by lower pension funding in 2008. Net cash flows from investing activities were $278 million in 2008, compared with $763 million for the prior year. This change was primarily driven by higher short term investing net proceeds in 2007 that more than offset the proceeds received as a result of the termination of the joint venture in 2008. Net cash flows used in financing activities were $1,206 million in 2008, compared with $1,312 million in 2007. This change was due to prior year repayment of long term debt, offset by higher stock repurchases and higher dividends per share in 2008. 2007 Compared with 2006 Net cash flows from operating activities were $1,331 million in 2007, compared with net cash flows from operating activities of $1,457 million in 2006. This decrease was the result of higher income tax and interest payments in 2007, partially offset by increased net income in 2007. Net cash flows from investing activities were $763 million in 2007, compared with net cash flows used in investing activities of $3,531 million in 2006. This change was primarily driven by the acquisition of the Conwood companies in 2006 and higher net proceeds from the sale of short term investments in 2007. Net cash flows used in financing activities were $1,312 million in 2007, compared with net cash flows provided by financing activities of $2,174 million in 2006. This change reflects prior year RAI debt issuances related to the acquisition of the Conwood companies, as well as increased dividend payments, long term debt repayment and repurchase of RAI common stock in 2007. Borrowing Arrangements As of December 31, 2008, RAIs total consolidated debt consisted of RAI notes in the aggregate principal amount of $4.3 billion, with maturity dates ranging from 2009 to 2037, and RJR notes in the aggregate principal amount of $129 million, with maturity dates ranging from 2009 to 2015. See Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements for more information on these notes. RAI and RJR use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on a portion of their debt obligations. Under certain conditions, any fair value that results in a liability position of certain interest rate swaps may require full collateralization with cash or securities. On December 31, 2008, interest rate swaps existed on $1.6 billion of fixed 46 Table of Contents rate notes. When entered into, these swaps were designated as hedges of underlying exposures. On January 6, 2009, RAI and RJR entered into offsetting interest rate swap agreements in the notional amount of $1.5 billion with maturity dates ranging from June 1, 2012 to June 15, 2017. These swaps were entered into with the same financial institution that holds notional amount of $1.5 billion of current swaps and have a technical right of offset. The future cash flows, established as a result of entering into the January 6, 2009, swaps, totals $321 million, and will be amortized and effectively reduce net interest costs over the remaining life of the notes. Concurrent with entering the swap agreements on January 6, 2009, RAI de designated the current swaps as fair value hedges. On January 7, 2009, RAI and RJR terminated an interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of $100 million with a maturity date of June 1, 2012. The resulting gain of approximately $12 million will be amortized to effectively reduce interest expense over the remaining life of the notes. As a result of these actions, RAI and RJR have effectively converted $1.6 billion of fixed rate notes swapped to a variable rate of interest, to a fixed rate of interest of approximately 4.0%. At their option, RAI and RJR, as applicable, may redeem any or all of their outstanding fixed rate notes, in whole or in part at any time, subject to the payment of a make whole premium. RAIs floating rate notes are redeemable at par on any interest payment date after December 15, 2008. On June 28, 2007, RAI entered into the Credit Facility, which provides for a five year, $550 million revolving credit facility, which may be increased to $900 million at the discretion of the lenders upon the request of RAI. The Credit Facilitys maturity date of June 28, 2012, may be extended by one year, at the discretion of the lenders upon RAIs request. Lenders and their respective commitments in the Credit Facility, which are several, not joint, commitments, are listed below: Lender Commitment JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. $ 52.89 Citibank N.A. 52.89 Morgan Stanley Bank 52.00 Lehman Commercial Paper Inc. (LCPI) 52.00 Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd. 52.00 General Electric Capital Corporation 52.00 AG First Farm Credit Bank 52.00 Goldman Sachs Bank USA 35.00 Wachovia Bank, National Association 35.00 The Bank of Nova Scotia 35.00 The Bank of New York 35.00 Farm Credit Services of Minnesota Valley, PCA DBA FCS Commercial Finance Group 20.00 City National Bank of New Jersey 14.22 Farm Credit Bank of Texas 10.00 $ 550.00 At December 31, 2008, RAI had $12 million in letters of credit outstanding under the Credit Facility. At such date, no borrowings were outstanding, and the remaining $538 million of the Credit Facility was available for borrowing. On December 31, 2008, Wells Fargo Company completed its merger with Wachovia Corporation, the parent company of Wachovia Bank, National Association, pursuant to which Wells Fargo acquired all of Wachovia Corporation and all its businesses and its obligations. 47 Table of Contents On October 5, 2008, LCPI filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code. RAI has never borrowed under the Credit Facility, but given LCPIs bankruptcy filing, there can be no assurance that LCPI would loan LCPIs pro rata share of any borrowing requests made by RAI. Subject to the terms and conditions in the Credit Facility, RAI has the right to replace a lender in certain circumstances, including upon a lender defaulting in its obligation to make loans. If any lender were to default in its obligation to make loans, there can be no assurance as to when or whether RAI could find an acceptable replacement lender. Certain of RAIs subsidiaries, including the Guarantors, have guaranteed RAIs obligations under the Credit Facility and under RAIs outstanding senior notes, referred to as the Notes. During the second quarter of 2008, the collateral securing the Credit Facility, Notes and related guarantees was released as a result of certain corporate credit ratings actions by SP and Moodys. The collateral for the Credit Facility, Notes and related guarantees will be reinstated if RAIs corporate credit rating issued by each of SP and Moodys is lowered to at least one level below the lowest rating level established as investment grade, or if RAIs corporate credit rating issued by either SP or Moodys is lowered to at least two levels below the lowest rating level established as investment grade. For more information on the release of collateral, see note 13 to consolidated financial statements. Prior to the credit ratings actions described above, RAI had pledged substantially all of its assets, including the stock of its direct subsidiaries, to secure its obligations under the Credit Facility, and the Guarantors had pledged substantially all of their assets to secure their guarantees of RAIs obligations under the Credit Facility. Also prior to such credit ratings actions, the Notes and related guarantees had been secured by any Principal Property, as such term is defined in the indenture governing the Notes, of RAI and certain of the Guarantors, and the stock, indebtedness or other obligations of RJR Tobacco. Concerns about, or lowering of, RAIs ratings by SP or Moodys could have an adverse impact on RAIs ability to access the debt markets and could increase borrowing costs. However, given the cash balances and operating performance of RAI and its subsidiaries, RAIs management believes that such concerns about, or lowering of, such ratings would not have a material adverse impact on RAIs cash flows. RAI, RJR and their affiliates were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions imposed by their indebtedness at December 31, 2008. Dividends On February 3, 2009, RAIs board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.85 per common share. The dividend will be paid on April 1, 2009, to shareholders of record as of March 10, 2009. On an annualized basis, the dividend rate is $3.40 per common share. The current dividend reflects RAIs policy of paying dividends to the holders of RAIs common stock in an aggregate amount that is approximately 75% of RAIs annual consolidated net income. Stock Repurchases On April 29, 2008, RAIs board of directors authorized RAIs repurchase, from time to time on or before April 30, 2009, of up to $350 million of outstanding shares of RAI common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions. The repurchases are subject to prevailing market and business conditions, and the program may be terminated or suspended at any time. In connection with the share repurchase program, RAI and BW entered into an agreement, pursuant to which BW has agreed to participate in the repurchase program on a basis approximately proportionate with BWs 42% ownership of RAIs equity. This repurchase program supersedes the $30 million repurchase program authorized by RAIs board of directors on February 5, 2008, to offset the dilution from shares issued under certain equity based benefit plans. Due to RAIs incorporation in North Carolina, which does not recognize treasury shares, the shares repurchased are cancelled at the time of repurchase. As of December 31, 2008, RAI had repurchased and cancelled 3,817,095 shares of RAI common stock for $207 million under the above share repurchase programs. To preserve liquidity, RAI did not make any stock purchases under the repurchase program in the fourth quarter of 2008. 48 Table of Contents Additionally during 2008, at a cost of $3 million, RAI purchased 57,223 shares that were forfeited with respect to tax liabilities associated with restricted stock vesting under its LTIP. Capital Expenditures RAIs operating subsidiaries recorded cash capital expenditures of $113 million, $142 million and $136 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Of the 2008 amount, $62 million related to RJR Tobacco and $34 million related to Conwood. RJR Tobacco plans to spend $60 million to $70 million for capital expenditures during 2009, primarily on non discretionary business requirements, and Conwood plans to spend $100 million to $110 million in 2009, primarily on non discretionary capacity expansion. Capital expenditures are funded primarily by cash flows from operations. RAIs operating subsidiaries capital expenditure programs are expected to continue at a level sufficient to support their strategic and operating needs. There were no material long term commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2008. Retirement Benefits Due to the adverse changes in the financial markets, RAIs pension assets have been negatively impacted. In 2008, the overall rate of return on the investments for the pension assets was approximately negative 30.1%. RAI assessed the asset allocation and investment strategy and will phase in appropriate changes to balance funded status, interest rate risk and asset returns. Once fully implemented, these changes will reduce the pension funds exposure to equities and increase exposure to fixed income and alternatives. As a result of changes to the asset allocation and investment strategy, RAI lowered the expected long term return on pension assets, referred to as the ELTRA, to 8.25%, beginning in 2009, from 8.74% . The ELTRA, asset allocation, current asset performance and the discount rate may impact the funded status of RAIs pension plans, and as a result RAI will contribute a minimum of $50 million to the pension assets in 2009 and pension expense will increase approximately $180 million in 2009. Litigation and Settlements As discussed in Item 8, note 16 to consolidated financial statements, RJR Tobacco, the Conwood companies and their affiliates, including RAI, and indemnitees, including BW, have been named in a number of tobacco related legal actions, proceedings or claims seeking damages in amounts ranging into the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. Unfavorable judgments have been returned in a number of tobacco related cases and state enforcement actions. As of February 6, 2009, RJR Tobacco has paid approximately $12 million since January 1, 2006, related to unfavorable judgments. RJR, including its subsidiary RJR Tobacco, have liabilities totaling $94 million that were recorded in connection with certain indemnification claims, not related to smoking and health, asserted by JTI against RJR and RJR Tobacco, relating to the activities of Northern Brands and related litigation. RAIs management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees, or the loss of any particular claim concerning the use of smokeless tobacco against the Conwood companies, when viewed on an individual basis, is not probable. RAI and its subsidiaries believe that they have valid basis for appeal of adverse verdicts against them and have valid defenses to all actions and intend to defend all actions vigorously. Nonetheless, the possibility of material losses related to tobacco litigation is more than remote. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and generally it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against RJR Tobacco, the Conwood companies or their affiliates or indemnitees, or to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss. Moreover, notwithstanding the quality of defenses available to it and its affiliates in tobacco related litigation matters, it is possible that RAIs consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of certain pending or future litigation matters. In November 1998, RJR Tobacco, BW and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers entered into the MSA with attorneys general representing most U.S. states, territories and possessions. As described in Item 8, note 16 to consolidated financial statements, the MSA imposes a perpetual stream of future payment obligations on RJR Tobacco and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers and places significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell cigarettes in the future. For more information related to historical and expected settlement expenses 49 Table of Contents and payments under the MSA, see Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Health Care Cost Recovery Cases MSA in Item 8, note 16 to consolidated financial statements. The MSA has materially adversely affected RJR Tobaccos shipment volumes. RAI believes that these settlement obligations may materially adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of RAI and RJR Tobacco in future periods. The degree of the adverse impact will depend, among other things, on the rate of decline in U.S. cigarette sales in the premium and value categories, RJR Tobaccos share of the domestic premium and value cigarette categories, and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to the MSA. RJR Tobacco and certain of the other participating manufacturers under the MSA are currently involved in litigation with the settling states with respect to the availability for certain market years of a downward adjustment to the annual MSA settlement payment obligation, known as the Non Participating Manufacturer Adjustment. Pending the resolution of these disputes, RJR Tobacco and certain of the other participating manufacturers have placed the disputed portions of their 2006, 2007 and 2008 annual payments into the MSA disputed funds account. RJR Tobacco currently has approximately $1.6 billion deposited in the MSA disputed funds account. For more information related to this litigation, see Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry MSA Enforcement and Validity in Item 8, note 16 to consolidated financial statements. Governmental Activity The marketing, sale, taxation and use of tobacco products have been subject to substantial regulation by government and health officials for many years. Various state governments have adopted or are considering, among other things, legislation and regulations that would: significantly increase their taxes on tobacco products; restrict displays, advertising and sampling of tobacco products; establish fire standards compliance for cigarettes; raise the minimum age to possess or purchase tobacco products; restrict or ban the use of certain flavorings, including menthol, in tobacco products, or the use of certain flavor descriptors in the marketing of tobacco products; require the disclosure of ingredients used in the manufacture of tobacco products; require the disclosure of nicotine yield information for cigarettes; impose restrictions on smoking in public and private areas; and restrict the sale of tobacco products directly to consumers or other unlicensed recipients, including over the Internet. In addition, during 2009, the U.S. Congress adopted legislation increasing the federal excise tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products, and likely will consider legislation regarding the regulation of the manufacture and sale of tobacco products by the FDA. The U.S. Congress also may consider legislation regarding: regulation of environmental tobacco smoke; implementation of a national fire standards compliance for cigarettes; regulation of the retail sale of tobacco products over the Internet and in other non face to face retail transactions, such as by mail order and telephone; and banning of the delivery of tobacco products by the U.S. Postal Service. Together with manufacturers price increases in recent years and substantial increases in state and federal taxes on tobacco products, these developments have had and will likely continue to have an adverse effect on the sale of tobacco products. 50 Table of Contents Cigarettes are subject to substantial excise taxes in the United States. The federal excise tax per pack of 20 cigarettes is currently $0.39. On February 4, 2009, President Obama signed an increase of $0.62 in the excise tax per pack of cigarettes, and significant tax increases on other tobacco products, to fund expansion of the SCHIP. The tax increases are effective April 1, 2009. Under the SCHIP, the tax rate for chewing tobacco will increase $0.3083 per pound to $0.5033 per pound and will increase $0.925 per pound to $1.51 per pound for snuff. The federal tax on small cigars, defined as those weighing three pounds or less per thousand, will increase $48.502 per thousand to $50.33 per thousand. Large cigars currently are taxed at a rate of 20.719% of the manufacturers price, with a cap of $48.75 per thousand. Under the SCHIP, the rate on large cigars will increase to 52.75% of the manufacturers price, with a maximum rate of $0.4026 per cigar. In addition, the tax rate for roll your own tobacco will increase from $1.097 per pound to $24.78 per pound. RAIs operating subsidiaries expect the tax increases to significantly and adversely impact sales volume, but at this time, cannot quantify the sales volume decline, nor the resulting adverse impacts to RAIs consolidated results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Additionally, RAIs operating subsidiaries believe that the federal excise tax increase is an event that will require that their goodwill and trademarks be tested for impairment during the first quarter of 2009, and the resulting fair value of certain of their trademarks could be less than carrying value. In particular, RJR Tobacco believes that impairment charges related to support and non support cigarette brands are possible and Conwood also believes that impairment charges related to certain brands are possible. No reasonable estimate of trademark impairment charges can be made at this time by RAIs operating subsidiaries. Because annual impairment testing of the goodwill of RAIs operating subsidiaries as of November 30, 2008, indicated significant excesses of fair value over carrying value, RAIs operating subsidiaries believe that goodwill impairment as a result of testing in the first quarter of 2009 is unlikely. All states and the District of Columbia currently impose excise taxes at levels ranging from $0.07 per pack in South Carolina to $2.75 per pack in New York. As of December 31, 2008, the weighted average state cigarette excise tax per pack, calculated on a 12 month rolling average basis, was approximately $1.011, an increase compared to the 12 month rolling average of $0.914 as of December 31, 2007. Three states passed excise tax per pack increases in 2008: New York, a $1.25 increase, from $1.50 to $2.75 per pack, effective June 3, 2008; Massachusetts, a $1.00 increase, from $1.51 to $2.51 per pack, effective July 1, 2008; and New Hampshire, a $0.25 increase, from $1.08 to $1.33 per pack, effective October 15, 2008. In addition, on January 1, 2008, the cigarette excise tax increased by $1.00 per pack in two states as a result of legislation passed in 2007: Maryland, from $1.00 to $2.00, and Wisconsin, from $0.77 to $1.77. On July 1, 2008, Vermont increased its cigarette excise tax rate by $0.20, to $1.99 per pack, the result of an increase passed in 2006 and implemented in 2006 and 2008. Hawaii increased its cigarette excise tax on September 30, 2008, as a result of a $1.20 tax passed in 2006, which is being implemented in $0.20 increments until 2011. Certain city and county governments, such as New York and Chicago, also impose substantial excise taxes on cigarettes sold in those jurisdictions. The District of Columbia passed a $1.00 per pack increase, from $1.00 to $2.00, effective October 1, 2008. Cigars are generally taxed by states on an ad valorem basis, ranging from 5% in South Carolina to 75% in Alaska and Washington. Other states have unit based tax schemes for cigars or tax little cigars the same as cigarettes. Forty nine states also subject smokeless tobacco to excise taxes and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, which currently levies no tax on other tobacco products, considered one during its 2008 legislative session. As of December 31, 2008, 35 states taxed moist snuff, and 46 states taxed chewing tobacco, on an ad valorem basis at rates that range from 5% in South Carolina to 90% in Massachusetts. Other states have a unit tax or a weight based tax. In 2008, two states passed legislation that changed their tax on moist snuff from an ad valorem tax to a weight based tax: Utahs tax changed from 35% to $0.75 per ounce, and New Yorks tax changed from 37% to $0.96 per ounce, both effective July 1, 2008. Legislation to convert from an ad valorem to a weight based tax is expected to be introduced in several other states in 2009. 51 Table of Contents On October 25, 2006, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau of the U.S. Department of Treasury, referred to as the TTB, issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, proposing changes to the regulations that govern the classification and labeling of cigars and cigarettes for federal excise tax purposes. The TTB now is considering written comments that were received prior to the March 26, 2007, deadline. Both the CAPTAIN BLACK and WINCHESTER little cigar brands manufactured by Lane, which are classified and sold as little cigars, would be re classified as cigarettes under these proposed regulations. Although it is not possible to fully assess and quantify the negative impact of the proposed regulations, if adopted, on the little cigar products of Lane, the immediate impact would be to increase the federal excise tax on such products by more than tenfold. In addition, if little cigars are classified as cigarettes for federal excise tax purposes, it is possible that the states would take the position that MSA obligations also apply to these products. In 1964, the Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service concluded that cigarette smoking was a health hazard of sufficient importance to warrant appropriate remedial action. Since 1966, federal law has required a warning statement on cigarette packaging, and cigarette advertising in other media also is required to contain a warning statement. Since 1971, television and radio advertising of cigarettes has been prohibited in the United States. During the past four decades, various laws affecting the cigarette industry have been enacted. In 1984, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act. Among other things, this act: establishes an interagency committee on smoking and health that is charged with carrying out a program to inform the public of any dangers to human health presented by cigarette smoking; requires a series of four health warnings to be printed on cigarette packages and advertising on a rotating basis; increases type size and area of the warning required in cigarette advertisements; and requires that cigarette manufacturers provide annually, on a confidential basis, a list of ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The warnings currently required on cigarette packages and advertisements are: SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease, Emphysema, And May Complicate Pregnancy; SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Quitting Smoking Now Greatly Reduces Serious Risks to Your Health; SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Smoking By Pregnant Women May Result in Fetal Injury, Premature Birth, And Low Birth Weight; and SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon Monoxide. Since the initial report in 1964, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, now the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Surgeon General have issued a number of other reports which purport to find the nicotine in cigarettes addictive and to link cigarette smoking and exposure to cigarette smoke with certain health hazards, including various types of cancer, coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive lung disease. These reports have recommended various governmental measures to reduce the incidence of smoking. In 1992, the federal Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Act was signed into law. This act required states to adopt a minimum age of 18 for purchase of tobacco products and to establish a system to monitor, report and reduce the illegal sale of tobacco products to minors in order to continue receiving federal funding for mental health and drug abuse programs. In 1996, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced regulations implementing this legislation. And in 2006, the Surgeon General released a report entitled The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke. Among its conclusions, the report found the following: exposure of adults to secondhand smoke causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer, exposure of children to secondhand smoke 52 Table of Contents results in an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome, acute respiratory infections, ear problems and more severe asthma; and that there is no risk free level of exposure to secondhand smoke. In 1986, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986, which, among other things, required health warning notices on smokeless tobacco packages and advertising and prohibited the advertising of smokeless tobacco products on any medium of electronic communications subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission. The warnings currently required on smokeless tobacco packages and advertising, which appear on a rotating basis, are: WARNING: THIS PRODUCT MAY CAUSE MOUTH CANCER; WARNING: THIS PRODUCT MAY CAUSE GUM DISEASE AND TOOTH LOSS; and WARNING: THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO CIGARETTES. In 2000, the seven largest U.S. cigar companies, including Lane, entered into agreements with the FTC, to clearly and conspicuously display on virtually every cigar package and advertisement one of the following warnings, which appear on a rotating basis: SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Cigar Smoking Can Cause Cancers Of The Mouth And Throat, Even If You Do Not Inhale; SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Cigar Smoking Can Cause Lung Cancer And Heart Disease; SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Tobacco Use Increases The Risk Of Infertility, Stillbirth And Low Birth Weight; SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Cigars Are Not A Safe Alternative To Cigarettes; and SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Tobacco Smoke Increases The Risk Of Lung Cancer And Heart Disease, Even In Nonsmokers. A bill that would grant the FDA authority to regulate tobacco products was introduced in Congress in February 2007. On July 30, 2008, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill by a vote of 326 102. The U.S. Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee approved the FDA regulation bill on August 1, 2007, but the Senate adjourned in 2008 without any further action on the bill. In 2009, it is likely that Congress will again take up the issue of FDA regulation of tobacco products. It is anticipated that any proposed FDA regulation bill most likely would: Require larger and more severe health warnings on packs and cartons; Ban the use of descriptors on tobacco products, such as low tar and light; Require the disclosure of ingredients and additives to consumers; Require pre market approval by the FDA for claims made with respect to reduced risk or reduced exposure products; Allow the FDA to require the reduction of nicotine and the reduction or elimination of any other compound in tobacco products; Prohibit the use of foreign grown tobacco that has been grown or processed with pesticides not approved under federal law for use in domestic tobacco farming and processing; Allow the FDA to place more severe restrictions on the advertising, marketing and sale of cigarettes; Permit inconsistent state regulation of labeling and advertising and eliminate the existing federal preemption of such regulation; and Grant the FDA the regulatory authority to impose broad additional restrictions. It is possible that such additional regulation could result in a decrease in cigarette and smokeless tobacco sales in the United States, including sales of RJR Tobaccos and Conwoods brands, and an increase in costs to RJR 53 Table of Contents Tobacco and Conwood which may have a material adverse effect on RAIs financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows. RAI believes that such regulation may adversely affect the ability of its operating subsidiaries to compete against their larger competitor, Philip Morris USA, Inc., who may be able to more quickly and cost effectively comply with these new rules and regulations. On November 26, 2008, the FTC rescinded its guidance, issued in 1966, indicating that factual statements of tar and nicotine yields based on the Cambridge Filter Method generally would not violate the FTC Act. In light of the rescission, the FTC has stated that advertisers should not use terms such as per FTC method or other phrases that would suggest the FTC endorses or approves the Cambridge Filter Method or other machine based test methods. In its notice, the FTC did not directly address whether its decision prohibited the use of descriptors such as light and ultra low, citing the fact that the trial judge in the RICO lawsuit brought by the U.S. Department of Justice against the cigarette manufacturer has already determined that such descriptors should be banned and that that determination, among others, is currently before the D.C. Circuit of Appeals. In terms of enforcing the rescission, the FTC has stated that it would not consider challenging any packaging, advertising or marketing materials that conformed to the 1966 guidance prior to January 1, 2009 and, in any event, would not challenge actions taken in reliance on that guidance where altering or withdrawing the material would be impracticable. RAIs operating companies have assessed the steps necessary to comply with the FTC notice and will be implementing these changes in 2009. Legislation imposing various restrictions on public smoking also has been enacted by 49 states and many local jurisdictions, and many employers have initiated programs restricting or eliminating smoking in the workplace. A number of states have enacted legislation designating a portion of increased cigarette excise taxes to fund either anti smoking programs, health care programs or cancer research. In addition, educational and research programs addressing health care issues related to smoking are being funded from industry payments made or to be made under settlements with state attorneys general. Federal law prohibits smoking in scheduled passenger aircraft, and the U.S. Interstate Commerce Commission has banned smoking on buses transporting passengers interstate. Certain common carriers have imposed additional restrictions on passenger smoking. In 2003, the California Environmental Protection Agency Air Resources Board issued a Proposed Identification of Environmental Tobacco Smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant for public review. In 2006, the Air Resources Board identified environmental tobacco smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant, following a three year administrative process. The Air Resources Board is now required to prepare a report assessing the need and appropriate degree of control of environmental tobacco smoke. RJR Tobacco cannot predict the form any future California regulation may take. In 2003, the New York Office of Fire Prevention and Control issued a final standard with accompanying regulations that requires all cigarettes offered for sale in New York State after June 28, 2004, to achieve specified test results when placed on ten layers of filter paper in controlled laboratory conditions. The cigarettes that RAIs operating companies sell in New York State comply with this standard. As of December 31, 2008, 36 states in addition to New York, as well as Washington, D.C., had enacted fire standards compliance legislation of their own, adopting the same testing standard set forth in the OFPC regulations described above. Similar legislation is being considered in a number of other states and Washington, D.C. Consistent with these state legislative trends and its effort to increase productivity and reduce complexity, on October 25, 2007, RJR Tobacco announced its plans to voluntarily convert all its brands to fire standards compliant paper by the end of 2009. Varying standards from state to state could have an adverse effect on the business or results of operations of RJR Tobacco. In July 2007, the State of Maine became the first state to enact a statute that prohibits the sale of cigarettes and cigars that have a characterizing flavor. The legislation defines characterizing flavor as a distinguishable taste or aroma that is imparted to tobacco or tobacco smoke either prior to or during consumption, other than a taste or aroma from tobacco, menthol, clove, coffee, nuts or peppers. In October 2008, the State of New Jersey passed a similar ban on flavored cigarettes with a similar definition of characterizing flavor but excluding only tobacco, menthol or clove. Additionally, New Jersey extended the ban not only to whether the product itself has a characterizing flavor as part of the aroma of the product or smoke, but also if the product was marketed or advertised as producing such a flavor, taste or aroma. Similar bills are pending in other states. 54 Table of Contents Effective October 1, 2008, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors adopted a ban on the sale of tobacco products in some pharmacies. The Boston Public Health Commission instituted a similar ban on February 9, 2009. A price differential exists between cigarettes manufactured for sale abroad and cigarettes manufactured for sale in the United States. Consequently, a domestic gray market has developed in cigarettes manufactured for sale abroad, but instead diverted for domestic sales that compete with cigarettes that RJR Tobacco manufactures for domestic sale. The U.S. federal government and all states, except Massachusetts, have enacted legislation prohibiting the sale and distribution of gray market cigarettes. In addition, RJR Tobacco has taken legal action against distributors and retailers who engage in such practices. RJR Tobacco expects to benefit from certain state legislative activity aimed at leveling the playing field between original participating manufacturers under the MSA and nonparticipating manufacturers under the MSA, referred to as NPMs. Forty six states have passed legislation to ensure NPMs are making required escrow payments. Under this legislation, a state would only permit distribution of brands by manufacturers who are deemed by the states to be MSA compliant. Failure to make escrow payments could result in the loss of an NPMs ability to sell tobacco products in a respective state. Additionally, 44 states have enacted legislation that closes a loophole in the MSA. The loophole allows NPMs that concentrate their sales in a single state, or a limited number of states, to recover most of the funds from their escrow accounts. To obtain the refunds, the manufacturers must establish that their escrow deposit was greater than the amount the state would have received had the manufacturer been a subsequent participating manufacturer under the MSA, that is, the states allocable share. The National Association of Attorneys General, referred to as NAAG, has endorsed adoption of the allocable share legislation needed to eliminate this loophole. Following a challenge by NPMs, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York has issued an order enjoining New York from enforcing allocable share legislation. It is possible that NPMs will challenge allocable share legislation passed in other states. Finally, four states, Alaska, Michigan, Minnesota and Utah, have enacted equity assessments on NPMs products. This legislative initiative has not been endorsed by NAAG, and one NPM has filed a challenge to the equity assessment in Michigan. Forty two states by statute or court rule have limited, and several additional states are considering limiting, the amount of the bonds required to file an appeal of an adverse judgment in state court. The limitation on the amount of such bonds generally ranges from $1 million to $150 million. Bonding statutes in 37 states allow defendants that are subject to large adverse judgments, such as cigarette manufacturers, to reasonably bond such judgments and pursue the appellate process. In five other states and Puerto Rico, the filing of a notice of appeal automatically stays the judgment of the trial court. In 2003, the World Health Organization adopted a broad tobacco control treaty. The treaty recommends and requires enactment of legislation establishing specific actions to prevent youth smoking, restrict and gradually eliminate tobacco products marketing, provide greater regulation and disclosure of ingredients, increase the size and scope of package warning labels to cover at least 30% of each package and include graphic pictures on packages. The treaty entered into force on February 27, 2005 90 days after ratification by the 40th country. In February 2006, the first session of the Conference of the Parties, referred to as the COP, occurred in Geneva, Switzerland. The COP, among other actions taken, established a permanent secretariat, adopted a budget, and created working groups to begin to develop protocols on cross border advertising and illegal trade and guidelines on establishing smoke free places and regulating tobacco products. Among the decisions taken at the COPs second session, in July 2007, the COP adopted guidelines from the working group on the protection from exposure to tobacco smoke and called for an intergovernmental negotiating body to negotiate a protocol on illicit trade. At the COPs third conference, in November 2008, the parties adopted guidelines with respect to various provisions of the tobacco control treaty, including the packaging and labeling of tobacco products. The fourth COP session is scheduled to be held in Uruguay in late 2010. Although the U.S. delegate to the World Health Organization voted for the treaty in May 2003, and the Secretary for Health and Human Services signed the document in May 2004, the Bush Administration did not send the treaty to the U.S. Senate for ratification. Ratification by the United States could lead to broader regulation of the industry. 55 Table of Contents It is not possible to determine what additional federal, state or local legislation or regulations relating to smoking or cigarettes will be enacted or to predict the effect of new legislation or regulations on RJR Tobacco or the cigarette industry in general, but any new legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on RJR Tobacco or the cigarette industry in general. Similarly, it is not possible to determine what additional federal, state or local legislation or regulations relating to smokeless tobacco products will be enacted or to predict the effect of new regulation on Conwood or smokeless tobacco products in general, but any new legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on Conwood or smokeless tobacco products in general.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. RAI and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to their normal investing and funding activities. In addition, RAI and its subsidiaries have immaterial exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk concerning obligations for, and service agreements related to, foreign operations denominated in euros, British pounds, Swiss francs, Chinese renminbi and Japanese yen. RAI and its subsidiaries have established policies and procedures to manage their exposure to market risks and use major institutions as counterparties to minimize their investment and credit risk. Frequently, these institutions are also members of the bank group that provide RAI credit, and management believes this further minimizes the risk of nonperformance. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes. 57 Table of Contents The table below provides information about RAIs financial instruments, as of December 31, 2008, that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. The table presents notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates for the years ending December 31: Fair 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total Value(1) Investments: Variable Rate $ 2,555 $ 28 $ 48 $ 2,631 $ 2,631 Average Interest Rate 0.4 % 1.1 % 3.0 % 0.4 % Fixed Rate $ 4 $ 4 $ 4 Average Interest Rate(2) 4.7 % 4.7 % Debt: Fixed Rate $ 200 $ 300 $ 450 $ 685 $ 2,375 $ 4,010 $ 3,391 Average Interest Rate(2) 7.9 % 6.5 % 7.3 % 7.4 % 7.3 % 7.3 % Variable Rate $ 400 $ 400 $ 342 Average Interest Rate(2) 2.7 % 2.7 % Swaps: Notional Amount(3) $ 450 $ 1,150 $ 1,600 $ 287 Average Variable Interest Pay Rate(2) 4.5 % 2.8 % 3.2 % Average Fixed Interest Receive Rate(2) 7.3 % 7.1 % 7.1 % (1) Fair values are based on current market rates available or on rates available for instruments with similar terms and maturities and quoted fair values. (2) Based upon contractual interest rates for fixed rate indebtedness or current market rates for LIBOR plus negotiated spreads until maturity for variable rate indebtedness. (3) As of December 31, 2008, RAI had swapped $1.6 billion of fixed rate debt to variable rate debt. RAIs exposure to foreign currency transactions was not material to results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2008, but may become material in future periods in relation to activity associated with RAIs international operations. RAI currently has no hedges for its exposure to foreign currency. See Liquidity and Financial Condition in Item 7 for additional information. 58 Table of Contents
