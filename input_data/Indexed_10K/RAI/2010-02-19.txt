Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following is a discussion and analysis of RAIs business, initiatives, critical accounting policies and its consolidated results of operations and financial position. Following the overview and discussion of business initiatives, the critical accounting policies disclose certain accounting policies that are material to RAIs results of operations and financial position for the periods presented in this report. The discussion and analysis of RAIs results of operations is presented in two comparative sections, 2009 compared with 2008, and 2008 compared with 2007. Disclosures related to liquidity and financial position complete managements discussion and analysis. You should read this discussion and analysis of RAIs consolidated financial position and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, and for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2009. Overview and Business Initiatives RAIs reportable operating segments are RJR Tobacco and Conwood. The RJR Tobacco segment consists of the primary operations of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. The Conwood segment consists of Conwood Holdings, Inc., the primary operations of the Conwood companies and Lane. Two of RAIs wholly owned subsidiaries, Santa Fe and Niconovum AB, among others, are included in All Other. RAIs wholly owned operating subsidiaries have entered into intercompany agreements for products or services with other RAI operating subsidiaries. As a result, certain activities of an operating subsidiary may be included in a different segment of RAI. RAIs largest reportable operating segment, RJR Tobacco, is the second largest cigarette manufacturer in the United States. RJR Tobaccos largest selling cigarette brands, CAMEL, PALL MALL, WINSTON, KOOL and DORAL, were five of the ten best selling brands of cigarettes in the United States as of December 31, 2009. Those brands, and its other brands, including SALEM, MISTY and CAPRI, are manufactured in a variety of styles and marketed in the United States. RJR Tobacco also manages contract manufacturing of cigarettes and tobacco products through arrangements with BAT affiliates. RAIs other reportable operating segment, Conwood, is the second largest smokeless tobacco products manufacturer in the United States. Conwoods primary brands include its largest selling moist snuff brands, GRIZZLY, the best selling brand of moist snuff in the United States as of December 31, 2009, and KODIAK. Conwood also distributes a variety of other tobacco products, including WINCHESTER and CAPTAIN BLACK little cigars, and BUGLER roll your own tobacco. Santa Fe manufactures and markets cigarettes and other tobacco products under the NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand, as well as manages super premium brands licensed from BAT, including DUNHILL and STATE EXPRESS 555. In January 2009, the activities of GPI were transitioned to other operating subsidiaries of RAI. The management and export of tobacco products sold to certain U.S. territories, U.S. duty free shops and U.S. overseas military bases was transferred to RJR Tobacco and sales of NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT in Europe and Japan were transferred to other indirect subsidiaries of RAI. RJR Tobacco RJR Tobacco primarily conducts business in the highly competitive U.S. cigarette market, which has a few large manufacturers and many smaller participants. The U.S. cigarette market is a mature market in which overall consumer demand has declined since 1981 and is expected to continue to decline. Profitability of the U.S. cigarette industry and RJR Tobacco continues to be adversely impacted by decreases in consumption, increases in state excise taxes and governmental regulations and restrictions, such as marketing limitations, product standards and ingredients legislation. 26 Table of Contents The international rights to substantially all of RJR Tobaccos brands were sold in 1999 to JTI and no international rights were acquired in connection with the BW business combination. In addition, in connection with the BW business combination in 2004, RAI entered into a non competition agreement with BAT under which RAIs operating subsidiaries generally were prohibited, subject to certain exceptions, from manufacturing and marketing certain tobacco products outside the United States from the date of the BW business combination until July 2009. Expanding beyond the cigarette market as an innovative tobacco company, RJR Tobacco offers two types of smoke free tobacco, CAMEL Snus and CAMEL Dissolvables. CAMEL Snus, launched nationally in 2009, is pasteurized tobacco in a small pouch that provides convenient tobacco consumption. CAMEL Dissolvables include CAMEL Orbs, Sticks and Strips, all of which are made of finely milled tobacco and dissolve completely in the mouth. CAMEL Orbs were launched in three lead markets during the first quarter of 2009, and CAMEL Sticks and Strips were launched in those lead markets during the third quarter of 2009. RJR Tobaccos brand portfolio strategy is based upon three brand categories: growth, support and non support. The growth brands consist of a premium brand, CAMEL, and a value brand, PALL MALL. Although both of these brands are managed for long term market share and profit growth, CAMEL will continue to receive the most significant investment support. The support brands include four premium brands, WINSTON, KOOL, SALEM and CAPRI, and two value brands, DORAL and MISTY, all of which receive limited marketing support. The non support brands, consisting of all other brands, are managed to maximize near term profitability. The key objectives of the portfolio strategy are to ensure the long term market share growth of the growth brands while managing the support brands for long term sustainability and profitability. At present, RJR Tobaccos smoke free products are marketed under the CAMEL brand and focus on long term growth. Competition is based primarily on brand positioning, including price, product attributes and packaging, consumer loyalty, promotions, advertising and retail presence. Cigarette brands produced by the major manufacturers generally require competitive pricing, substantial marketing support, retail programs and other incentives to maintain or improve market position or to introduce a new brand style. RJR Tobacco is committed to building and maintaining a portfolio of profitable brands. RJR Tobaccos marketing programs are designed to strengthen brand image, build brand awareness and loyalty, and switch adult smokers of competing brands to RJR Tobacco brands. In addition to building strong brand equity, RJR Tobaccos marketing approach utilizes a retail pricing strategy, including discounting at retail, to defend certain brands shares of market against competitive pricing pressure. RJR Tobaccos competitive pricing methods may include list price changes, discounting programs, such as retail and wholesale buydowns, periodic price reductions, off invoice price reductions, dollar off promotions, free product promotions and consumer coupons. Retail buydowns refer to payments made to the retailer to reduce the price that consumers pay at retail. Consumer coupons generally are distributed by a variety of methods, including in, or on, the cigarette pack and by direct mail. Conwood Conwood offers a range of differentiated smokeless and other tobacco products to adult consumers. The moist snuff category is divided into premium and price value brands. The moist snuff category has developed many of the characteristics of the larger, cigarette market, including multiple pricing tiers with intense competition, focused marketing programs and significant product innovation. In contrast to the declining U.S. cigarette market, U.S. moist snuff volumes grew over 4% in 2009, driven by the accelerated growth of price value brands. Profit margins on moist snuff products are generally higher than on cigarette products. Moist snuffs growth is partially attributable to cigarette smokers switching from cigarettes to smokeless tobacco products or using both. Within the moist snuff category, premium brands have lost market share to price value brands, led by the growth of GRIZZLY, in recent years. However, during 2009, heavy promotion and competitive pricing of premium brands have slowed the growth of the price value brands. Conwood faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco categories. Similar to the cigarette market, competition is based primarily on brand positioning and price, as well as product attributes and packaging, consumer loyalty, promotions, advertising and retail presence. The parent company of RJR Tobaccos largest 27 Table of Contents competitor in the cigarette market, Philip Morris USA, Inc., completed its acquisition of Conwoods largest competitor, USSTC, in January 2009. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, referred to as GAAP, require estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the reported amounts in RAIs consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Some of these estimates require difficult, subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and as a result, actual results could differ from those estimates. Due to the estimation processes involved, the following summarized accounting policies and their application are considered to be critical to understanding the business operations, financial position and results of operations of RAI and its subsidiaries. For information related to these and other significant accounting policies, see Item 8, note 1 to consolidated financial statements. Litigation RAI discloses information concerning litigation for which an unfavorable outcome is more than remote. RAI and its subsidiaries record their legal expenses and other litigation costs and related administrative costs as selling, general and administrative expenses as those costs are incurred. RAI and its subsidiaries will record any loss related to litigation at such time as an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate is a range, the recorded loss will be the best estimate within the range. If no amount in the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount of the range will be recorded. As discussed in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements, RJR Tobacco, the Conwood companies and their affiliates, including RAI, and indemnitees, have been named in a number of tobacco related legal actions, proceedings or claims seeking damages in amounts ranging into the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. Unfavorable judgments have been returned in a number of tobacco related cases and state enforcement actions. As of January 29, 2010, RJR Tobacco had paid approximately $12 million since January 1, 2007, related to unfavorable judgments. RAI and its subsidiaries believe that they have valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against them and have valid defenses to all actions and they intend to defend all actions vigorously. RAIs management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees, including BW, or the loss of any particular claim concerning the use of smokeless tobacco against the Conwood companies, when viewed on an individual basis, is not probable or estimable. As of December 31, 2009, RJR Tobacco had $2 million accrued for an unfavorable judgment in the Whiteley v R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. case and $2 million accrued for non smoking and health litigation. In addition, as of December 31, 2009, RJR, including its subsidiary RJR Tobacco, had liabilities totaling $94 million that were recorded in connection with certain non smoking and health indemnification claims asserted by JTI relating to certain activities of Northern Brands and related litigation. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and it is possible that some of the tobacco related legal actions, proceedings or claims could ultimately be decided against RJR Tobacco, the Conwood companies or their affiliates, including RAI, and indemnitees. Any unfavorable outcome of such actions could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of RAI or its subsidiaries. For further discussion of the litigation and legal proceedings pending against RAI or its affiliates or indemnitees, see Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Settlement Agreements RJR Tobacco, Santa Fe and Lane are participants in the MSA, and RJR Tobacco is a participant in other state settlement agreements related to governmental health care cost recovery actions. Their obligations and the related expense charges under the State Settlement Agreements are subject to adjustments based upon, among other things, the volume of cigarettes sold by the operating subsidiaries, their relative market share and inflation. Since relative market share is based on cigarette shipments, the best estimate of the allocation of charges to RJR Tobacco under these agreements is recorded in cost of products sold as the products are shipped. Adjustments to these estimates are recorded in the period that the change becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. The 28 Table of Contents Conwood companies are not participants in the State Settlement Agreements. For more information related to historical and expected settlement expenses and payments under the State Settlement Agreements, see Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Health Care Cost Recovery Cases State Settlement Agreements and State Settlement Agreements Enforcement and Validity in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Intangible Assets Intangible assets include goodwill, trademarks and other intangibles. The determination of fair value involves considerable estimates and judgment. For goodwill, the determination of fair value of a reporting unit involves, among other things, RAIs market capitalization, and application of the income approach, which includes developing forecasts of future cash flows and determining an appropriate discount rate. If goodwill impairment is implied, the fair values of individual assets and liabilities, including unrecorded intangibles, must be determined. RAI believes it has based its goodwill impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions, and during the annual testing in the fourth quarter of 2009, the estimated fair value of each of RAIs reporting units was substantially in excess of its respective carrying value. Trademarks and other intangible assets with indefinite lives also are tested for impairment annually, in the fourth quarter. The aggregate fair value of RAIs operating units trademarks and other intangible assets was substantially in excess of their aggregate carrying value. However, the individual fair value of six indefinite lived trademarks was less than 15% in excess of their respective carrying values. The aggregate carrying value of these six trademarks was $561 million at December 31, 2009. The methodology used to determine the fair value of trademarks includes assumptions with inherent uncertainty, including projected sales volumes and related projected revenues, long term growth rates, royalty rates that a market participant might assume and judgments regarding the factors to develop an applied discount rate. The carrying value of these six trademarks are at risk of impairment if future projected revenues or long term growth rates are lower than those currently projected, or if factors used in the development of a discount rate result in the application of a higher discount rate. Goodwill, all trademarks and other intangible assets are tested more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The carrying value of these intangible assets could be impaired if a significant adverse change in the use, life, or brand strategy of the asset is determined, or if a significant adverse change in the legal and regulatory environment, business or competitive climate occurs that would adversely impact the asset. See Item 8, note 3 to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment charges. Fair Value Measurement RAI determines fair value of assets and liabilities using a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity, and the reporting entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, essentially an exit price. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: Level 1: inputs are quoted prices, unadjusted, in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2: inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. A Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3: inputs are unobservable and reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. 29 Table of Contents Investments Marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value, with related unrealized gains and losses deemed temporarily impaired reported, net of tax, as accumulated other comprehensive loss. All losses deemed to be other than temporarily impaired are recorded in earnings. As of December 31, 2009, RAI held investments primarily in money market funds, auction rate securities, a mortgage backed security and a marketable equity security. Certain money market funds are classified as short term investments due to the liquidity restrictions by the fund managers preventing immediate withdrawal. Adverse changes in financial markets caused the auction rate securities and the mortgage backed security to revalue lower than carrying value and become less liquid. The funds associated with the auction rate securities and the mortgage backed security will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs or a buyer is found. These investments are evaluated on a quarterly basis to determine if a credit loss has been incurred and the investment is other than temporarily impaired. For these investments, RAI uses assumptions about future cash flows and risk adjusted discount rates to determine fair value. To assess credit losses, RAI uses historical default rates, debt ratings, credit default swap spreads and recovery rates to determine if credit losses have been incurred. RAI has the intent and ability to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery in market value. Pension and Postretirement Benefits RAI and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor a number of non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering most of their employees, and also provide certain health and life insurance benefits for most of their retired employees and their dependents. These benefits are generally no longer provided to employees hired on or after January 1, 2004. For additional information relating to pension and postretirement benefits, see Item 8, note 17 to consolidated financial statements. Because pension and other postretirement obligations ultimately will be settled in future periods, the determination of annual expense and liabilities is subject to estimates and assumptions. RAI reviews these assumptions annually based on historic experience and expected future trends or coincidental with a major event and modifies them as needed. Demographic assumptions such as termination of employment, mortality or retirement are reviewed periodically as expectations change. Gains or losses are annual changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions. The minimum amortization of unrecognized gains or losses, is included in pension expense. Prior service costs, which are changes in benefit obligations due to plan amendments, are amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period for active employees, or average remaining life expectancies for inactive employees if most of the plan obligations are due to inactive employees. The minimum amortization of unrecognized gains or losses is also included in the postretirement benefit expense. Prior service costs, which are changes in benefit obligations due to plan amendments, are amortized on a straight line basis over the service to expected full eligibility age for active employees, or average remaining life expectancies for inactive employees if most of the plan obligations are due to inactive employees. Differences between actual results and actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods. In recent years, actual results have varied significantly from actuarial assumptions. In particular, pension and postretirement assets have decreased due to significant decreases in fair value. These changes, especially during 2008, have resulted in an increase in charges to other comprehensive loss and increased pension expense. These changes are expected to result in an increase in pension and postretirement expense in future years. The Pension Protection Act may require additional cash funding of the pension obligations in the future. 30 Table of Contents The most critical assumptions and their sensitivity to change are presented below: Assumed asset return and discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the benefit plans. A one percentage point change in assumed discount rate for the pension plans and other postretirement plans would have had the following effects: 1 Percentage Point 1 Percentage Point Increase Decrease Pension Postretirement Pension Postretirement Plans Plans Plans Plans Effect on 2009 net periodic benefit cost $ (15 ) $ (6 ) $ 32 $ 6 Effect on December 31, 2009, projected benefit obligation and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (489 ) (115 ) 586 136 A one percentage point change in assumed asset return would have had the following effects: 1 Percentage Point 1 Percentage Point Increase Decrease Pension Postretirement Pension Postretirement Plans Plans Plans Plans Effect on 2009 net periodic benefit cost $ (41 ) $ (3 ) $ 41 $ 3 Income Taxes Tax law requires certain items to be excluded or included in taxable income at different times than is required for book reporting purposes. These differences may be permanent or temporary in nature. RAI determines its annual effective income tax rate based on forecasted pre tax book income and forecasted permanent book and tax differences. The rate is established at the beginning of the year and is evaluated on a quarterly basis. Any changes to the forecasted information may cause the effective rate to be adjusted. Additional tax, interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in tax expense on a quarterly basis. To the extent that any book and tax differences are temporary in nature, that is, the book realization will occur in a different period than the tax realization, a deferred tax asset or liability is established. To the extent that a deferred tax asset is created, management evaluates RAIs ability to realize this asset. Management currently believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets recorded in RAIs consolidated balance sheet will be realized. To the extent a deferred tax liability is established, it is recorded, tracked and, once it becomes currently due and payable, paid to the taxing authorities. The financial statements reflect managements best estimate of RAIs current and deferred tax liabilities and assets. Future events, including but not limited to, additional resolutions with taxing authorities could have an impact on RAIs current estimate of tax liabilities, realization of tax assets and upon RAIs effective income tax rate. Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements For information relating to recently adopted accounting guidance, see Item 8, note 1 to consolidated financial statements. 31 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2009 Compared with 2008 For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2009 2008 % Change Net sales:(1) RJR Tobacco $ 7,334 $ 7,755 (5.4 )% Conwood 673 723 (6.9 )% All other 412 367 12.3 % Net sales 8,419 8,845 (4.8 )% Cost of products sold(1)(2) 4,485 4,863 (7.8 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,508 1,500 0.5 % Amortization expense 28 22 27.3 % Restructuring charge 56 90 (37.8 )% Trademark impairment charges 567 318 78.3 % Operating income: RJR Tobacco 1,487 1,805 (17.6 )% Conwood 276 232 19.0 % All other 112 104 7.7 % Corporate expense (100 ) (89 ) 12.4 % $ 1,775 $ 2,052 (13.5 )% (1) Excludes excise taxes of: 2009 2008 RJR Tobacco $ 3,532 $ 1,689 Conwood 124 20 All other 271 181 $ 3,927 $ 1,890 (2) See below for further information related to State Settlement Agreements and federal tobacco buyout expense included in cost of products sold. 32 Table of Contents RJR Tobacco Net Sales Domestic cigarette shipment volume, in billions of units for RJR Tobacco and the industry, were as follows(1): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2009 2008 % Change Growth brands: CAMEL excluding non filter 21.2 23.3 (9.2 )% PALL MALL 14.6 8.6 70.9 % 35.8 31.8 12.3 % Support brands 37.9 46.6 (18.7 )% Non support brands 8.0 11.0 (27.2 )% Total domestic 81.7 89.5 (8.7 )% Total premium 48.1 55.9 (13.9 )% Total value 33.5 33.5 (0.1 )% Premium/Total mix 59.0 % 62.5 % Industry(2): Premium 222.6 251.1 (11.3 )% Value 93.1 94.2 (1.2 )% Total domestic 315.7 345.3 (8.6 )% Premium/Total mix 70.5 % 72.7 % (1) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. Percentages are calculated on unrounded numbers. (2) Based on information from MSAi. All amounts reflect the current methodology. RJR Tobaccos net sales are dependent upon its cigarette shipment volume in a declining market, premium versus value brand mix and list pricing, offset by promotional spending, trade incentives and federal excise taxes. RJR Tobacco believes the federal excise tax increase, effective April 1, 2009, has had, and will continue to have, a significant and adverse impact on cigarette sales volume. RJR Tobacco also believes its consumers are more price sensitive than consumers of competing brands and, therefore, are more negatively affected by an increase in the federal excise tax and by the current adverse economic environment. RJR Tobaccos net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased $421 million, or 5.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2008, driven by $566 million attributable to lower cigarette volume. RJR Tobaccos decreases in net sales and cigarette shipment volume primarily reflect a continued decline in consumption, partially offset by the recent price increase resulting from the increase in federal excise tax. RJR Tobaccos total domestic cigarette shipment volume decreased 8.7% in 2009 compared with 2008. Industry cigarette shipment volume for 2009 was down 8.6% compared with 2008. RJR Tobaccos and industry cigarette shipment volume declines for 2009 are higher than prior years as a result of the increase in the federal excise tax. 33 Table of Contents The shares of RJR Tobaccos brands as a percentage of total share of U.S. retail cigarette sales according to data(1) from IRI/Capstone, were as follows(2)(3): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Share Point 2009 2008 Change Growth brands: CAMEL excluding non filter 7.5 % 7.7 % (0.1 ) PALL MALL 4.8 % 2.7 % 2.1 Total growth brands 12.3 % 10.4 % 1.9 Support brands 13.1 % 14.6 % (1.5 ) Non support brands 2.9 % 3.5 % (0.6 ) Total domestic 28.3 % 28.4 % (0.1 ) (1) Retail share of U.S. cigarette sales data is included in this document because it is used by RJR Tobacco primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants, and brands and market trends. You should not rely on the market share data reported by IRI/Capstone as being a precise measurement of actual market share because IRI/Capstone is not able to effectively track all volume. Moreover, you should be aware that in a product market experiencing overall declining consumption, a particular product can experience increasing market share relative to competing products, yet still be subject to declining consumption volumes. (2) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. (3) In 2009, at the request of RJR Tobacco, the IRI/Capstone model was revised to better reflect actual retail sales. All data reflects the new methodology. The retail share of market of CAMELs filtered styles decreased 0.1 share points in 2009 compared with 2008. CAMEL Crush has captured 0.7 share points as of December 31, 2009, as the success of this style continues to be a key driver in the growing menthol category. RJR Tobacco expanded the use of the capsule technology found in CAMEL Crush to CAMELs core menthol styles beginning in third quarter of 2009, giving adult smokers the choice between two levels of menthol. In the first quarter of 2010, RJR Tobacco will introduce new packaging for these styles to raise consumer awareness and trial and to strengthen growth in the menthol category. CAMEL Snus was expanded nationally in the first quarter of 2009, and as of December 31, 2009, gained market share of 0.3 percent on a cigarette equivalent basis that assumes a can of snus is equal to a pack of cigarettes. Two new styles of CAMEL Snus were launched in limited markets in the third quarter of 2009. CAMEL Orbs were launched in three lead markets during the first quarter of 2009, and CAMEL Sticks and Strips were launched in those lead markets in the third quarter of 2009. RJR Tobacco continues to gain insight on ways to improve the products and the packaging of the products. PALL MALLs market share increased 2.1 share points in 2009 compared with 2008. PALL MALLs growth is believed to be the result of adult consumers switching brands seeking greater value. PALL MALL, positioned as a product that offers a longer lasting cigarette at a value price, has retained a high percentage of adult smokers who try the brand. The combined share of market of RJR Tobaccos growth brands during 2009 showed improvement over 2008. Operating Income RJR Tobaccos operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased $318 million to $1,487 million from $1,805 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. A trademark impairment charge of $377 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2009 as the result of impairment testing to reflect the forecasted sales impact due to the increase in the federal excise tax. An additional trademark impairment charge of $114 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009 as the result of annual impairment testing of brand 34 Table of Contents trademarks. During 2008, RJR Tobacco recorded trademark impairment charges of $176 million. The impairment charges were based on the excess of each brands carrying value over its fair value using the present value of estimated future cash flows assuming a discount rate of 10.5%. RJR Tobaccos operating income was unfavorably impacted by lower cigarette volume, higher pension expense and higher legal expense. Higher pricing, lower promotional spending and productivity gains resulting from the 2008 restructuring partially offset the unfavorability. In December 2009, RJR Tobacco announced the elimination of approximately 400 full time production positions. These positions were selected from employees who volunteered to be considered for job elimination. The job eliminations are expected to be substantially completed by December 31, 2010. Under existing benefit plans, $48 million of severance related cash benefits and $8 million of non cash pension related benefits comprised a restructuring charge of $56 million. None of the cash portion of the charge was paid during 2009. The cash benefits are expected to be substantially paid by December 31, 2011. Cost savings related to the restructuring are expected to be $17 million in 2010 and increasing to approximately $30 million in 2011 and each year thereafter. RJR Tobaccos State Settlement Agreements and federal tobacco buyout expenses, included in cost of products sold, are detailed in the schedule below: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Settlements $ 2,490 $ 2,664 Federal tobacco quota buyout $ 231 $ 240 Expenses under the State Settlement Agreements are expected to be approximately $2.5 billion in 2010, subject to adjustment for changes in volume and other factors, and expense for the federal tobacco quota buyout is expected to be approximately $230 million to $260 million in 2010. For additional information, see Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Health Care Cost Recovery Cases State Settlement Agreements in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs of litigating and administering product liability claims, as well as other legal expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, RJR Tobaccos product liability defense costs were $123 million and $96 million, respectively. The increase in product liability defense costs in 2009 compared with 2008 is due primarily to the increase in Engle Progeny cases. For more information, see Individual Smoking and Health Cases Engle Progeny Cases in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Product liability cases generally include the following types of smoking and health related cases: Individual Smoking and Health; West Virginia IPIC; Engle Progeny; Broin II; Class Actions; and Health Care Cost Recovery Claims. Product liability defense costs include the following items: direct and indirect compensation, fees and related costs and expenses for internal legal and related administrative staff administering product liability claims; fees and cost reimbursements paid to outside attorneys; 35 Table of Contents direct and indirect payments to third party vendors for litigation support activities; expert witness costs and fees; and payments to fund legal defense costs for the now dissolved Council for Tobacco Research U.S.A. Numerous factors affect product liability defense costs. The most important factors are the number of cases pending and the number of cases in trial or in preparation for trial, that is, with active discovery and motions practice. See Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Overview in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements for detailed information regarding the number and type of cases pending, and Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Scheduled Trials in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements for detailed information regarding the number and nature of cases in trial and scheduled for trial through December 31, 2010. RJR Tobacco expects that the factors described above will continue to have the primary impact on its product liability defense costs in the future. Given the increased level of activity in RJR Tobaccos pending cases and possible new cases, including the increased number of cases in trial and scheduled for trial, particularly with respect to the Engle Progeny cases, RJR Tobaccos product liability defense costs have increased in 2009 compared with the most recent years. See Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Engle Progeny Cases and Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Class Action Suits Engle Case in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements for additional information. In addition, it is possible that adverse developments in the factors discussed above, as well as other circumstances beyond the control of RJR Tobacco, could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of RAI or its subsidiaries. Those other circumstances beyond the control of RJR Tobacco include the results of present and future trials and appeals, and the development of possible new theories of liability by plaintiffs and their counsel. Conwood Net Sales The moist snuff shipment volume, in millions of cans, for Conwood was as follows(1): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2009 2008 % Change KODIAK 47.8 51.0 (6.3 )% GRIZZLY 304.6 279.6 8.9 % Other 4.1 4.5 (9.9 )% Total moist snuff 356.5 335.2 6.4 % (1) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. Percentages are calculated on unrounded numbers. Conwoods net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, were $673 million compared with $723 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. GRIZZLY, Conwoods leading price value moist snuff brand, continues to grow moist snuff sales and was the leading moist snuff brand in the United States as of December 31, 2009. KODIAK, Conwoods leading premium moist snuff brand, reduced pricing at the end of the first quarter of 2009 to remain competitive. This price reduction and volume decline on KODIAK, and a delay in the price increase on GRIZZLY to cover the additional federal excise tax, were the primary drivers of the decrease in sales during 2009 compared with 2008. During 2009, in addition to aggressive promotional spending, pricing was significantly reduced by a competitor on its premium and certain price value brands. 36 Table of Contents The Conwood shares of the moist snuff category as a percentage of total share of U.S. shipments of moist snuff, according to distributor reported data(1) processed by MSAi, were as follows(2): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Share 2009 2008 Point Change KODIAK 3.8 % 4.0 % (0.2 ) GRIZZLY 25.3 % 23.2 % 2.0 Other 0.3 % 0.4 % (0.1 ) Total moist snuff 29.4 % 27.6 % 1.8 (1) Distributor shipments to retail share of U.S. moist snuff is included in this document because it is used by Conwood primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants, and brands and market trends. You should not rely on the market share data reported by distributors and processed by MSAi as being a precise measurement of actual market share because this distributor data set is not able to effectively track all volume. (2) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. Moist snuff has been the key driver to Conwoods overall growth and profitability within the U.S. smokeless tobacco market. Moist snuff accounted for approximately 71% of Conwoods revenue in 2009 and approximately 66% in 2008. While industry moist snuff volume grew over 4% in 2009, Conwoods moist snuff volume grew over 6% in 2009, attributable to its innovation, product development and brand building. Continuing with innovation and brand building, Conwood will feature embossed metal lids on KODIAK and GRIZZLY brands in 2010. GRIZZLY had a 25.3% share of moist snuff shipments in 2009, an increase of 2.0 share points from 2008, due in part to the success of new GRIZZLY styles. GRIZZLY launched mint and straight pouch styles in the first quarter of 2009 and GRIZZLY snuff pouches in the fourth quarter of 2009. Pouches, in the industry, have grown over 25% in 2009 and now account for nearly 8% of moist snuff sales. GRIZZLYs pouch styles generated approximately 60% of the pouch growth in the industry during 2009. Also being launched in the first quarter of 2010 is GRIZZLY 1900 Long Cut, a natural product with a traditional long cut. The shipment share of KODIAK declined 0.2 share points in 2009 compared with 2008 due to competitive promotional activity and the brands core markets being burdened by high tobacco taxes and the current economic recession. KODIAKs price reduction during the first quarter of 2009 aligned KODIAK with other premium brands, making it more competitive. Conwood launched CAMEL Dip, a premium moist snuff, in two styles, Wintergreen Wide Cut and Dark Milled, in lead markets during the second quarter of 2009. CAMEL Dip will be launched in ten additional markets in the first quarter of 2010. CAMEL Wintergreen pouches will be launched in the first quarter of 2010. Operating Income Conwoods operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased to $276 million from $232 million, primarily impacted by a trademark impairment charge of $76 million in 2009 compared with a trademark impairment charge of $142 million in 2008. Additionally, lower margins on KODIAK and higher promotional spending due to product introductions, tax increases and competitive activity were partially offset by increases in volume and pricing by GRIZZLY. The 2009 impairment charge was the result of impairment testing triggered by certain price reductions and the anticipated sales impact due to the increase in the federal excise tax effective April 1, 2009. This impairment occurred on several of Conwoods brands, including KODIAK, driven by the decrease in its list price to meet competition, as well as the federal excise tax impact on other brands. The impairment charge was based on the excess of each brands carrying value over its fair value using the present value of estimated future cash flows assuming a discount rate of 10.5%. 37 Table of Contents All Other All Other sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, were favorably impacted by the growth of Santa Fes NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand. Operating income for the 2009 year increased as a result of higher sales in 2009 as compared with 2008. RAI Consolidated Interest and debt expense was $251 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $24 million over the comparable prior year. This decrease was primarily due to lower effective interest rates in 2009 as compared with 2008 coupled with lower debt balances during 2009. Interest income was $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $41 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2008. This decrease was the result of investing at lower interest rates in 2009. Gain on termination of joint venture of $328 million in 2008 resulted from the termination of the Reynolds Gallaher International Sarl joint venture. See Item 8, note 5 to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the joint venture termination. Other expense net was $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $28 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2008. Impairments on investments deemed other than temporary of $35 million were expensed in 2008. Provision for income taxes was $572 million, or an effective rate of 37.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared with $790 million, or an effective rate of 37.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2008. The effective tax rate for 2009 was unfavorably impacted by the increases in unrecognized income tax benefits and increases in tax attributable to accumulated and undistributed foreign earnings. The 2008 effective rate was favorably impacted by a lower tax rate related to the gain on the termination of the Reynolds Gallaher International Sarl joint venture, but was offset by unfavorability related to tax reserves and U.S. taxes recorded on foreign earnings. The effective tax rates exceeded the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of state taxes and certain non deductible items, offset by the domestic production activities deduction of the American Jobs Creation Act, enacted on October 22, 2004. RAI expects its effective tax rate to be approximately 38% in 2010. 38 Table of Contents 2008 Compared with 2007 For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change Net sales:(1) RJR Tobacco $ 7,755 $ 8,022 (3.3 )% Conwood 723 670 7.9 % All other 367 331 10.9 % Net sales 8,845 9,023 (2.0 )% Cost of products sold(1)(2) 4,863 4,960 (2.0 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,500 1,687 (11.1 )% Amortization expense 22 23 (4.3 )% Restructuring charge 90 NM(3 ) Trademark impairment charges 318 65 NM(3 ) Operating income: RJR Tobacco 1,805 1,988 (9.2 )% Conwood 232 312 (25.6 )% All other 104 94 10.6 % Corporate expense (89 ) (106 ) (16.0 )% $ 2,052 $ 2,288 (10.3 )% (1) Excludes excise taxes of: 2008 2007 RJR Tobacco $ 1,689 $ 1,847 Conwood 20 18 All other 181 161 $ 1,890 $ 2,026 (2) See below for further information related to State Settlement Agreements and federal tobacco buyout expense included in cost of products sold. (3) Percentage change not meaningful. In 2008, RAI and RJR Tobacco announced changes in their organizational structures to streamline non core business processes and programs in order to allocate additional resources to strategic growth initiatives. The reorganizations resulted in the elimination of approximately 600 full time jobs, which were substantially completed by December 31, 2009. Under existing benefit plans, $83 million of severance related cash benefits and $7 million of non cash pension related benefits comprised a restructuring charge of $90 million. Of this charge, $81 million was recorded in the RJR Tobacco segment. Of the cash portion of the charge, $5 million was paid as of December 31, 2008. The cash benefits are expected to be substantially paid by December 31, 2010. 39 Table of Contents RJR Tobacco Net Sales Domestic cigarette shipment volume, in billions of units for RJR Tobacco and the industry, were as follows(1): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change Growth brands: CAMEL excluding non filter 23.3 24.2 (3.8 )% PALL MALL 8.6 7.1 20.8 % 31.8 31.3 1.7 % Support brands 46.6 52.0 (10.3 )% Non support brands 11.0 14.3 (23.3 )% Total domestic 89.5 97.6 (8.4 )% Total premium 55.9 60.9 (8.2 )% Total value 33.5 36.7 (8.7 )% Premium/Total mix 62.5 % 62.4 % Industry(2): Premium 251.1 259.9 (3.4 )% Value 94.2 97.3 (3.1 )% Total domestic 345.3 357.2 (3.3 )% Premium/Total mix 72.7 % 72.8 % (1) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. Percentages are calculated on unrounded numbers. (2) Based on information from MSAi. During 2008, RJR Tobacco selectively reduced the number of products sold by discontinuing a number of low margin and non core brands and styles to reduce complexity and improve efficiency. RJR Tobaccos net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008, decreased $267 million, or 3.3%, from the year ended December 31, 2007, driven by $339 million attributable to lower volume, partially offset by improved pricing, net of promotional spending. RJR Tobaccos decreases in net sales and shipment volume reflect intensified competitive activity in the first half of 2008, a decrease in consumption, wholesale inventory reductions, and the impact of RJR Tobaccos selective brand and style reduction. In addition, RJR Tobaccos consumers are believed to be more price sensitive than consumers of competing brands and, therefore, are more negatively affected by the current adverse economic pressures. RJR Tobaccos total domestic shipment volume decreased 8.4% in 2008 compared with 2007. Industry shipment volume for 2008 was down 3.3% compared with 2007. The shares of RJR Tobaccos brands as a percentage of total share of U.S. retail cigarette sales according to data(1) from IRI/Capstone, were as follows(2)(3): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Share Point 2008 2007 Change Growth brands: CAMEL excluding non filter 8.0 % 7.8 % 0.3 PALL MALL 2.6 % 2.1 % 0.5 Total growth brands 10.7 % 9.9 % 0.8 Support brands 13.8 % 14.7 % (0.9 ) Non support brands 3.6 % 4.4 % (0.8 ) Total domestic 28.1 % 29.0 % (1.0 ) 40 Table of Contents (1) Retail share of U.S. cigarette sales data is included in this document because it is used by RJR Tobacco primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants, and brands and market trends. You should not rely on the market share data reported by IRI/Capstone as being a precise measurement of actual market share because IRI/Capstone is not able to effectively track all volume. Moreover, you should be aware that in a product market experiencing overall declining consumption, a particular product can experience increasing market share relative to competing products, yet still be subject to declining consumption volumes. (2) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. (3) In 2009, at the request of RJR Tobacco, IRI/Capstone revised its sampling model to better reflect the current retail environment. Data provided herein reflects previously published data using IRI/Capstones historical methodology. The retail share of market of CAMELs filtered styles increased 0.3 share points in 2008 compared with 2007. During the first half of 2008, CAMEL launched updated packaging and smoother blends for its core styles. CAMEL also introduced CAMEL Crush in lead markets during the first quarter of 2008. CAMEL Crush was expanded nationally during the third quarter of 2008 and had a market share of 0.7 share points in the fourth quarter of 2008. CAMEL Snus expanded into a total of 17 markets in 2008. Additionally, in October 2008, RJR Tobacco introduced CAMEL Dissolvables that include CAMEL Orbs, Sticks and Strips. PALL MALLs market share increased 0.5 share points in 2008 compared with 2007. PALL MALLs growth is believed to be the result of the brands position as a product that offers a longer lasting cigarette at a value price. PALL MALL introduced more stylish, round corner packs in the second quarter of 2008. The combined share of market of RJR Tobaccos growth brands during 2008 showed improvement over 2007. However, the decline in share of support and non support brands more than offset the gains on the growth brands. Operating Income RJR Tobaccos operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008, decreased $183 million to $1,805 million from $1,988 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition to a restructuring charge of $81 million in the second half of 2008, the reclassification of KOOL to a support brand from a growth brand in the third quarter of 2008 triggered a non cash trademark impairment of $173 million. An additional impairment charge of $3 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2008 as the result of annual impairment testing of brand trademarks. In 2007, RJR Tobacco recorded a trademark impairment charge of $33 million. The trademark impairment charge and restructuring charge were partially offset by higher pricing and improvements in productivity. RJR Tobaccos operating income was also negatively impacted by decreases in shipment volume due to intensified competitive activity in the first half of 2008, a decrease in consumption, wholesale inventory reductions, as well as RJR Tobaccos selective style and brand reduction. RJR Tobaccos State Settlement Agreements and federal tobacco buyout expenses, included in cost of products sold, are detailed in the schedule below: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 2007 Settlements $ 2,664 $ 2,791 Federal tobacco quota buyout $ 240 $ 247 Selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs of litigating and administering product liability claims, as well as other legal expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, RJR Tobaccos product liability defense costs were $96 million and $88 million, respectively. 41 Table of Contents Conwood Net Sales The moist snuff shipment volume, in millions of cans, for Conwood was as follows(1): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2008 2007 % Change KODIAK 51.0 53.2 (4.2 )% GRIZZLY 279.6 237.0 18.0 % Other 4.5 5.4 (16.1 )% Total moist snuff 335.2 295.6 13.4 % (1) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. Percentages are calculated on unrounded numbers. Conwoods net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008, were $723 million compared with $670 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. Moist snuff sales generated the increase over the prior year period, led by GRIZZLY. The Conwood shares of the moist snuff category as a percentage of total share of U.S. shipments of moist snuff, according to distributor reported data(1) processed by MSAi, were as follows(2): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Share 2008 2007 Point Change KODIAK 4.0 % 4.4 % (0.4 ) GRIZZLY 23.2 % 21.1 % 2.2 Other 0.4 % 0.5 % (0.1 ) Total moist snuff 27.6 % 26.0 % 1.7 (1) Distributor shipments to retail share of U.S. moist snuff is included in this document because it is used by Conwood primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants, and brands and market trends. You should not rely on the market share data reported by distributors and processed by MSAi as being a precise measurement of actual market share because this distributor data set is not able to effectively track all volume. (2) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. Moist snuff accounted for approximately 66% of Conwoods revenue in 2008 and approximately 60% in 2007. Conwoods key brands include KODIAK in the premium brand category and GRIZZLY in the price value brand category. Conwoods U.S. moist snuff market share was 27.6% in 2008 and 26.0% in 2007 based on distributor reported data processed by MSAi, for distributor shipments to retail. Although moist snuff volume grew over 7% in 2008, Conwoods moist snuff volume grew over 13% in 2008, attributable to its innovation, product development and brand building. GRIZZLY had a 23.2% share of moist snuff shipments in 2008, an increase of 2.2 share points from 2007, despite further narrowing of the price gap between premium brands and value brands, such as GRIZZLY. In 2008, Conwood expanded nationally the launch of two new GRIZZLY styles, GRIZZLY Wintergreen Pouches and GRIZZLY Snuff, to build on the brands momentum and aid in its share growth. The shipment share of KODIAK declined 0.4 share points in 2008 compared with 2007 due to competitive promotional activity and the brands core markets being burdened by high tobacco taxes and the current economic recession. 42 Table of Contents Operating Income Conwoods operating income for the year ended December 31, 2008, decreased to $232 million from $312 million for 2007. This change is due to increased price value volume and higher pricing offset primarily by trademark impairment. The annual impairment testing of trademarks in the fourth quarter of 2008 resulted in a charge of $142 million compared with $32 million in 2007. The 2008 impairment occurred primarily on KODIAK, which reflected the demand shift from premium to price value brands. All Other All Other sales for the year ended December 31, 2008, were favorably impacted by the growth of Santa Fes NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand. Operating income for the 2008 year increased as a result of lower marketing expenses in 2008 as compared with 2007. RAI Consolidated Gain on termination of joint venture of $328 million in 2008 resulted from the termination of the Reynolds Gallaher International Sarl joint venture. See Item 8, note 5 to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the joint venture termination. Interest and debt expense was $275 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $63 million over the comparable prior year. This decrease was primarily due to lower effective interest rates and lower outstanding debt in 2008 as compared with 2007. Interest income was $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of $74 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. This decrease was the result of investing available cash at lower interest rates in 2008. Other expense net was expense of $37 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, an increase of $26 million compared with the year ended December 31, 2007. Impairments on investments deemed other than temporary of $35 million were expensed in 2008. Provision for income taxes was $790 million, or an effective rate of 37.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2008, compared with $766 million, or an effective rate of 37.0%, for the year ended December 31, 2007. The 2008 provision was favorably impacted by a lower tax rate related to the gain on the termination of the Reynolds Gallaher International Sarl joint venture, but was offset by unfavorability related to tax reserves and U.S. taxes recorded on foreign earnings. The effective tax rates exceeded the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of state taxes and certain non deductible items, offset by the domestic production activities deduction of the American Jobs Creation Act, enacted on October 22, 2004. Liquidity and Financial Condition Liquidity At present, the principal sources of liquidity for RAIs operating subsidiaries businesses and operating needs are internally generated funds from their operations and intercompany loans and advances, mainly from RAI and RJR. The principal capital resources and sources of liquidity for RAI and RJR, in turn, are proceeds from issuances of debt securities by RAI and RJR and the RAI credit facility described below under Borrowing Arrangements. Cash flows from operating activities are believed to be sufficient for the foreseeable future to enable the operating subsidiaries to meet their obligations under the State Settlement Agreements, to fund their capital expenditures and to make payments to RAI and RJR that, when combined with RAIs and RJRs cash balances, will enable RAI and RJR to make their required debt service payments, and enable RAI to pay dividends to its shareholders. The negative impact, if any, on the sources of liquidity that could result from a decrease in demand for products due to short term inventory adjustments by wholesale and retail distributors, changes in competitive pricing, accelerated declines in consumption, particularly from increases in regulation or excise taxes, or adverse impacts from financial markets, cannot be predicted. RAI cannot predict its cash requirements or those of its subsidiaries 43 Table of Contents related to any future settlements or judgments, including cash required to be held in escrow or to bond any appeals, if necessary, and RAI makes no assurance that it or its subsidiaries will be able to meet all of those requirements. RAI evaluated the liquidity of key suppliers and significant customers throughout 2009. Where there were liquidity concerns identified with key suppliers, contingency plans were developed. To date, no business interruptions have occurred caused by key supplier liquidity. No liquidity issues were identified regarding significant customers. As of December 31, 2009, RAI held investments primarily in money market funds, auction rate securities, a mortgage backed security and a marketable equity security. Certain money market funds are classified as short term investments due to liquidity restrictions by the fund managers preventing immediate withdrawal. Given such restrictions, these funds will not be available until the underlying investments mature or are sold. Adverse changes in financial markets caused the auction rate securities and the mortgage backed security to revalue lower than carrying value and become less liquid. The auction rate securities and the mortgage backed security will not become liquid until a successful auction occurs or a buyer is found. RAI intends, and has the ability, to hold these money market funds, auction rate securities and the mortgage backed security for a period of time sufficient to allow for sale, redemption or anticipated recovery in fair value. At December 31, 2009, RAI considered the mortgage backed security and the auction rate securities to be temporarily impaired. Contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009 were as follows: Payments Due by Period Less than 1 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Total Year 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Long term notes, exclusive of interest(1) $ 4,210 $ 300 $ 850 $ 685 $ 2,375 Interest payments related to long term notes(1) 1,902 233 412 306 951 Operating leases(2) 69 17 29 20 3 Non qualified pension obligations(3) 88 9 18 17 44 Postretirement benefit obligations(3) 718 68 144 147 359 Qualified pension funding(3) 300 300 Purchase obligations(4) 779 339 178 189 73 Other noncurrent liabilities(5) 95 N/A 64 10 21 State Settlement Agreements obligations(6) 13,300 2,500 5,400 5,400 Gross unrecognized tax benefit(7) 94 Federal tobacco buyout obligations(8) 1,360 260 550 550 Total cash obligations $ 22,915 $ 4,026 $ 7,645 $ 7,324 $ 3,826 (1) For more information about RAIs and RJRs long term notes, see Item 8, note 12 to consolidated financial statements. (2) Operating lease obligations represent estimated lease payments primarily related to office space, automobiles, warehouse space and computer equipment. See Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements for additional information. (3) For more information about RAIs pension plans and postretirement benefits, see Item 8, note 17 to consolidated financial statements. Non qualified pension and postretirement benefit obligations captioned under Thereafter include obligations during the next five years only. These obligations are not reasonably estimable beyond ten years. Qualified pension plan funding is based on the Pension Protection Act and tax deductibility and is not reasonably estimable beyond one year. (4) Purchase obligations primarily include commitments to acquire tobacco leaf. Purchase orders for the purchase of other raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table. RAIs operating subsidiaries are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders typically represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. For purposes 44 Table of Contents of this table, contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined by RAIs operating subsidiaries as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase orders of RAIs operating subsidiaries are based on current demand expectations and are fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons. RAIs operating subsidiaries do not have significant non cancelable agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods or services specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements. RAIs operating subsidiaries also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts were generally not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for the cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Other noncurrent liabilities include primarily restructuring and bonus compensation. Certain other noncurrent liabilities are excluded from the table above, including RJRs liabilities recorded in 1999 related to certain indemnification claims, for which timing of payments are not estimable. For more information about RJRs indemnification obligations, see Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. (6) State Settlement Agreements obligation amounts in the aggregate beyond five years are not meaningful as these are obligations into perpetuity. For more information about the State Settlement Agreements, see Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. (7) For more information on gross unrecognized tax benefits, see Item 8, note 10 to consolidated financial statements. Due to inherent uncertainties regarding the timing of payment of these amounts, RAI cannot reasonably estimate the payment period. (8) For more information about the tobacco buyout legislation, see Governmental Activity below and Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Commitments as of December 31, 2009 were as follows: Commitment Expiration Period Less than Total 1 Year Standby letters of credit backed by revolving credit facility $ 15 $ 15 Total commitments $ 15 $ 15 Cash Flows 2009 Compared with 2008 Net cash flows from operating activities were $1,454 million in 2009, compared with $1,315 million in 2008. This change was driven by the partial retention of the 2009 MSA payment and lower taxes paid, partially offset by higher pension payments, higher bonds posted and lower interest received in 2009. Net cash flows used in investing activities was $123 million in 2009, compared with net cash flows from investing activities of $278 million for the prior year. This change was primarily driven by lower proceeds from short term investments as well as higher capital expenditures and an acquisition in 2009 compared with the 2008 proceeds from the termination of the joint venture. Net cash flows used in financing activities were $1,192 million in 2009, compared with $1,206 million in 2008. Lower common stock purchases in 2009 were nearly offset by long term debt repaid in 2009. 2008 Compared with 2007 Net cash flows from operating activities were $1,315 million in 2008, compared with $1,331 million in 2007. This change was driven primarily by higher State Settlement Agreement and tax payments, partially offset by lower pension funding in 2008. Net cash flows from investing activities were $278 million in 2008, compared with $763 million for the prior year. This change was primarily driven by higher short term investing net proceeds in 2007 that more than offset the proceeds received in 2008 as a result of the termination of the joint venture. 45 Table of Contents Net cash flows used in financing activities were $1,206 million in 2008, compared with $1,312 million in 2007. This change was due to prior year repayment of long term debt, offset by higher stock repurchases and higher dividends per share in 2008. Borrowing Arrangements As of December 31, 2009, RAIs total consolidated debt consisted of RAI notes in the aggregate principal amount of $4.1 billion, with maturity dates ranging from 2010 to 2037, and RJR notes in the aggregate principal amount of $118 million, with maturity dates ranging from 2012 to 2015. See Item 8, note 12 to consolidated financial statements for more information on these notes. RAI and RJR use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on a portion of their debt obligations. On December 31, 2008, interest rate swaps existed on $1.6 billion of fixed rate notes. When entered into, these swaps were designated as hedges of underlying exposures. On January 6, 2009, RAI and RJR entered into offsetting interest rate swap agreements in the notional amount of $1.5 billion with maturity dates ranging from June 1, 2012 to June 15, 2017. These swaps were entered into with the same financial institution that holds a notional amount of $1.5 billion of current swaps and have a technical right of offset. The future cash flows, established as a result of entering into the January 6, 2009, swaps, total $321 million, and will be amortized and effectively reduce net interest costs over the remaining life of the notes. Concurrent with entering the swap agreements on January 6, 2009, RAI de designated the current swaps as fair value hedges. On January 7, 2009, RAI and RJR terminated an interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of $100 million with a maturity date of June 1, 2012. The resulting gain of approximately $12 million will be amortized to effectively reduce interest expense over the remaining life of the notes. As a result of these actions, RAI and RJR have effectively converted $1.6 billion of fixed rate notes swapped to a variable rate of interest, to a fixed rate of interest of approximately 4.0%. At their option, RAI and RJR, as applicable, may redeem any or all of their outstanding fixed rate notes, in whole or in part at any time, subject to the payment of a make whole premium. RAIs floating rate notes are redeemable at par on any interest payment date after December 15, 2008. Effective July 3, 2009, RAI entered into a Second Amendment to Credit Agreement, referred to as the Second Amendment, amending RAIs credit facility. The Second Amendment amends the credit facility by, among other things: terminating the revolving loan commitment of Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., referred to as LCPI, which filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code on October 5, 2008, and thereby reducing the total revolving loan commitment under the credit facility from $550 million to $498 million; amending the definition of Lender Default and certain related definitions; granting RAI the right under certain circumstances to terminate the revolving loan commitment of a Defaulting Lender, as defined in the credit facility, if RAI is unable to replace such Defaulting Lender; and otherwise clarifying the rights and responsibilities of the parties to the credit facility upon the occurrence of a Lender Default. Effective with the Second Amendment, RAIs credit facility of $498 million may be increased up to $848 million at the discretion of the lenders upon the request of RAI. 46 Table of Contents Lenders and their respective commitments in the credit facility, which are several, not joint, commitments, are listed below: Lender Commitment JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. $ 52.89 Citibank N.A. 52.89 Morgan Stanley Bank 52.00 Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd. 52.00 General Electric Capital Corporation 52.00 AG First Farm Credit Bank 52.00 Goldman Sachs Bank USA 35.00 Wachovia Bank, National Association 35.00 The Bank of Nova Scotia 35.00 The Bank of New York 35.00 Farm Credit Services of Minnesota Valley, PCA DBA FCS Commercial Finance Group 20.00 City National Bank of New Jersey 14.22 Farm Credit Bank of Texas 10.00 $ 498.00 At December 31, 2009, RAI had $15 million in letters of credit outstanding under the credit facility. At such date, no borrowings were outstanding, and the remaining $483 million of the credit facility was available for borrowing. Certain of RAIs subsidiaries, including the Guarantors, have guaranteed RAIs obligations under the credit facility and under RAIs outstanding senior notes, referred to as the Notes. The collateral for the credit facility, Notes and related guarantees (which was released during 2008) will be reinstated if RAIs corporate credit rating issued by each of SP and Moodys is lowered to at least one level below the lowest rating level established as investment grade, or if RAIs corporate credit rating issued by either SP or Moodys is lowered to at least two levels below the lowest rating level established as investment grade. Concerns about, or lowering of, RAIs ratings by SP or Moodys could have an adverse impact on RAIs ability to access the debt markets and could increase borrowing costs. However, given the cash balances and operating performance of RAI and its subsidiaries, RAIs management believes that such concerns about, or lowering of, such ratings would not have a material adverse impact on RAIs cash flows. RAI, RJR and their affiliates were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions imposed by their indebtedness at December 31, 2009. Dividends On February 2, 2010, RAIs board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.90 per common share. The dividend will be paid on April 1, 2010, to shareholders of record as of March 10, 2010. On an annualized basis, the dividend rate is $3.60 per common share. The current dividend reflects RAIs policy of paying dividends to the holders of RAI common stock in an aggregate amount that is approximately 75% of RAIs annual consolidated net income. Stock Repurchases On April 29, 2008, RAIs board of directors authorized RAIs repurchase, prior to April 30, 2009, of up to $350 million of outstanding shares of RAI common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions. Due to RAIs incorporation in North Carolina, which does not recognize treasury shares, the shares repurchased are cancelled at the time of repurchase. RAI had repurchased and cancelled 3,817,095 shares of RAI common stock for 47 Table of Contents $207 million under the above share repurchase program during 2008. RAI did not repurchase any shares of RAI common stock under this program in 2009. Additionally during 2009, at a cost of $5 million, RAI purchased 154,441 shares that were forfeited with respect to tax liabilities associated with restricted stock vesting under its LTIP. Capital Expenditures RAIs operating subsidiaries recorded cash capital expenditures of $141 million, $113 million and $142 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Of the 2009 amount, $55 million related to RJR Tobacco and $75 million related to Conwood. RJR Tobacco plans to spend $50 million to $60 million for capital expenditures during 2010, primarily on non discretionary business requirements, and Conwood plans to spend $165 million to $175 million in 2010, primarily on non discretionary capacity projects for the Memphis, Tennessee and Clarksville, Tennessee facilities. Capital expenditures are funded primarily by cash flows from operations. RAIs operating subsidiaries capital expenditure programs are expected to continue at a level sufficient to support their strategic and operating needs. There were no material long term commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2009. Retirement Benefits Due primarily to the adverse changes in the financial markets, RAIs pension assets have been negatively impacted. In 2008, the overall rate of return on the investments for the pension assets was negative approximately 30.1%. RAI assessed the asset allocation and investment strategy and will phase in appropriate changes to balance funded status, interest rate risk and asset returns. Once fully implemented, these changes will reduce the pension funds exposure to equities and increase exposure to fixed income and alternatives. As a result of changes to the asset allocation and investment strategy, RAI lowered the expected long term return on pension assets, referred to as the ELTRA, to 8.25%, in 2009, from 8.74%. The ELTRA, asset allocation, current asset performance and the discount rate may impact the funded status of RAIs pension plans. As a result, to improve the funded status, RAI contributed $295 million to the pension assets in 2009 and pension expense increased approximately $187 million in 2009 to $125 million. In 2009, the overall rate of return on the investments for the pension assets was approximately 24.8%. In 2010, RAI plans to contribute $309 million to the pension assets, of which $300 million was contributed in January 2010, and the pension expense is expected to be $115 million. Income Taxes At December 31, 2009, RAI had a net deferred tax asset of $515 million. RAI has determined that no valuation allowance is required to be recorded against this deferred tax asset as RAI believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will be realized. This determination is due largely to RAIs historical and projected reporting pretax earnings and taxable income. Litigation and Settlements As discussed in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements, RJR Tobacco, the Conwood companies and their affiliates, including RAI, and indemnitees, including BW, have been named in a number of tobacco related legal actions, proceedings or claims seeking damages in amounts ranging into the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. Unfavorable judgments have been returned in a number of tobacco related cases and state enforcement actions. As of January 29, 2010, RJR Tobacco has paid approximately $12 million since January 1, 2007, related to unfavorable judgments. RJR, including its subsidiary RJR Tobacco, have liabilities totaling $94 million that were recorded in connection with certain indemnification claims, not related to smoking and health, asserted by JTI against RJR and RJR Tobacco, relating to the activities of Northern Brands and related litigation. RAIs management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees, or the loss of any particular claim concerning the use of smokeless tobacco against the Conwood companies, when viewed on an individual basis, is not probable. RAI and its subsidiaries believe that they have valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against them and have valid defenses to all actions and intend to defend all actions vigorously. Nonetheless, the possibility of material losses related to 48 Table of Contents tobacco litigation is more than remote. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and generally it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against RJR Tobacco, the Conwood companies or their affiliates or indemnitees, or to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss. Moreover, notwithstanding the quality of defenses available to it and its affiliates in tobacco related litigation matters, it is possible that RAIs consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of certain pending or future litigation matters. In November 1998, RJR Tobacco, BW and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers entered into the MSA with attorneys general representing most U.S. states, territories and possessions. As described in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements, the State Settlement Agreements impose a perpetual stream of future payment obligations on RJR Tobacco and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers and place significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell cigarettes in the future. For more information related to historical and expected settlement expenses and payments under the State Settlement Agreements, see Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Health Care Cost Recovery Cases State Settlement Agreements in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. The State Settlement Agreements have materially adversely affected RJR Tobaccos shipment volumes. RAI believes that these settlement obligations may materially adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of RAI and RJR Tobacco in future periods. The degree of the adverse impact will depend, among other things, on the rate of decline in U.S. cigarette sales in the premium and value categories, RJR Tobaccos share of the domestic premium and value cigarette categories, and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to the State Settlement Agreements. RJR Tobacco and certain of the other participating manufacturers under the State Settlement Agreements are currently involved in litigation with the settling states with respect to the availability for certain market years of a downward adjustment to the annual State Settlement Agreements payment obligation, known as the Non Participating Manufacturer Adjustment. Pending the resolution of these disputes, RJR Tobacco and certain of the other participating manufacturers have placed the disputed portions of their 2006, 2007 and 2008 annual payments into the MSA disputed funds account. In February 2009, approximately $431 million was released, without waiving claim, to the settling states. Accordingly, RJR Tobacco had approximately $1.2 billion deposited in the MSA disputed funds account as of December 31, 2009. In April 2009, RJR Tobacco retained approximately $406.5 million of its 2009 MSA payment to reflect its share of the 2006 NPM Adjustment as calculated by the independent auditor. For more information related to this litigation, see Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry State Settlement Agreements Enforcement and Validity and Other NPM Adjustment Claims in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Governmental Activity The marketing, sale, taxation and use of tobacco products have been subject to substantial regulation by government and health officials for many years. Various state governments have adopted or are considering, among other things, legislation and regulations that would: significantly increase their taxes on tobacco products; restrict displays, advertising and sampling of tobacco products; establish fire standards compliance for cigarettes; raise the minimum age to possess or purchase tobacco products; restrict or ban the use of certain flavorings, including menthol, in tobacco products, or the use of certain flavor descriptors in the marketing of tobacco products; require the disclosure of ingredients used in the manufacture of tobacco products; require the disclosure of nicotine yield information for cigarettes; impose restrictions on smoking in public and private areas; and restrict the sale of tobacco products directly to consumers or other unlicensed recipients, including over the Internet. 49 Table of Contents In addition, as discussed in greater detail below, during 2009, the U.S. Congress adopted legislation increasing the federal excise tax on cigarettes and other tobacco products, and granting the FDA broad authority over the manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco products. During 2010, the U.S. Congress also may consider legislation regarding: regulation of environmental tobacco smoke; implementation of a national fire standards compliance for cigarettes; regulation of the retail sale of tobacco products over the Internet and in other non face to face retail transactions, such as by mail order and telephone; and banning of the delivery of tobacco products by the U.S. Postal Service. Together with manufacturers price increases in recent years and substantial increases in state and federal taxes on tobacco products, these developments have had and will likely continue to have an adverse effect on the sale of tobacco products. Cigarettes and other tobacco products are subject to substantial taxes in the United States. On February 4, 2009, President Obama signed into law, effective April 1, 2009, an increase of $0.62 in the excise tax per pack of cigarettes, and significant tax increases on other tobacco products, to fund expansion of the SCHIP. Under these federal tax increases: the federal excise tax per pack of 20 cigarettes increased to $1.01; the federal excise tax rate for chewing tobacco increased $0.3083 per pound to $0.5033 per pound, and for snuff increased $0.925 per pound to $1.51 per pound; the federal excise tax on small cigars, defined as those weighing three pounds or less per thousand, increased $48.502 per thousand to $50.33 per thousand; and the federal excise tax rate for roll your own tobacco increased from $1.097 per pound to $24.78 per pound. All states and the District of Columbia currently impose cigarette excise taxes at levels ranging from $0.07 per pack in South Carolina to $3.46 per pack in Rhode Island. As of December 31, 2009, the weighted average state cigarette excise tax per pack, calculated on a 12 month rolling average basis, was approximately $1.16, compared with the 12 month rolling average of $1.00 as of December 31, 2008. During 2009, 14 states and the District of Columbia passed cigarette excise tax increases, and a number of other states are considering an increase in their cigarette excise taxes for 2010. Certain city and county governments, such as New York and Chicago, also impose substantial excise taxes on cigarettes sold in those jurisdictions. Cigars generally are taxed by states on an ad valorem basis, ranging from 5% in South Carolina to 80% in Rhode Island. Other states have unit based tax schemes for cigars or tax little cigars the same as cigarettes. Forty nine states and the District of Columbia also subject smokeless tobacco to excise taxes, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the singular exception, may enact such a tax during its 2010 legislative session. As of December 31, 2009, 32 states taxed moist snuff, and 44 states taxed chewing tobacco, on an ad valorem basis at rates that range from 5% in South Carolina to 100% in Wisconsin. Other states have a unit tax or a weight based tax. During 2009, four states and the District of Columbia enacted legislation changing from an ad valorem to a weight based taxation system on moist snuff. In addition, Oregon also passed a weight based tax on moist snuff, which took effect on January 1, 2010, and Wisconsin switched the method of taxing moist snuff from a weight based tax back to an ad valorem tax. Legislation to convert from an ad valorem to a weight based tax is expected to be introduced in several states in 2010. In total, during 2009, 17 states passed tax increases on other tobacco products, and a number of other states are considering an increase in their taxes on other tobacco products for 2010. 50 Table of Contents On July 16, 2009, Oregon enacted a statute including a requirement that smokeless tobacco manufacturers who are not signatories to the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, referred to as the STMSA, either certify compliance with certain requirements imposed by the STMSA or place into escrow $0.40 for every unit of smokeless tobacco sold in the state as security against certain types of claims that might be brought by Oregon or other Releasing Parties under the STMSA. On September 4, 2009, Conwood Company, LLC, among others, brought suit in Circuit Court, Madison County, Oregon (Conwood Company, LLC v. Kroger) to enjoin the enforcement of this Oregon statute contending the statute violates the constitutions of Oregon and the United States. For further information regarding this case, see Item 8, note 14, to consolidated financial statements. Oregon also is considering legislation that would require smokeless tobacco manufacturers to join the STMSA and make payments thereunder or place into escrow an amount equivalent to what a manufacturer would have paid had it joined the STMSA. The legislation also would change the tax on chewing tobacco from ad valorem to a weight based tax of $1.78 per ounce. In 1964, the Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service concluded that cigarette smoking was a health hazard of sufficient importance to warrant appropriate remedial action. Since 1966, federal law has required a warning statement on cigarette packaging, and cigarette advertising in other media also is required to contain a warning statement. Since 1971, television and radio advertising of cigarettes has been prohibited in the United States. During the past four decades, various laws affecting the cigarette industry have been enacted. In 1984, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Smoking Education Act. Among other things, this act: established an interagency committee on smoking and health that is charged with carrying out a program to inform the public of any dangers to human health presented by cigarette smoking; required a series of four health warnings to be printed on cigarette packages and advertising on a rotating basis; increased type size and area of the warning required in cigarette advertisements; and required that cigarette manufacturers provide annually, on a confidential basis, a list of ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes to the Secretary of Health and Human Services. The warnings currently required on cigarette packages and advertisements are: SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease, Emphysema, And May Complicate Pregnancy; SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Quitting Smoking Now Greatly Reduces Serious Risks to Your Health; SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Smoking By Pregnant Women May Result in Fetal Injury, Premature Birth, And Low Birth Weight; and SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon Monoxide. Since the initial report in 1964, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, now the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Surgeon General have issued a number of other reports which purport to find the nicotine in cigarettes addictive and to link cigarette smoking and exposure to cigarette smoke with certain health hazards, including various types of cancer, coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive lung disease. These reports have recommended various governmental measures to reduce the incidence of smoking. In 1992, the federal Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Act was signed into law. This act required states to adopt a minimum age of 18 for purchase of tobacco products and to establish a system to monitor, report and reduce the illegal sale of tobacco products to minors in order to continue receiving federal funding for mental health and drug abuse programs. In 1996, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced regulations implementing this legislation. And in 2006, the Surgeon General released a report entitled The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke. Among its conclusions, the report found the following: exposure of adults to secondhand smoke causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer, exposure of children to secondhand smoke 51 Table of Contents results in an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome, acute respiratory infections, ear problems and more severe asthma; and that there is no risk free level of exposure to secondhand smoke. In 1986, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986, which, among other things, required health warning notices on smokeless tobacco packages and advertising and prohibited the advertising of smokeless tobacco products on any medium of electronic communications subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission. The warnings currently required on smokeless tobacco packages and advertising, which appear on a rotating basis, are: WARNING: THIS PRODUCT MAY CAUSE MOUTH CANCER; WARNING: THIS PRODUCT MAY CAUSE GUM DISEASE AND TOOTH LOSS; and WARNING: THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO CIGARETTES. In 2000, the seven largest U.S. cigar companies, including Lane, entered into agreements with the FTC, to clearly and conspicuously display on virtually every cigar package and advertisement one of the following warnings, which appear on a rotating basis: SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Cigar Smoking Can Cause Cancers Of The Mouth And Throat, Even If You Do Not Inhale; SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Cigar Smoking Can Cause Lung Cancer And Heart Disease; SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Tobacco Use Increases The Risk Of Infertility, Stillbirth And Low Birth Weight; SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Cigars Are Not A Safe Alternative To Cigarettes; and SURGEON GENERAL WARNING: Tobacco Smoke Increases The Risk Of Lung Cancer And Heart Disease, Even In Nonsmokers. On June 22, 2009, President Obama signed into law the FDA Tobacco Act, which grants the FDA broad authority over the manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco products. The following provisions of the FDA Tobacco Act took effect upon passage: no charitable distribution of tobacco products; prohibitions on statements that would lead consumers to believe that a tobacco product is approved, endorsed, or deemed safe by the FDA; pre market approval by the FDA for claims made with respect to reduced risk or reduced exposure products; and prohibition on the marketing of tobacco products in conjunction with any other class of product regulated by the FDA. In addition, as of September 20, 2009, tobacco manufacturers are banned from selling cigarettes with characterizing flavors (other than menthol, which under the FDA Tobacco Act is specifically exempt as a characterizing flavor, but the impact of which on public health will be studied as discussed below). Over the course of the next three years, various provisions under the FDA Tobacco Act and regulations to be issued under the FDA Tobacco Act will become effective and will: require tobacco manufacturers to register their manufacturing facilities and list of tobacco products; require manufacturers to produce health related documents generated from and after June 22, 2009; require manufacturers to report ingredients and harmful constituents; 52 Table of Contents require different and larger warnings on packaging and advertising for cigarettes and smokeless tobacco products; ban the use of descriptors on tobacco products, such as low tar and light; require manufacturers to obtain FDA clearance for cigarette and smokeless tobacco products commercially launched or to be launched after February 15, 2007; require manufacturers to test ingredients and constituents identified by FDA and disclose this information to the public; prohibit use of tobacco containing a pesticide chemical residue at a level greater than allowed under Federal law; establish good manufacturing practices to be followed at tobacco manufacturing facilities; authorize the FDA to place more severe restrictions on the advertising, marketing and sale of tobacco products; permit inconsistent state regulation of labeling and advertising and eliminate the existing federal preemption of such regulation; authorize the FDA to require the reduction of nicotine and the reduction or elimination of other constituents; and grant the FDA the regulatory authority to impose broad additional restrictions. The U.S. Congress did limit the FDAs authority in two areas, prohibiting it from: banning all tobacco products; and requiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero. A Center for Tobacco Products has been established within the FDA, funded through quarterly user fees that will be assessed against tobacco product manufacturers and importers based on market share. The total amount of user fees to be collected over the first ten years will be approximately $5.4 billion. The expense related to the FDA user fees of RAIs operating companies was $22 million in 2009, and the expense for 2010 will be approximately $75 million to $85 million. Within the Center, a Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee will provide advice, information and recommendations with respect to the safety, dependence or health issues related to tobacco products, including: a recommendation on modified risk applications; a recommendation as to whether there is a threshold level below which nicotine yields do not produce dependence; a report on the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on the public health; and a report on the impact of dissolvable tobacco products on the public health. In February 2010, RJR Tobacco received a letter from the Center for Tobacco Products (which letter is available on the FDAs web site) requesting, in connection with the Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committees study of dissolvable tobacco products, certain information regarding the perception and use of CAMEL Dissolvables. RJR Tobacco, which markets its tobacco products only to adult tobacco users, intends to respond to FDAs information request. On August 31, 2009, RJR Tobacco and Conwood joined other tobacco manufacturers and a tobacco retailer in filing a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky (Commonwealth Brands, Inc. v. United States of America), challenging certain provisions of the FDA Tobacco Act that severely restrict the few remaining channels available to communicate with adult tobacco consumers. RAI believes these provisions cannot be justified on any basis consistent with the demands of the First Amendment. The suit does not challenge the U.S. Congresss decision to give the FDA regulatory authority over tobacco products, nor does it challenge the vast majority of the provisions of the new law. For further information regarding this case, see Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. 53 Table of Contents It is likely that the FDA Tobacco Act could result in a decrease in cigarette and smokeless tobacco sales in the United States, including sales of RJR Tobaccos and Conwoods brands, and an increase in costs to RJR Tobacco and Conwood that could have a material adverse effect on RAIs financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. RAI believes that such regulation may adversely affect the ability of its operating subsidiaries to compete against their larger competitor, which may be able to more quickly and cost effectively comply with these new rules and regulations. The FDA has yet to issue guidance with respect to many provisions of the FDA Tobacco Act, which may result in less efficient compliance efforts. Finally, the ability of RAIs operating companies to gain efficient market clearance for new tobacco products could be affected by FDA rules and regulations. Legislation imposing various restrictions on public smoking also has been enacted by 49 states and many local jurisdictions, and many employers have initiated programs restricting or eliminating smoking in the workplace. A number of states have enacted legislation designating a portion of increased cigarette excise taxes to fund either anti smoking programs, health care programs or cancer research. In addition, educational and research programs addressing health care issues related to smoking are being funded from industry payments made or to be made under settlements with state attorneys general. Federal law prohibits smoking in scheduled passenger aircraft, and the U.S. Interstate Commerce Commission has banned smoking on buses transporting passengers interstate. Certain common carriers have imposed additional restrictions on passenger smoking. In 2003, the California Environmental Protection Agency Air Resources Board issued a Proposed Identification of Environmental Tobacco Smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant for public review. In 2006, the Air Resources Board identified environmental tobacco smoke as a Toxic Air Contaminant, following a three year administrative process. The Air Resources Board is now required to prepare a report assessing the need and appropriate degree of control of environmental tobacco smoke. RJR Tobacco cannot predict the form any future California regulation may take. In 2003, the New York Office of Fire Prevention and Control issued a final standard with accompanying regulations that requires all cigarettes offered for sale in New York State after June 28, 2004, to achieve specified test results when placed on ten layers of filter paper in controlled laboratory conditions. As of December 31, 2009, 48 states in addition to New York, as well as Washington, D.C., had enacted fire standards compliance legislation of their own, adopting the same testing standard set forth in the OFPC regulations described above. The cigarettes that RAIs operating companies sell in these jurisdictions comply with this standard. Wyoming remains the only state to not have enacted this type of legislation. Recognizing these legislative trends in conjunction with its effort to increase productivity and reduce complexity, RJR Tobacco voluntarily converted all of its brands to fire standard compliance paper by the end of 2009. In July 2007, the State of Maine became the first state to enact a statute that prohibits the sale of cigarettes and cigars that have a characterizing flavor. The legislation defines characterizing flavor as a distinguishable taste or aroma that is imparted to tobacco or tobacco smoke either prior to or during consumption, other than a taste or aroma from tobacco, menthol, clove, coffee, nuts or peppers. In October 2008, the State of New Jersey passed a similar ban on flavored cigarettes with a similar definition of characterizing flavor but excluding only tobacco, menthol or clove. Additionally, New Jersey extended the ban not only to whether the product itself has a characterizing flavor as part of the aroma of the product or smoke, but also if the product was marketed or advertised as producing such a flavor, taste or aroma. During 2009, New York City passed legislation that would ban characterizing flavors in tobacco products other than cigarettes beginning on February 25, 2010. An exemption applies if the characterizing flavor is tobacco, menthol, mint or wintergreen. U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Manufacturing Co. LLC and U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Brands, Inc. filed suit in federal court on January 7, 2010, claiming that the local law is preempted by the FDA Tobacco Act and violates the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Similar bills banning characterizing flavors in tobacco products are pending in other states. Effective October 1, 2008, the San Francisco Board of Supervisors adopted a ban on the sale of tobacco products in some pharmacies. During 2009, the Boston Public Health Commission and the Massachusetts communities of Uxbridge and Needham instituted similar bans. 54 Table of Contents A price differential exists between cigarettes manufactured for sale abroad and cigarettes manufactured for sale in the United States. Consequently, a domestic gray market has developed in cigarettes manufactured for sale abroad, but instead diverted for domestic sales that compete with cigarettes that RJR Tobacco manufactures for domestic sale. The U.S. federal government and all states, except Massachusetts, have enacted legislation prohibiting the sale and distribution of gray market cigarettes. In addition, RJR Tobacco has taken legal action against distributors and retailers who engage in such practices. RJR Tobacco expects to benefit from certain state legislative activity aimed at leveling the playing field between original participating manufacturers under the MSA and nonparticipating manufacturers under the MSA, referred to as NPMs. Forty six states have passed legislation to ensure NPMs are making required escrow payments. Under this legislation, a state would only permit distribution of brands by manufacturers who are deemed by the states to be MSA compliant. Failure to make escrow payments could result in the loss of an NPMs ability to sell tobacco products in a respective state. Additionally, 44 states have enacted legislation that closes a loophole in the MSA. The loophole allows NPMs that concentrate their sales in a single state, or a limited number of states, to recover most of the funds from their escrow accounts. To obtain the refunds, the manufacturers must establish that their escrow deposit was greater than the amount the state would have received had the manufacturer been a subsequent participating manufacturer under the MSA, that is, the states allocable share. The National Association of Attorneys General, referred to as NAAG, has endorsed adoption of the allocable share legislation needed to eliminate this loophole. Following a challenge by NPMs, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York has issued an order enjoining New York from enforcing allocable share legislation. It is possible that NPMs will challenge allocable share legislation passed in other states. Finally, four states, Alaska, Michigan, Minnesota and Utah, have enacted equity assessments on NPMs products. This legislative initiative has not been endorsed by NAAG, and one NPM has filed a challenge to the equity assessment in Michigan. Forty two states by statute or court rule have limited, and several additional states are considering limiting, the amount of the bonds required to file an appeal of an adverse judgment in state court. The limitation on the amount of such bonds generally ranges from $1 million to $150 million. Bonding statutes in 37 states allow defendants that are subject to large adverse judgments, such as cigarette manufacturers, to reasonably bond such judgments and pursue the appellate process. In five other states and Puerto Rico, the filing of a notice of appeal automatically stays the judgment of the trial court. In 2003, the World Health Organization adopted a broad tobacco control treaty. The treaty recommends and requires enactment of legislation establishing specific actions to prevent youth smoking, restrict and gradually eliminate tobacco products marketing, provide greater regulation and disclosure of ingredients, increase the size and scope of package warning labels to cover at least 30% of each package and include graphic pictures on packages. The treaty entered into force on February 27, 2005 90 days after ratification by the 40th country. In February 2006, the first session of the Conference of the Parties, referred to as the COP, occurred in Geneva, Switzerland. The COP, among other actions taken, established a permanent secretariat, adopted a budget, and created working groups to begin to develop protocols on cross border advertising and illegal trade and guidelines on establishing smoke free places and regulating tobacco products. Among the decisions taken at the COPs second session, in July 2007, the COP adopted guidelines from the working group on the protection from exposure to tobacco smoke and called for an intergovernmental negotiating body to negotiate a protocol on illicit trade. At the COPs third conference, in November 2008, the parties adopted guidelines with respect to various provisions of the tobacco control treaty, including the packaging and labeling of tobacco products. The fourth COP session is scheduled to be held in Uruguay in late 2010. Although the U.S. delegate to the World Health Organization voted for the treaty in May 2003, and the Secretary for Health and Human Services signed the document in May 2004, the Bush Administration did not send the treaty to the U.S. Senate for ratification. Ratification by the United States could lead to broader regulation of the industry. 55 Table of Contents It is not possible to determine what additional federal, state or local legislation or regulations relating to smoking or cigarettes will be enacted or to predict the effect of new legislation or regulations on RJR Tobacco or the cigarette industry in general, but any new legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on RJR Tobacco or the cigarette industry in general. Similarly, it is not possible to determine what additional federal, state or local legislation or regulations relating to smokeless tobacco products will be enacted or to predict the effect of new regulation on Conwood or smokeless tobacco products in general, but any new legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on Conwood or smokeless tobacco products in general.

These statements regarding future events or the future performance or results of RAI and its subsidiaries inherently are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include: the substantial and increasing taxation and regulation of tobacco products, including the recent federal excise tax increases, and the regulation of tobacco products by the FDA; the possibility that the FDA will issue a regulation prohibiting menthol as a flavor in cigarettes or that the FDA will extend the ban on characterizing flavors to smokeless tobacco products; various legal actions, proceedings and claims relating to the sale, distribution, manufacture, development, advertising, marketing and claimed health effects of tobacco products that are pending or may be instituted against RAI or its subsidiaries; the potential difficulty of obtaining bonds as a result of litigation outcomes; the substantial payment obligations with respect to cigarette sales, and the substantial limitations on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes (and RJR Tobaccos smoke free tobacco products) under the State Settlement Agreements; the continuing decline in volume in the U.S. cigarette industry and RAIs dependence on the U.S. cigarette industry; concentration of a material amount of sales with a single customer or distributor; competition from other manufacturers, including industry consolidations or any new entrants in the marketplace; 56 Table of Contents increased promotional activities by competitors, including deep discount cigarette brands; the success or failure of new product innovations and acquisitions; the responsiveness of both the trade and consumers to new products, marketing strategies and promotional programs; the ability to achieve efficiencies in the businesses of RAIs operating companies, including outsourcing functions, without negatively affecting sales; the reliance on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials; the cost of tobacco leaf and other raw materials and other commodities used in products; the effect of market conditions on interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and the return on corporate cash; declining liquidity in the financial markets, including bankruptcy of lenders participating in the credit facility; the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, including trademarks; the effect of market conditions on the performance of pension assets or any adverse effects of any new legislation or regulations changing pension expense accounting or required pension funding levels; the substantial amount of RAI debt; the credit rating of RAI and its securities; any restrictive covenants imposed under RAIs debt agreements; the possibility of fire, violent weather and other disasters that may adversely affect manufacturing and other facilities; the significant ownership interest of BW, RAIs largest shareholder, in RAI and the rights of BW under the governance agreement between the companies; the expiration of the standstill provisions of the governance agreement; and the potential existence of significant deficiencies or material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting that may be identified during the performance of testing required under Section 404 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. RAI and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to their normal investing and funding activities. In addition, RAI and its subsidiaries have immaterial exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk concerning investments in, or obligations for, and service agreements related to, foreign operations denominated in euros, British pounds, Swiss francs, Swedish krona, Chinese renminbi and Japanese yen. RAI and its subsidiaries have established policies and procedures to manage their exposure to market risks and use major institutions as counterparties to minimize their investment and credit risk. Frequently, these institutions are also members of the bank group that provide RAI credit, and management believes this further minimizes the risk of nonperformance. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes. 57 Table of Contents The table below provides information about RAIs financial instruments, as of December 31, 2009, that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
