Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following is a discussion and analysis of RAIs business, initiatives, critical accounting policies and its consolidated results of operations and financial position. Following the overview and discussion of business initiatives, the critical accounting policies disclose certain accounting policies that are material to RAIs results of operations and financial position for the periods presented in this report. The discussion and analysis of RAIs results of operations is presented in two comparative sections, 2010 compared with 2009, and 2009 compared with 2008. Disclosures related to liquidity and financial position complete managements discussion and analysis. You should read this discussion and analysis of RAIs consolidated financial position and results of operations in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, and for each of the years in the three year period ended December 31, 2010. Overview and Business Initiatives RAIs reportable operating segments are RJR Tobacco and American Snuff. The RJR Tobacco segment consists of the primary operations of R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company. The American Snuff segment consists of the primary operations of American Snuff Co. and Lane. On January 13, 2011, RAI reached an agreement to sell all the capital stock of Lane and certain other assets related to the Lane operations, to an affiliate of Scandinavian Tobacco Group A/S for approximately $200 million in cash. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2011, pending antitrust review and approval. Two of RAIs wholly owned subsidiaries, Santa Fe and Niconovum AB, among others, are included in All Other. RAIs wholly owned operating subsidiaries have entered into intercompany agreements for products or services with other RAI operating subsidiaries. As a result, certain activities of an operating subsidiary may be included in a different segment of RAI. RAIs largest reportable operating segment, RJR Tobacco, is the second largest cigarette manufacturer in the United States. RJR Tobaccos largest selling cigarette brands, CAMEL, PALL MALL, WINSTON, KOOL, DORAL and SALEM, were six of the ten best selling brands of cigarettes in the United States as of December 31, 2010. Those brands, and its other brands, including MISTY and CAPRI, are manufactured in a variety of styles and marketed in the United States. RJR Tobacco also manages contract manufacturing of cigarettes and tobacco products through arrangements with BAT affiliates. RAIs other reportable operating segment, American Snuff, is the second largest smokeless tobacco products manufacturer in the United States. American Snuffs primary brands include its largest selling moist snuff brands, GRIZZLY and KODIAK. American Snuff also distributes a variety of other tobacco products, including WINCHESTER and CAPTAIN BLACK little cigars, and BUGLER roll your own tobacco that are included in the pending sale of Lane. Santa Fe manufactures and markets cigarettes and other tobacco products under the NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand, as well as manages RJR Tobaccos super premium cigarette brands, DUNHILL and STATE EXPRESS 555, which are licensed from BAT. RJR Tobacco RJR Tobacco primarily conducts business in the highly competitive U.S. cigarette market, which has a few large manufacturers and many smaller participants. The U.S. cigarette market is a mature market in which overall consumer demand has declined since 1981 and is expected to continue to decline. Profitability of the U.S. cigarette industry and RJR Tobacco continues to be adversely impacted by decreases in consumption, increases in state 26 Table of Contents excise taxes and governmental regulations and restrictions, such as marketing limitations, product standards and ingredients legislation. The international rights to substantially all of RJR Tobaccos brands were sold in 1999 to JTI and no international rights were acquired in connection with the BW business combination. RJR Tobacco offers two types of modern smoke free tobacco, CAMEL Snus and CAMEL Dissolvables. CAMEL Snus is pasteurized tobacco in a small pouch that provides convenient tobacco consumption. CAMEL Dissolvables include CAMEL Orbs, Sticks and Strips, all of which are made of finely milled tobacco and dissolve completely in the mouth. RJR Tobaccos brand portfolio strategy is based upon three brand categories: growth, support and non support. The growth brands consist of a premium brand, CAMEL, and a value brand, PALL MALL. Although both of these brands are managed for long term market share and profit growth, CAMEL will continue to receive the most significant investment support. The support brands include four premium brands, WINSTON, KOOL, SALEM and CAPRI, and two value brands, DORAL and MISTY, all of which receive limited marketing support. The non support brands, consisting of all other brands, are managed to maximize near term profitability. The key objectives of the portfolio strategy are designed to focus on the long term market share growth of the growth brands while managing the support brands for long term sustainability and profitability. Consistent with that strategy, RJR Tobacco has discontinued many of its non core cigarette styles as well as private label cigarette brands. RJR Tobaccos modern smoke free products are marketed under the CAMEL brand and focus on long term growth. Competition is based primarily on brand positioning, including price, product attributes and packaging, consumer loyalty, promotions, advertising and retail presence. Cigarette brands produced by the major manufacturers generally require competitive pricing, substantial marketing support, retail programs and other incentives to maintain or improve market position or to introduce a new brand style. RJR Tobacco is committed to building and maintaining a portfolio of profitable brands. RJR Tobaccos marketing programs are designed to strengthen brand image, build brand awareness and loyalty, and switch adult smokers of competing brands to RJR Tobacco brands. In addition to building strong brand equity, RJR Tobaccos marketing approach utilizes a retail pricing strategy, including discounting at retail, to defend certain brands shares of market against competitive pricing pressure. RJR Tobaccos competitive pricing methods may include list price changes, discounting programs, such as retail and wholesale buydowns, periodic price reductions, off invoice price reductions, dollar off promotions and consumer coupons. Retail buydowns refer to payments made to the retailer to reduce the price that consumers pay at retail. Consumer coupons generally are distributed by a variety of methods, including in, or on, the pack and by direct mail. American Snuff American Snuff offers a range of differentiated smokeless and other tobacco products to adult consumers. The moist snuff category is divided into premium and price value brands. The moist snuff category has developed many of the characteristics of the larger, cigarette market, including multiple pricing tiers with intense competition, focused marketing programs and significant product innovation. In contrast to the declining U.S. cigarette market, U.S. moist snuff volumes grew over 8% in 2010. Profit margins on moist snuff products are generally higher than on cigarette products. Moist snuffs growth is partially attributable to cigarette smokers switching from cigarettes to smokeless tobacco products or using both. The growth in moist snuff volumes in 2010 is higher than prior years due to competitive promotional strategies during 2010 and a change in competitive shipments reporting, which excludes product returns. American Snuff faces significant competition in the smokeless tobacco categories. Similar to the cigarette market, competition is based primarily on brand positioning and price, as well as product attributes and packaging, consumer loyalty, promotions, advertising and retail presence. 27 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, referred to as GAAP, require estimates and assumptions to be made that affect the reported amounts in RAIs consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Some of these estimates require difficult, subjective and or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain, and as a result, actual results could differ from those estimates. Due to the estimation processes involved, the following summarized accounting policies and their application are considered to be critical to understanding the business operations, financial position and results of operations of RAI and its subsidiaries. For information related to these and other significant accounting policies, see Item 8, note 1 to consolidated financial statements. Litigation RAI discloses information concerning litigation for which an unfavorable outcome is more than remote. RAI and its subsidiaries record their legal expenses and other litigation costs and related administrative costs as selling, general and administrative expenses as those costs are incurred. RAI and its subsidiaries will record any loss related to litigation at such time as an unfavorable outcome becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. When the reasonable estimate is a range, the recorded loss will be the best estimate within the range. If no amount in the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount of the range will be recorded. As discussed in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements, RJR Tobacco, American Snuff Co. and their affiliates, including RAI, and indemnitees, have been named in a number of tobacco related legal actions, proceedings or claims seeking damages in amounts ranging into the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. Unfavorable judgments have been returned in a number of tobacco related cases and state enforcement actions. As of December 31, 2010, RJR Tobacco had paid approximately $24 million since January 1, 2008, related to unfavorable judgments. RAI and its subsidiaries believe that they have valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against them and have valid defenses to all actions, and they intend to defend all actions vigorously. RAIs management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees, including BW, or the loss of any particular claim concerning the use of smokeless tobacco against American Snuff Co., when viewed on an individual basis, is not probable or estimable. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and it is possible that some of the tobacco related legal actions, proceedings or claims could ultimately be decided against RJR Tobacco, American Snuff Co. or their affiliates, including RAI, and indemnitees. Any unfavorable outcome of such actions could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of RAI or its subsidiaries. For further discussion of the litigation and legal proceedings pending against RAI or its affiliates or indemnitees, see Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Settlement Agreements RJR Tobacco, Santa Fe and Lane are participants in the MSA, and RJR Tobacco is a participant in the other State Settlement Agreements. Their obligations and the related expense charges under the State Settlement Agreements are subject to adjustments based upon, among other things, the volume of cigarettes sold by the operating subsidiaries, their relative market share and inflation. Since relative market share is based on cigarette shipments, the best estimate of the allocation of charges to RJR Tobacco under these agreements is recorded in cost of products sold as the products are shipped. Adjustments to these estimates are recorded in the period that the change becomes probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated. American Snuff Co. is not a participant in the State Settlement Agreements. For more information related to historical and expected settlement expenses and payments under the State Settlement Agreements, see Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Health Care Cost Recovery Cases State Settlement Agreements and State Settlement Agreements Enforcement and Validity in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. 28 Table of Contents Intangible Assets Intangible assets include goodwill, trademarks and other intangibles. The determination of fair value involves considerable estimates and judgment. For goodwill, the determination of fair value of a reporting unit involves, among other things, RAIs market capitalization, and application of the income approach, which includes developing forecasts of future cash flows and determining an appropriate discount rate. If goodwill impairment is implied, the fair values of individual assets and liabilities, including unrecorded intangibles, must be determined. RAI believes it has based its goodwill impairment testing on reasonable estimates and assumptions, and during the annual testing in the fourth quarter of 2010, the estimated fair value of each of RAIs reporting units was substantially in excess of its respective carrying value. Trademarks and other intangible assets with indefinite lives also are tested for impairment annually, in the fourth quarter. The aggregate fair value of RAIs operating units trademarks and other intangible assets was substantially in excess of their aggregate carrying value. However, the individual fair values of two indefinite lived trademarks were less than 15% in excess of their respective carrying values. The aggregate carrying value of these two trademarks was $53 million at December 31, 2010. The methodology used to determine the fair value of trademarks includes assumptions with inherent uncertainty, including projected sales volumes and related projected revenues, long term growth rates, royalty rates that a market participant might assume and judgments regarding the factors to develop an applied discount rate. The carrying value of intangible assets are at risk of impairment if future projected revenues or long term growth rates are lower than those currently projected, or if factors used in the development of a discount rate result in the application of a higher discount rate. Goodwill, all trademarks and other intangible assets are tested more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. The carrying value of these intangible assets could be impaired if a significant adverse change in the use, life, or brand strategy of the asset is determined, or if a significant adverse change in the legal and regulatory environment, business or competitive climate occurs that would adversely impact the asset. See Item 8, note 3 to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the impairment charges. Fair Value Measurement RAI determines fair value of certain of its assets and liabilities using a fair value hierarchy that distinguishes between market participant assumptions based on market data obtained from sources independent of the reporting entity, and the reporting entitys own assumptions about market participant assumptions based on the best information available in the circumstances. Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, essentially an exit price. The levels of the fair value hierarchy are: Level 1: inputs are quoted prices, unadjusted, in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date. Level 2: inputs are other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. A Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability. Level 3: inputs are unobservable and reflect the reporting entitys own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. See Item 8, note 2 to consolidated financial statements for information on assets and liabilities recorded at fair value. 29 Table of Contents Investments Marketable securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value. RAI reviews these investments on a quarterly basis to determine if it is probable that RAI will realize some portion of the unrealized loss and to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary. For those securities that RAI does not intend to sell and it is more likely than not that RAI will not be required to sell such securities prior to recovery, RAI recognizes the credit loss component of an other than temporary impairment in earnings, and recognizes the noncredit component in other comprehensive loss. As of December 31, 2010, RAI held investments primarily in auction rate securities, a mortgage backed security and a marketable equity security. In determining if the impairment of the auction rate securities or the mortgage backed security was deemed either temporary or other than temporary, RAI evaluated each type of long term investment using a set of criteria including decline in value, duration of the decline, period until anticipated recovery, nature of investment, probability of recovery, financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, RAIs intent and ability to retain the investment, attributes of the decline in value, status with rating agencies, status of principal and interest payments and any other issues related to the underlying securities. RAI uses historical default rates, debt ratings, credit default swap spreads and recovery rates to determine if credit losses have been incurred. RAI has the intent and ability to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for the recovery in market value. See Item 8, note 2 to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of investments. Pension and Postretirement Benefits RAI and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor a number of non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering most of their employees, and also provide certain health and life insurance benefits for most of their retired employees and their dependents. These benefits are generally no longer provided to employees hired on or after January 1, 2004. For additional information relating to pension and postretirement benefits, see Item 8, note 17 to consolidated financial statements. Because pension and other postretirement obligations ultimately will be settled in future periods, the determination of annual expense and liabilities is subject to estimates and assumptions. RAI reviews these assumptions annually based on historic experience and expected future trends or coincidental with a major event and modifies them as needed. Demographic assumptions such as termination of employment, mortality or retirement are reviewed periodically as expectations change. Gains or losses are annual changes in the amount of either the benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets resulting from experience different from that assumed or from changes in assumptions. The minimum amortization of unrecognized gains or losses is included in pension expense. Prior service costs, which are changes in benefit obligations due to plan amendments, are amortized on a straight line basis over the average remaining service period for active employees, or average remaining life expectancies for inactive employees if most of the plan obligations are due to inactive employees. The minimum amortization of unrecognized gains or losses is also included in the postretirement benefit expense. Prior service costs, which are changes in benefit obligations due to plan amendments, are amortized on a straight line basis over the service to expected full eligibility age for active employees, or average remaining life expectancies for inactive employees if most of the plan obligations are due to inactive employees. Differences between actual results and actuarial assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods. In recent years, actual results have varied significantly from actuarial assumptions. In particular, pension and postretirement obligations have increased due to significant decreases in discount rates. These changes have resulted in an increase in charges to other comprehensive loss and increased pension and postretirement expense. The Pension Protection Act may require additional cash funding of the increased pension obligations in the future. 30 Table of Contents The most critical assumptions and their sensitivity to change are presented below: Assumed asset return and discount rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the benefit plans. A one percentage point change in assumed discount rate for the pension plans and other postretirement plans would have had the following effects: 1 Percentage Point 1 Percentage Point Increase Decrease Pension Postretirement Pension Postretirement Plans Plans Plans Plans Effect on 2010 net periodic benefit cost $ (24 ) $ (5 ) $ 32 $ 3 Effect on December 31, 2010, projected benefit obligation and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (539 ) (136 ) 651 160 A one percentage point change in assumed asset return would have had the following effects: 1 Percentage Point 1 Percentage Point Increase Decrease Pension Postretirement Pension Postretirement Plans Plans Plans Plans Effect on 2010 net periodic benefit cost $ (44 ) $ (3 ) $ 44 $ 3 Income Taxes Tax law requires certain items to be excluded or included in taxable income at different times than is required for book reporting purposes. These differences may be permanent or temporary in nature. RAI determines its annual effective income tax rate based on forecasted pre tax book income and forecasted permanent book and tax differences. The rate is established at the beginning of the year and is evaluated on a quarterly basis. Any changes to the forecasted information may cause the effective rate to be adjusted. Additional tax, interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions are recognized in tax expense on a quarterly basis. To the extent that any book and tax differences are temporary in nature, that is, the book realization will occur in a different period than the tax realization, a deferred tax asset or liability is established. To the extent that a deferred tax asset is created, management evaluates RAIs ability to realize this asset. Management currently believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets recorded in RAIs consolidated balance sheet will be realized. To the extent a deferred tax liability is established, it is recorded, tracked and, once it becomes currently due and payable, paid to the taxing authorities. The financial statements reflect managements best estimate of RAIs current and deferred tax liabilities and assets. Future events, including but not limited to, additional resolutions with taxing authorities could have an impact on RAIs current estimate of tax liabilities, realization of tax assets and upon RAIs effective income tax rate. See Item 8, note 11 to consolidated financial statements for additional information on income taxes.

Percentages are calculated on unrounded numbers. (2) Based on information from MSAi. RJR Tobaccos net sales are dependent upon its cigarette shipment volume in a declining market, premium versus value brand mix and list pricing, offset by promotional spending, trade incentives and federal excise taxes. RJR Tobacco also believes its consumers are more price sensitive than consumers of competing brands and, therefore, are more negatively affected by an increase in the federal excise tax and by the current adverse economic environment. RJR Tobaccos net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased from the year ended December 31, 2009, driven by higher pricing of $551 million, partially offset by $459 million attributable to lower cigarette volume and an unfavorable premium to value brand mix. 33 Table of Contents The shares of RJR Tobaccos brands as a percentage of total share of U.S. retail cigarette sales according to data(1) from IRI/Capstone, were as follows(2): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Share Point 2010 2009 Change Growth brands: CAMEL excluding non filter 7.7 % 7.5 % 0.2 PALL MALL 7.4 % 4.8 % 2.7 Total growth brands 15.1 % 12.3 % 2.8 Support brands 11.2 % 13.1 % (1.9 ) Non support brands 1.7 % 2.9 % (1.2 ) Total domestic 28.1 % 28.3 % (0.2 ) (1) Retail share of U.S. cigarette sales data is included in this document because it is used by RJR Tobacco primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants, and brands and market trends. You should not rely on the market share data reported by IRI/Capstone as being a precise measurement of actual market share because IRI/Capstone is not able to effectively track all volume. Moreover, you should be aware that in a product market experiencing overall declining consumption, a particular product can experience increasing market share relative to competing products, yet still be subject to declining consumption volumes. (2) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. The retail share of market of CAMELs filtered styles increased in 2010 compared with 2009, favorably impacted by product upgrades in two core menthol styles in late 2009. These styles now feature the same innovative capsule technology used in CAMEL Crush, allowing adult smokers to choose the level of menthol flavor on demand. CAMEL Crush, featuring the menthol capsule, allows adult smokers the choice between regular or menthol. CAMEL Crush has captured 0.8 share points as of December 31, 2010, as the success of this style continues to be a key driver in the growing menthol category. CAMEL Snus, a modern smoke free tobacco product, was launched in select outlets, nationally, in 2009 and continues to bring awareness to this new smoke free category. Two new styles of CAMEL Snus, Robust and Winterchill, were launched nationwide during the third quarter of 2010. These two new styles are packaged in larger pouches and offer a richer and more full bodied tobacco taste. RJR Tobacco is making product and packaging upgrades to CAMELs line of innovative dissolvable tobacco products, orbs, sticks and strips, which will be launched in two new lead markets during March 2011. PALL MALL, the nations fourth largest and fastest growing major cigarette brand, increased market share in 2010 compared with 2009, due, in managements belief, to adult consumers switching brands seeking greater value. PALL MALL, positioned as a product that offers a longer lasting cigarette at a value price, has retained a high percentage of adult smokers who try the brand. The combined share of market of RJR Tobaccos growth brands during 2010 showed improvement over 2009. RJR Tobaccos total cigarette market share has remained stable from the prior year despite the fact that RJR Tobacco has discontinued many of its non core cigarette styles and de emphasized private label cigarette brands. These actions are consistent with RJR Tobaccos strategy of focusing on growth brands. Operating Income RJR Tobaccos operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased from the year ended December 31, 2009, due to higher cigarette pricing and continued productivity gains. In addition to streamlining product offerings, RJR Tobacco has also eliminated non essential activities and outsourced non core functions. Partially offsetting these gains were lower cigarette volume, the payment of a legal judgment and higher FDA user 34 Table of Contents fees. Additionally, unfavorable premium to value mix and asset impairment charges of $24 million related to a plant closing impacted the operating income in 2010. Trademark impairment charges of $491 million were recorded in 2009 as the result of impairment testing to reflect the forecasted sales impact due to the increase in the federal excise tax and as the result of annual impairment testing of brand trademarks. RJR Tobaccos State Settlement Agreements and federal tobacco buyout expenses and FDA user fees, included in cost of products sold, are detailed in the schedule below: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2010 2009 Settlements $ 2,432 $ 2,490 Federal tobacco quota buyout $ 232 $ 231 FDA user fees $ 71 $ 21 Expenses under the State Settlement Agreements are expected to be approximately $2.5 billion in 2011, subject to adjustment for changes in volume and other factors, and expense for the federal tobacco quota buyout is expected to be approximately $220 million to $250 million in 2011. Expenses for FDA user fees are expected to be approximately $110 million to $120 million in 2011. For additional information, see Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Health Care Cost Recovery Cases State Settlement Agreements in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs of litigating and administering product liability claims, as well as other legal expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, RJR Tobaccos product liability defense costs were $153 million and $123 million, respectively. The increase in product liability defense costs in 2010 compared with 2009 is due primarily to the increase in the number of Engle Progeny cases in or scheduled for trial. For more information, see Individual Smoking and Health Cases Engle Progeny Cases in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Product liability cases generally include the following types of smoking and health related cases: Individual Smoking and Health; West Virginia IPIC; Engle Progeny; Broin II; Class Actions; and Health Care Cost Recovery Claims. Product liability defense costs include the following items: direct and indirect compensation, fees and related costs and expenses for internal legal and related administrative staff administering product liability claims; fees and cost reimbursements paid to outside attorneys; direct and indirect payments to third party vendors for litigation support activities; expert witness costs and fees; and payments to fund legal defense costs for the now dissolved Council for Tobacco Research U.S.A. Numerous factors affect product liability defense costs. The most important factors are the number of cases pending and the number of cases in trial or in preparation for trial, that is, with active discovery and motions practice. See Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Overview in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements for detailed information regarding the number and type of cases pending, and Litigation Affecting the 35 Table of Contents Cigarette Industry Scheduled Trials in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements for detailed information regarding the number and nature of cases in trial and scheduled for trial through December 31, 2011. RJR Tobacco expects that the factors described above will continue to have the primary impact on its product liability defense costs in the future. Given the increased level of activity in RJR Tobaccos pending cases and possible new cases, including the increased number of cases in trial and scheduled for trial, particularly with respect to the Engle Progeny cases, RJR Tobaccos product liability defense costs have increased in 2010 compared with the most recent years. See Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Engle and Engle Progeny Cases in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements for additional information. In addition, it is possible that adverse developments in the factors discussed above, as well as other circumstances beyond the control of RJR Tobacco, could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position of RAI or its subsidiaries. Those other circumstances beyond the control of RJR Tobacco include the results of present and future trials and appeals, and the development of possible new theories of liability by plaintiffs and their counsel. American Snuff Net Sales The moist snuff shipment volume, in millions of cans, for American Snuff was as follows(1): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2010 2009 % Change KODIAK 47.5 47.8 (0.6 )% GRIZZLY 325.3 304.6 6.8 % Other 4.5 4.1 11.2 % Total moist snuff 377.3 356.5 5.8 % (1) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. Percentages are calculated on unrounded numbers. American Snuffs net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010, were favorably impacted by higher moist snuff volume and pricing. Shipments of GRIZZLY, American Snuffs leading price value brand, increased in 2010 with gains on core styles. Shipments of KODIAK, American Snuffs leading premium brand, declined slightly in 2010 due to competitive promotional activity. The American Snuff shares of the moist snuff category as a percentage of total share of U.S. shipments of moist snuff, according to distributor reported data(1) processed by MSAi, were as follows(2): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Share 2010 2009 Point Change KODIAK 3.6 % 3.8 % (0.2 ) GRIZZLY 25.3 % 25.3 % Other 0.3 % 0.3 % Total moist snuff 29.2 % 29.4 % (0.2 ) (1) Distributor shipments to retail share of U.S. moist snuff is included in this document because it is used by American Snuff primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants, and brands and market trends. You should not rely on the market share data reported by distributors and processed by MSAi as being a precise measurement of actual market share because this distributor data set is not able to effectively track all volume. (2) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. 36 Table of Contents Moist snuff has been the key driver to American Snuffs overall growth and profitability within the U.S. smokeless tobacco market. Moist snuff accounted for approximately 74% of American Snuffs revenue in 2010 and approximately 71% in 2009. Moist snuff industry volume grew 8% in 2010 compared to 2009, due to competitive promotional strategies in 2010 and a change in competitive shipments reporting, which excludes product returns. GRIZZLYs market share of moist snuff shipments in 2010 was stable compared to 2009 despite competitive promotional activity and line extensions. In the first quarter of 2010, embossed metal lids were launched across the entire brand. In the industry, pouch styles have grown nearly 21% in 2010, and now account for nearly 9% of moist snuff sales. GRIZZLYs pouch styles accounted for over 24% of the pouch segment at December 31, 2010. The shipment share of KODIAK in 2010 was down slightly compared with 2009, due to competitive promotional activity. KODIAK upgraded to embossed metal lids in 2010 to further enhance the brands premium image. Operating Income American Snuffs operating income for the year ended December 31, 2010, increased due to higher volume and pricing. In addition, as a result of fourth quarter testing, a trademark impairment charge of $6 million was recorded in 2010 compared with a trademark impairment charge of $76 million in 2009, which was due to the forecasted sales impact of the increase in federal excise tax. The impairment charges were based on the excess of each brands carrying value over its fair value using the present value of estimated future cash flows assuming a discount rate of 10.5%. During the fourth quarter of 2010, in order to facilitate its strategic focus on key brands in the cigarette, moist snuff and modern smoke free categories of the tobacco business, RAI determined that it was probable that it would dispose of the operations of Lane. In connection with this determination, the goodwill of American Snuff was allocated between the disposal group and the retained operations based on relative fair values. The resulting goodwill was tested for impairment comparing its fair value with its carrying value. Because the fair value, less estimated cost of disposal, of the disposal group was less than its carrying value, a goodwill impairment loss of $26 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2010. All Other All Other sales for the year ended December 31, 2010, were favorably impacted by the growth of Santa Fes NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand. Operating income for the 2010 year increased as a result of higher sales in 2010 as compared with 2009. RAI Consolidated Interest and debt expense for the year ended December 31, 2010, was $232 million, a decrease of $19 million from the comparable prior year, primarily due to lower debt balances during 2010. Interest income was $12 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, a $7 million decrease compared with the year ended December 31, 2009, as a result of lower available cash to invest in 2010. Provision for income taxes of $863 million reflected an effective rate of 39.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2010, compared with $572 million for an effective rate of 37.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2009. The effective tax rate for 2010 was unfavorably impacted by a $27 million increase in tax attributable to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010 and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010. The effective tax rate for 2009 was unfavorably impacted by increases in unrecognized income tax benefits and increases in tax attributable to accumulated and undistributed foreign earnings. The effective tax rates exceeded the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of state taxes and certain non deductible items, offset by the domestic production activities deduction of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. RAI expects its effective tax rate to be approximately 38% in 2011. 37 Table of Contents 2009 Compared with 2008 For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2009 2008 % Change Net sales:(1) RJR Tobacco $ 7,334 $ 7,755 (5.4 )% American Snuff 673 723 (6.9 )% All other 412 367 12.3 % Net sales 8,419 8,845 (4.8 )% Cost of products sold(1)(2) 4,485 4,863 (7.8 )% Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,508 1,500 0.5 % Amortization expense 28 22 27.3 % Restructuring charge 56 90 (37.8 )% Trademark impairment charges 567 318 78.3 % Operating income: RJR Tobacco 1,487 1,805 (17.6 )% American Snuff 276 232 19.0 % All other 112 104 7.7 % Corporate expense (100 ) (89 ) 12.4 % $ 1,775 $ 2,052 (13.5 )% (1) Excludes excise taxes of: 2009 2008 RJR Tobacco $ 3,532 $ 1,689 American Snuff 124 20 All other 271 181 $ 3,927 $ 1,890 (2) See below for further information related to State Settlement Agreements and federal tobacco buyout expense included in cost of products sold. 38 Table of Contents RJR Tobacco Net Sales Domestic cigarette shipment volume, in billions of units for RJR Tobacco and the industry, were as follows(1): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2009 2008 % Change Growth brands: CAMEL excluding non filter 21.2 23.3 (9.2 )% PALL MALL 14.6 8.6 70.9 % 35.8 31.8 12.3 % Support brands 37.9 46.6 (18.7 )% Non support brands 8.0 11.0 (27.2 )% Total domestic 81.7 89.5 (8.7 )% Total premium 48.1 55.9 (13.9 )% Total value 33.5 33.5 (0.1 )% Premium/Total mix 59.0 % 62.5 % Industry(2): Premium 222.6 251.1 (11.3 )% Value 93.1 94.2 (1.2 )% Total domestic 315.7 345.3 (8.6 )% Premium/Total mix 70.5 % 72.7 % (1) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. Percentages are calculated on unrounded numbers. (2) Based on information from MSAi. RJR Tobaccos net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased from the year ended December 31, 2008, driven by $566 million attributable to lower cigarette volume partially offset by higher pricing of $161 million. RJR Tobaccos decreases in net sales and cigarette shipment volume primarily reflected a continued decline in consumption, partially offset by a price increase resulting from the increase in federal excise tax. RJR Tobaccos total domestic cigarette shipment volume decreased 8.7% in 2009 compared with 2008. Industry cigarette shipment volume for 2009 was down 8.6% compared with 2008. RJR Tobaccos and industry cigarette shipment volume declines for 2009 are higher than prior years as a result of the increase in the federal excise tax. The shares of RJR Tobaccos brands as a percentage of total share of U.S. retail cigarette sales according to data(1) from IRI/Capstone, were as follows(2): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Share Point 2009 2008 Change Growth brands: CAMEL excluding non filter 7.5 % 7.7 % (0.1 ) PALL MALL 4.8 % 2.7 % 2.1 Total growth brands 12.3 % 10.4 % 1.9 Support brands 13.1 % 14.6 % (1.5 ) Non support brands 2.9 % 3.5 % (0.6 ) Total domestic 28.3 % 28.4 % (0.1 ) 39 Table of Contents (1) Retail share of U.S. cigarette sales data is included in this document because it is used by RJR Tobacco primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants, and brands and market trends. You should not rely on the market share data reported by IRI/Capstone as being a precise measurement of actual market share because IRI/Capstone is not able to effectively track all volume. Moreover, you should be aware that in a product market experiencing overall declining consumption, a particular product can experience increasing market share relative to competing products, yet still be subject to declining consumption volumes. (2) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. The retail share of market of CAMELs filtered styles decreased in 2009 compared with 2008. CAMEL Crush captured 0.7 share points as of December 31, 2009, as the success of this style continued to be a key driver in the growing menthol category. RJR Tobacco expanded the use of the capsule technology found in CAMEL Crush to CAMELs core menthol styles beginning in the third quarter of 2009. CAMEL Snus was expanded nationally in the first quarter of 2009. Two new styles of CAMEL Snus were launched in limited markets in the third quarter of 2009. CAMEL Orbs were launched in three lead markets during the first quarter of 2009, and CAMEL Sticks and Strips were launched in those lead markets in the third quarter of 2009. PALL MALLs market share increased in 2009 compared with 2008, as a result, management believes, of adult consumers switching brands seeking greater value. The combined share of market of RJR Tobaccos growth brands during 2009 showed improvement over 2008. Operating Income RJR Tobaccos operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased from the year ended December 31, 2008. A trademark impairment charge of $377 million was recorded in the first quarter of 2009 as the result of impairment testing to reflect the forecasted sales impact due to the increase in the federal excise tax. An additional trademark impairment charge of $114 million was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2009 as the result of annual impairment testing of brand trademarks. During 2008, RJR Tobacco recorded trademark impairment charges of $176 million. The impairment charges were based on the excess of each brands carrying value over its fair value using the present value of estimated future cash flows assuming a discount rate of 10.5%. RJR Tobaccos operating income was unfavorably impacted by lower cigarette volume, higher pension expense and higher legal expense. Higher pricing, lower promotional spending and productivity gains resulting from the 2008 restructuring partially offset the unfavorability. In December 2009, RJR Tobacco announced the elimination of approximately 400 full time production positions. These positions were selected from employees who volunteered to be considered for job elimination. The job eliminations were substantially completed by December 31, 2010. Under existing benefit plans, $48 million of severance related cash benefits and $8 million of non cash pension related benefits comprised a restructuring charge of $56 million. None of the cash portion of the charge was paid during 2009. The cash benefits are expected to be substantially paid by December 31, 2011. Cost savings related to the restructuring were $17 million in 2010, and are expected to increase to approximately $30 million in 2011 and each year thereafter. RJR Tobaccos State Settlement Agreements and federal tobacco buyout expenses, included in cost of products sold, are detailed in the schedule below: For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2009 2008 Settlements $ 2,490 $ 2,664 Federal tobacco quota buyout $ 231 $ 240 40 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative expenses include the costs of litigating and administering product liability claims, as well as other legal expenses. For the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, RJR Tobaccos product liability defense costs were $123 million and $96 million, respectively. The increase in product liability defense costs in 2009 compared with 2008 was due primarily to the increase in the number of Engle Progeny cases in or scheduled for trial. American Snuff Net Sales The moist snuff shipment volume, in millions of cans, for American Snuff was as follows(1): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, 2009 2008 % Change KODIAK 47.8 51.0 (6.3 )% GRIZZLY 304.6 279.6 8.9 % Other 4.1 4.5 (9.9 )% Total moist snuff 356.5 335.2 6.4 % (1) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. Percentages are calculated on unrounded numbers. American Snuffs net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, were down 7% compared with the year ended December 31, 2008. GRIZZLY continued to grow moist snuff sales and was the leading moist snuff brand in the United States as of December 31, 2009. KODIAK reduced pricing at the end of the first quarter of 2009 to remain competitive. This price reduction and volume decline on KODIAK, and a delay in the price increase on GRIZZLY to cover the additional federal excise tax, were the primary drivers of the decrease in sales during 2009 compared with 2008. During 2009, in addition to aggressive promotional spending, pricing was significantly reduced by a competitor on its premium and certain price value brands. The American Snuff shares of the moist snuff category as a percentage of total share of U.S. shipments of moist snuff, according to distributor reported data(1) processed by MSAi, were as follows(2): For the Twelve Months Ended December 31, Share 2009 2008 Point Change KODIAK 3.8 % 4.0 % (0.2 ) GRIZZLY 25.3 % 23.2 % 2.0 Other 0.3 % 0.4 % (0.1 ) Total moist snuff 29.4 % 27.6 % 1.8 (1) Distributor shipments to retail share of U.S. moist snuff is included in this document because it is used by American Snuff primarily as an indicator of the relative performance of industry participants, and brands and market trends. You should not rely on the market share data reported by distributors and processed by MSAi as being a precise measurement of actual market share because this distributor data set is not able to effectively track all volume. (2) Amounts presented in this table are rounded on an individual basis and, accordingly, may not sum on an aggregate basis. Moist snuff accounted for approximately 71% of American Snuffs revenue in 2009 and approximately 66% in 2008. While industry moist snuff volume grew over 4% in 2009, American Snuffs moist snuff volume grew over 6% in 2009, attributable to its innovation, product development and brand building. 41 Table of Contents GRIZZLYs share of moist snuff shipments in 2009, increased from 2008, due in part to the success of new GRIZZLY styles. GRIZZLY launched mint and straight pouch styles in the first quarter of 2009 and GRIZZLY snuff pouches in the fourth quarter of 2009. Pouches, in the industry, grew over 25% in 2009 and accounted for nearly 8% of moist snuff sales. GRIZZLYs pouch styles generated approximately 60% of the pouch growth in the industry during 2009. The shipment share of KODIAK declined in 2009 compared with 2008, due to competitive promotional activity and the brands core markets being burdened by high tobacco taxes and the current economic recession. KODIAKs price reduction during the first quarter of 2009 aligned KODIAK with other premium brands, making it more competitive. Operating Income American Snuffs operating income for the year ended December 31, 2009, increased primarily due to a trademark impairment charge of $76 million in 2009 compared with a trademark impairment charge of $142 million in 2008. Additionally, lower margins on KODIAK and higher promotional spending due to product introductions, tax increases and competitive activity were partially offset by increases in volume and pricing by GRIZZLY. The 2009 impairment charge was the result of impairment testing triggered by certain price reductions and the anticipated sales impact of the increase in the federal excise tax effective April 1, 2009. This impairment occurred on several of American Snuffs brands, including KODIAK, driven by the decrease in its list price to meet competition, as well as the federal excise tax impact on other brands. All Other All Other sales for the year ended December 31, 2009, were favorably impacted by the growth of Santa Fes NATURAL AMERICAN SPIRIT brand. Operating income for the 2009 year increased as a result of higher sales in 2009 as compared with 2008. RAI Consolidated Interest and debt expense was $251 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, a decrease of $24 million from the prior year, primarily due to lower effective interest rates in 2009 as compared with 2008, coupled with lower debt balances during 2009. Interest income was $19 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared with $60 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, resulting from investing at lower interest rates in 2009. Gain on termination of joint venture of $328 million in 2008 resulted from the termination of the Reynolds Gallaher International Sarl joint venture. See Item 8, note 6 to consolidated financial statements for additional information related to the joint venture termination. Other expense net of $9 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, decreased $28 million from the year ended December 31, 2008. Impairments on investments deemed other than temporary of $35 million were expensed in 2008. Provision for income taxes was $572 million and reflected an effective rate of 37.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2009, compared with $790 million for an effective rate of 37.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2008. The effective tax rate for 2009 was unfavorably impacted by the increases in unrecognized income tax benefits and increases in tax attributable to accumulated and undistributed foreign earnings. The 2008 effective rate was favorably impacted by a lower tax rate related to the gain on the termination of the Reynolds Gallaher International Sarl joint venture, but was offset by unfavorability related to tax reserves and U.S. taxes recorded on foreign earnings. The effective tax rates exceeded the federal statutory rate of 35% primarily due to the impact of state taxes and certain non deductible items, offset by the domestic production activities deduction of the American Jobs Creation Act, enacted on October 22, 2004. 42 Table of Contents Liquidity and Financial Condition Liquidity At present, the principal sources of liquidity for RAIs operating subsidiaries businesses and operating needs are internally generated funds from their operations and intercompany loans and advances, mainly from RAI and RJR. The principal capital resources and sources of liquidity for RAI and RJR, in turn, are proceeds from issuances of debt securities by RAI and RJR and the RAI credit facility described below under Borrowing Arrangements. Cash flows from operating activities are believed to be sufficient for the foreseeable future to enable the operating subsidiaries to meet their obligations under the State Settlement Agreements, to fund their capital expenditures and to make payments to RAI and RJR that, when combined with RAIs and RJRs cash balances, will enable RAI and RJR to make their required debt service payments, and enable RAI to pay dividends to its shareholders. The negative impact, if any, on the sources of liquidity that could result from a decrease in demand for products due to short term inventory adjustments by wholesale and retail distributors, changes in competitive pricing, accelerated declines in consumption, particularly from increases in regulation or excise taxes, or adverse impacts from financial markets, cannot be predicted. RAI cannot predict its cash requirements or those of its subsidiaries related to any future settlements or judgments, including cash required to be held in escrow or to bond any appeals, if necessary, and RAI makes no assurance that it or its subsidiaries will be able to meet all of those requirements. RAI evaluated the liquidity of key suppliers and significant customers throughout 2010. Where there were liquidity concerns identified with key suppliers, contingency plans were developed. To date, no business interruptions have occurred caused by key supplier liquidity. No liquidity issues were identified regarding significant customers. As of December 31, 2010, RAI held investments primarily in auction rate securities, a mortgage backed security and a marketable equity security. Adverse changes in financial markets caused the auction rate securities and the mortgage backed security to revalue lower than carrying value and become less liquid. The auction rate securities and the mortgage backed security will not become liquid until a successful auction occurs or a buyer is found. RAI intends, and has the ability, to hold these auction rate securities and the mortgage backed security for a period of time sufficient to allow for sale, redemption or anticipated recovery in fair value. On January 13, 2011, RAI reached an agreement to sell all the capital stock of Lane and certain other assets related to the Lane operations, to an affiliate of Scandinavian Tobacco Group A/S for approximately $200 million in cash. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2011, pending antitrust review and approval. Contractual obligations as of December 31, 2010 were as follows: Payments Due by Period Less than 1 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Total Year 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Long term notes, exclusive of interest(1) $ 3,910 $ 400 $ 1,135 $ 200 $ 2,175 Interest payments related to long term notes(1) 1,669 212 367 277 813 Operating leases(2) 60 17 28 14 1 Non qualified pension obligations(3) 89 18 16 15 40 Postretirement benefit obligations(3) 751 70 153 155 373 Qualified pension funding(3) 300 300 Purchase obligations(4) 710 286 263 161 Other noncurrent liabilities(5) 53 N/A 28 5 20 State Settlement Agreements obligations(6) 12,500 2,500 5,000 5,000 Gross unrecognized tax benefit(7) 127 Federal tobacco buyout obligations(8) 880 230 460 190 Total cash obligations $ 21,049 $ 4,033 $ 7,450 $ 6,017 $ 3,422 43 Table of Contents (1) For more information about RAIs and RJRs long term notes, see Item 8, note 13 to consolidated financial statements. (2) Operating lease obligations represent estimated lease payments primarily related to office space, automobiles, warehouse space and computer equipment. See Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements for additional information. (3) For more information about RAIs pension plans and postretirement benefits, see Item 8, note 17 to consolidated financial statements. Non qualified pension and postretirement benefit obligations captioned under Thereafter include obligations during the next five years only. These obligations are not reasonably estimable beyond ten years. Qualified pension plan funding is based on the Pension Protection Act and tax deductibility and is not reasonably estimable beyond one year. (4) Purchase obligations primarily include commitments to acquire tobacco leaf. Purchase orders for the purchase of other raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table. RAIs operating subsidiaries are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations, as purchase orders typically represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements. For purposes of this table, contractual obligations for the purchase of goods or services are defined by RAIs operating subsidiaries as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase orders of RAIs operating subsidiaries are based on current demand expectations and are fulfilled by vendors within short time horizons. RAIs operating subsidiaries do not have significant non cancelable agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods or services specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed their expected requirements. RAIs operating subsidiaries also enter into contracts for outsourced services; however, the obligations under these contracts were generally not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for the cancellation without significant penalty. (5) Other noncurrent liabilities include primarily restructuring and bonus compensation. Certain other noncurrent liabilities are excluded from the table above, for which timing of payments are not estimable. (6) State Settlement Agreements obligation amounts in the aggregate beyond five years are not presented as these are obligations into perpetuity. For more information about the State Settlement Agreements, see Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. (7) For more information on gross unrecognized tax benefits, see Item 8, note 11 to consolidated financial statements. Due to inherent uncertainties regarding the timing of payment of these amounts, RAI cannot reasonably estimate the payment period. (8) For more information about the tobacco buyout legislation, see Governmental Activity below and Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Commitments as of December 31, 2010 were as follows: Commitment Expiration Period Less than Total 1 Year Standby letters of credit backed by revolving credit facility $ 9 $ 9 Total commitments $ 9 $ 9 Cash Flows 2010 Compared with 2009 Net cash flows from operating activities were $1,265 million and decreased $189 million in 2010, compared with 2009. This change was driven primarily by higher pension contributions and the payment of the full MSA obligation, partially offset by higher pricing, reduced inventories in 2010, lower excise tax payments on deployed inventory and lower income tax payments. 44 Table of Contents Net cash flows used in investing activities were $126 million and increased $3 million in 2010, compared with 2009 due to higher capital expenditures for American Snuff facility expansion projects and fewer proceeds from short term investments and the sale of fixed assets in 2010, partially offset by higher proceeds on long term investments in 2010 and the acquisition of Niconovum AB in 2009. Net cash flows used in financing activities were $1,349 million and increased $157 million in 2010, compared with the prior year period. This increase was the result of a higher debt payment in 2010 as well as higher dividends paid on common stock in 2010 as a result of the increase in the dividend per share amount. Net cash flows related to discontinued operations, net of tax benefit, include payments made in 2010, of $324 million, offset by tax benefits of $91 million, realized in 2010, and of $74 million to certain Canadian governments, resulting from the terms of a Comprehensive Agreement and plea agreement, respectively, associated with the former international businesses that were sold to JTI in 1999. See Item 8, notes 7 and 14 to consolidated financial statements for additional details of these payments. 2009 Compared with 2008 Net cash flows from operating activities were $1,454 million and increased $139 million in 2009, compared with 2008. This change was driven by the partial retention of the 2009 MSA payment and lower taxes paid, partially offset by higher pension payments, higher bonds posted and lower interest received in 2009. Net cash flows used in investing activities were $123 million in 2009, compared with net cash flows from investing activities of $278 million for the prior year. This change was primarily driven by lower proceeds from short term investments as well as higher capital expenditures and an acquisition in 2009 compared with the 2008 proceeds from the termination of the joint venture. Net cash flows used in financing activities were $1,192 million and decreased $14 million in 2009, compared with 2008. Lower common stock purchases in 2009 were nearly offset by long term debt repaid in 2009. Borrowing Arrangements As of December 31, 2010, RAIs total consolidated debt consisted of RAI notes in the aggregate principal amount of $3.8 billion, with maturity dates ranging from 2011 to 2037, and RJR notes in the aggregate principal amount of $118 million, with maturity dates ranging from 2012 to 2015. See Item 8, note 13 to consolidated financial statements for more information on these notes. RAI and RJR use interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on a portion of their debt obligations. In 2008, interest rate swaps existed on $1.6 billion of fixed rate notes. When entered into, these swaps were designated as hedges of underlying exposures. In 2009, RAI and RJR entered into offsetting interest rate swap agreements in the notional amount of $1.5 billion with maturity dates ranging from June 1, 2012 to June 15, 2017. These swaps were entered into with the same financial institution that holds a notional amount of $1.5 billion of current swaps and have a legal right of offset. The future cash flows, established as a result of entering into the 2009 swaps, total $321 million, and will be amortized and effectively reduce net interest costs over the remaining life of the notes. Concurrent with entering the swap agreements on January 6, 2009, RAI de designated the current swaps as fair value hedges. On January 7, 2009, RAI and RJR terminated an interest rate swap agreement in the notional amount of $100 million with a maturity date of June 1, 2012. The resulting gain of approximately $12 million will be amortized to effectively reduce interest expense over the remaining life of the notes. As a result of these actions, RAI and RJR have effectively converted $1.6 billion of fixed rate notes swapped to a variable rate of interest, to a fixed rate of interest of approximately 4.0%. At their option, RAI and RJR, as applicable, may redeem any or all of their outstanding fixed rate notes, in whole or in part at any time, subject to the payment of a make whole premium. RAIs floating rate notes are redeemable at par on any interest payment date after December 15, 2008. 45 Table of Contents On June 28, 2007, RAI entered into a Fifth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, which, as subsequently amended, is referred to as the Credit Facility, and provides for a five year, $498 million revolving Credit Facility, which may be increased up to $848 million at the discretion of the lenders upon the request of RAI. Effective July 15, 2010, RAI entered into a third amendment to Credit Facility, which among other things, permits the refinancing of certain existing RAI and RJR notes within ten months after maturity. Lenders and their respective commitments in the Credit Facility, which are several, not joint, commitments, are listed below: Lender Commitment JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. $ 52.89 Citibank N.A 52.89 Morgan Stanley Bank 52.00 Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd. 52.00 General Electric Capital Corporation 52.00 AG First Farm Credit Bank 52.00 Goldman Sachs Bank USA 35.00 Wachovia Bank, National Association 35.00 The Bank of Nova Scotia 35.00 The Bank of New York 35.00 Farm Credit Services of Minnesota Valley, PCA DBA FCS Commercial Finance Group 20.00 City National Bank of New Jersey 14.22 Farm Credit Bank of Texas 10.00 $ 498.00 No borrowings were outstanding under the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2010. Excluding letters of credit, the remaining $489 million of the Credit Facility was available for borrowing. Certain of RAIs subsidiaries, including the Guarantors, have guaranteed RAIs obligations under the Credit Facility and under RAIs outstanding senior notes, referred to as the Notes. The collateral for the Credit Facility, Notes and related guarantees (which was released during 2008) will be reinstated if RAIs corporate credit rating issued by each of SP and Moodys is lowered to at least one level below the lowest rating level established as investment grade, or if RAIs corporate credit rating issued by either SP or Moodys is lowered to at least two levels below the lowest rating level established as investment grade. Concerns about, or lowering of, RAIs ratings by SP or Moodys could have an adverse impact on RAIs ability to access the debt markets and could increase borrowing costs. However, given the cash balances and operating performance of RAI and its subsidiaries, RAIs management believes that such concerns about, or lowering of, such ratings would not have a material adverse impact on RAIs cash flows. RAI, RJR and their affiliates were in compliance with all covenants and restrictions imposed by their indebtedness at December 31, 2010. See Item 8, note 12 to consolidated financial statements for additional information on the Credit Facility. Dividends On February 16, 2011, RAIs board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.53 per common share. The dividend will be paid on April 1, 2011, to shareholders of record as of March 10, 2011. On an annualized basis, the dividend rate is $2.12 per common share. On December 6, 2010, RAIs board of directors increased RAIs targeted dividend payout ratio to an aggregate amount that is approximately 80% of RAIs annual consolidated net income, an increase from the previous target of 75%. 46 Table of Contents Stock Repurchases During 2010, at a cost of $5 million, RAI purchased 185,257 shares that were forfeited with respect to tax liabilities associated with restricted stock vesting under its LTIP. Capital Expenditures RAIs operating subsidiaries recorded cash capital expenditures of $174 million, $141 million and $113 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Of the 2010 amount, $52 million related to RJR Tobacco and $104 million related to American Snuff. RJR Tobacco plans to spend $80 million to $90 million for capital expenditures during 2011, primarily on non discretionary business requirements including a new research and development facility, and American Snuff plans to spend $105 million to $115 million in 2011, primarily on non discretionary capacity projects for the Memphis, Tennessee and Clarksville, Tennessee facilities. Capital expenditures are funded primarily by cash flows from operations. RAIs operating subsidiaries capital expenditure programs are expected to continue at a level sufficient to support their strategic and operating needs. There were no material long term commitments for capital expenditures as of December 31, 2010. Retirement Benefits RAI assessed the asset allocation and investment strategy of its pension plans and will phase in appropriate changes to balance funded status, interest rate risk and asset returns. Once fully implemented, these changes will reduce the pension funds exposure to equities and increase exposure to fixed income. As a result of changes to the asset allocation and investment strategy, RAI lowered the expected long term return on pension assets, referred to as the ELTRA, to 8.25%, in 2009, from 8.74% and will further lower it to 7.75% in 2011. The ELTRA, asset allocation, current asset performance and the discount rate may impact the funded status of RAIs pension plans. As a result, to improve the funded status, RAI contributed $811 million to the pension assets in 2010 and pension expense decreased to $114 million. In 2011, RAI plans to contribute $318 million to the pension plans, and the pension expense is expected to be $109 million. Income Taxes At December 31, 2010, RAI had a net deferred tax asset of $428 million. RAI has determined that no valuation allowance is required to be recorded against this deferred tax asset as RAI believes it is more likely than not that all of the deferred tax asset will be realized. This determination is due largely to RAIs historical and projected reporting pretax earnings and taxable income. Litigation and Settlements As discussed in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements, RJR Tobacco, American Snuff Co. and their affiliates, including RAI, and indemnitees, including BW, have been named in a number of tobacco related legal actions, proceedings or claims seeking damages in amounts ranging into the hundreds of millions or even billions of dollars. Unfavorable judgments have been returned in a number of tobacco related cases and state enforcement actions. As of December 31, 2010, RJR Tobacco had paid approximately $24 million since January 1, 2008, related to unfavorable judgments. In addition, RJR Tobacco is a defendant in the Louisiana state court class action, Scott v. American Tobacco Co., a case in which a court of appeals in 2010, entered an amended judgment, holding the defendants jointly and severally liable for funding the cost of a court supervised smoking cessation program, and ordered the defendants to deposit roughly $242 million plus interest into a trust to fund the program. The Scott decision has been stayed pending a disposition of the defendants petition for writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court, but if the ultimate outcome in Scott is adverse to RJR Tobacco, the case could have an adverse impact on RAIs financial condition and results of operations. RAIs management continues to conclude that the loss of any particular smoking and health tobacco litigation claim against RJR Tobacco or its affiliates or indemnitees, or the loss of any particular claim concerning the use of smokeless tobacco against American Snuff Co., when viewed on an individual basis, is not probable. RAI and its 47 Table of Contents subsidiaries believe that they have valid bases for appeal of adverse verdicts against them and have valid defenses to all actions and intend to defend all actions vigorously. Nonetheless, the possibility of material losses related to tobacco litigation is more than remote. Litigation is subject to many uncertainties, and generally it is not possible to predict the outcome of the litigation pending against RJR Tobacco, American Snuff Co. or their affiliates or indemnitees, or to reasonably estimate the amount or range of any possible loss. Moreover, notwithstanding the quality of defenses available to it and its affiliates in tobacco related litigation matters, it is possible that RAIs consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position could be materially adversely affected by the ultimate outcome of certain pending or future litigation matters. In November 1998, RJR Tobacco, BW and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers entered into the MSA with attorneys general representing most U.S. states, territories and possessions. As described in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements, the State Settlement Agreements impose a perpetual stream of future payment obligations on RJR Tobacco and the other major U.S. cigarette manufacturers and place significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell cigarettes in the future. For more information related to historical and expected settlement expenses and payments under the State Settlement Agreements, see Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry Health Care Cost Recovery Cases State Settlement Agreements in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. The State Settlement Agreements have materially adversely affected RJR Tobaccos shipment volumes. RAI believes that these settlement obligations may materially adversely affect the results of operations, cash flows or financial position of RAI and RJR Tobacco in future periods. The degree of the adverse impact will depend, among other things, on the rate of decline in U.S. cigarette sales in the premium and value categories, RJR Tobaccos share of the domestic premium and value cigarette categories, and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to the State Settlement Agreements. RJR Tobacco and certain of the other participating manufacturers under the State Settlement Agreements are currently involved in litigation with the settling states with respect to the availability for certain market years of a downward adjustment to the annual State Settlement Agreements payment obligation, known as the NPM Adjustment. Pending the resolution of these disputes, RJR Tobacco and certain of the other participating manufacturers have placed the disputed portions of their 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2010 annual payments into the MSA disputed funds account. In February 2009, approximately $431 million was released, without waiving claim, to the settling states. Accordingly, RJR Tobacco had approximately $2.0 billion deposited in the MSA disputed funds account as of December 31, 2010. In April 2009, RJR Tobacco retained approximately $406.5 million of its 2009 MSA payment to reflect its share of the 2006 NPM Adjustment as calculated by the independent auditor. For more information related to this litigation, see Litigation Affecting the Cigarette Industry State Settlement Agreements Enforcement and Validity; Adjustments Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Governmental Activity The marketing, sale, taxation and use of tobacco products have been subject to substantial regulation by government and health officials for many years. It is unlikely that in 2011, the U.S. Congress will consider the adoption of further tobacco related legislation. Various state governments have adopted or are considering, among other things, legislation and regulations that would: significantly increase their taxes on tobacco products; restrict displays, advertising and sampling of tobacco products; raise the minimum age to possess or purchase tobacco products; restrict or ban the use of menthol in cigarettes or prohibit mint or wintergreen as a flavor in smokeless tobacco products; require the disclosure of ingredients used in the manufacture of tobacco products; require the disclosure of nicotine yield information for cigarettes; impose restrictions on smoking in public and private areas; and 48 Table of Contents restrict the sale of tobacco products directly to consumers or other unlicensed recipients, including over the Internet. Together with manufacturers price increases in recent years and substantial increases in state and federal taxes on tobacco products, these developments have had and will likely continue to have an adverse effect on the sale of tobacco products. Cigarettes and other tobacco products are subject to substantial taxes in the United States. On February 4, 2009, President Obama signed into law, effective April 1, 2009, an increase of $0.62 in the excise tax per pack of cigarettes, and significant tax increases on other tobacco products, to fund expansion of the State Childrens Health Insurance Program. Under these federal tax increases: the federal excise tax per pack of 20 cigarettes increased to $1.01; the federal excise tax rate for chewing tobacco increased $0.3083 per pound to $0.5033 per pound, and for snuff increased $0.925 per pound to $1.51 per pound; All states and the District of Columbia currently impose cigarette excise taxes at levels ranging from $0.17 per pack in Missouri to $4.35 per pack in New York. As of December 31, 2010, the weighted average state cigarette excise tax per pack, calculated on a 12 month rolling average basis, was approximately $1.24, compared with the 12 month rolling average of $1.16 as of December 31, 2009. During 2010, six states passed cigarette excise tax increases, and a number of other states are considering an increase in their cigarette excise taxes for 2011. Certain city and county governments, such as New York and Chicago, also impose substantial excise taxes on cigarettes sold in those jurisdictions. Forty nine states and the District of Columbia also subject smokeless tobacco to excise taxes, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, the singular exception, considered, but did not adopt, such a tax during its 2010 legislative session. As of December 31, 2010, 30 states taxed moist snuff on an ad valorem basis, at rates ranging from 5% in South Carolina to 100% in Wisconsin. As of December 31, 2010, 17 states had weight based taxes on moist snuff, ranging from $0.02 for cans weighing between 5/8 of an ounce and 15/8 ounces in Alabama to $2.02 per ounce in Maine. At the end of 2010, two states imposed a unit tax on moist snuff: Kentucky with a tax of $0.19 per unit, and Washington, with a tax of $2.526 per unit for units weighing 1.02 ounces or less and a proportionate amount above that weight. Legislation to convert from an ad valorem to a weight based tax on moist snuff was introduced in several states in 2010. During 2010, six states passed tax increases on smokeless tobacco products, and a number of other states are considering the adoption in 2011 of an increase in their taxes on smokeless tobacco products. On March 31, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Prevent All Cigarette Trafficking Act. This legislation, among other things, restricts the sale of tobacco products directly to consumers or unlicensed recipients, including over the Internet, through expanded reporting requirements, requirements for delivery, sales and penalties. It is not anticipated that this legislation will have a material adverse effect on the sale of tobacco products by RAIs operating companies. In 1964, the Report of the Advisory Committee to the Surgeon General of the U.S. Public Health Service concluded that cigarette smoking was a health hazard of sufficient importance to warrant appropriate remedial action. Since 1966, federal law has required a warning statement on cigarette packaging, and cigarette advertising in other media also is required to contain a warning statement. Since 1971, television and radio advertising of cigarettes has been prohibited in the United States. The warnings currently required on cigarette packages and advertisements are: SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Smoking Causes Lung Cancer, Heart Disease, Emphysema, And May Complicate Pregnancy; SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Quitting Smoking Now Greatly Reduces Serious Risks to Your Health; SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Smoking By Pregnant Women May Result in Fetal Injury, Premature Birth, And Low Birth Weight; and SURGEON GENERALS WARNING: Cigarette Smoke Contains Carbon Monoxide. 49 Table of Contents As noted below, the FDA has proposed regulations that would revise the foregoing warnings. Since the initial report in 1964, the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, now the Secretary of Health and Human Services, and the Surgeon General have issued a number of other reports which purport to find the nicotine in cigarettes addictive and to link cigarette smoking and exposure to cigarette smoke with certain health hazards, including various types of cancer, coronary heart disease and chronic obstructive lung disease. These reports have recommended various governmental measures to reduce the incidence of smoking. In 1992, the federal Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Act was signed into law. This act required states to adopt a minimum age of 18 for purchase of tobacco products and to establish a system to monitor, report and reduce the illegal sale of tobacco products to minors in order to continue receiving federal funding for mental health and drug abuse programs. In 1996, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services announced regulations implementing this legislation. And in 2006, the Surgeon General released a report entitled The Health Consequences of Involuntary Exposure to Tobacco Smoke. Among its conclusions, the report found the following: exposure of adults to secondhand smoke causes coronary heart disease and lung cancer, exposure of children to secondhand smoke results in an increased risk of sudden infant death syndrome, acute respiratory infections, ear problems and more severe asthma; and that there is no risk free level of exposure to secondhand smoke. In 1986, Congress enacted the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act of 1986, which, among other things, required health warning notices on smokeless tobacco packages and advertising and prohibited the advertising of smokeless tobacco products on any medium of electronic communications subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications Commission. In 2009, the FDA Tobacco Act (discussed below) amended the Comprehensive Smokeless Tobacco Health Education Act to require the following warnings on smokeless tobacco packaging and advertising, displayed randomly and as equally as possible in each 12 month period: WARNING: THIS PRODUCT CAN CAUSE MOUTH CANCER; WARNING: THIS PRODUCT CAN CAUSE GUM DISEASE AND TOOTH LOSS; WARNING: THIS PRODUCT IS NOT A SAFE ALTERNATIVE TO CIGARETTES; and WARNING: SMOKELESS TOBACCO IS ADDICTIVE. On June 22, 2009, President Obama signed into law the FDA Tobacco Act, which grants the FDA broad authority over the manufacture, sale, marketing and packaging of tobacco products. The following provisions of the FDA Tobacco Act took effect upon passage: no charitable distribution of tobacco products; prohibitions on statements that would lead consumers to believe that a tobacco product is approved, endorsed, or deemed safe by the FDA; pre market approval by the FDA for claims made with respect to reduced risk or reduced exposure products; and prohibition on the marketing of tobacco products in conjunction with any other class of product regulated by the FDA. In addition, pursuant to the FDA Tobacco Act: as of September 20, 2009, tobacco manufacturers were banned from selling cigarettes with characterizing flavors (other than menthol, which under the FDA Tobacco Act is specifically exempt as a characterizing flavor, but the impact of which on public health will be studied as discussed below); on February 28, 2010, all manufacturers registered with the FDA their domestic manufacturing facilities as well as all cigarette and smokeless tobacco products sold in the United States; on March 18, 2010, the FDA reissued regulations addressing advertising and marketing restrictions that were originally promulgated in 1996; 50 Table of Contents as of April 30, 2010, manufacturers were required to produce health related documents generated from and after June 22, 2009 through December 31, 2009 (the FDA has interpreted the FDA Tobacco Act as establishing an ongoing requirement to submit health related documents; however, the FDA has not yet established a timetable for further production); as of June 22, 2010, manufacturers were required to make by brand ingredient submissions, place different and larger warnings on packaging and advertising for smokeless tobacco products and eliminate the use of descriptors on tobacco products, such as low tar and lights; and on November 12, 2010, the FDA issued a proposed regulation for the imposition of larger, graphic health warnings on cigarette packaging and advertising to take effect September 22, 2012. On a going forward basis, various provisions under the FDA Tobacco Act and regulations to be issued under the FDA Tobacco Act will become effective and will: require manufacturers to report harmful constituents; require manufacturers to obtain FDA clearance for cigarette and smokeless tobacco products commercially launched or to be launched after February 15, 2007; require manufacturers to test ingredients and constituents identified by the FDA and disclose this information to the public; prohibit use of tobacco containing a pesticide chemical residue at a level greater than allowed under Federal law; establish good manufacturing practices to be followed at tobacco manufacturing facilities; authorize the FDA to place more severe restrictions on the advertising, marketing and sale of tobacco products; permit inconsistent state regulation of labeling and advertising and eliminate the existing federal preemption of such regulation; authorize the FDA to require the reduction of nicotine and the reduction or elimination of other constituents; and grant the FDA the regulatory authority to impose broad additional restrictions. The U.S. Congress did limit the FDAs authority in two areas, prohibiting it from: banning all tobacco products; and requiring the reduction of nicotine yields of a tobacco product to zero. A Center for Tobacco Products has been established within the FDA, funded through quarterly user fees that will be assessed against tobacco product manufacturers and importers based on market share. The total amount of user fees to be collected over the first ten years will be approximately $5.4 billion. The expense related to the FDA user fees of RAIs operating companies for 2011 will be approximately $120 million to $130 million. Within the Center, a Tobacco Products Scientific Advisory Committee, referred to as the TPSAC, was established on March 22, 2010, to provide advice, information and recommendations with respect to the safety, dependence or health issues related to tobacco products. The TPSAC is scheduled to meet quarterly to address matters brought to it by the Center as well as those required of it by the Act, including: a recommendation on modified risk applications; a recommendation as to whether there is a threshold level below which nicotine yields do not produce dependence; a report on the impact of the use of menthol in cigarettes on the public health; and a report on the impact of dissolvable tobacco products on the public health. 51 Table of Contents The TPSAC held meetings on four occasions during 2010, to discuss the impact on the use of menthol in cigarettes on the public health. A subcommittee of the TPSAC met on September 27, 2010, to discuss the drafting of a report on this topic that is expected to be issued by March 22, 2011. A subcommittee of the TPSAC also met in June and July, 2010, to discuss recommendations for the development of a list of harmful and potentially harmful tobacco constituents. At a meeting held in August 2010, the subcommittee provided to the full TPSAC its recommendations and a draft initial list of harmful and potentially harmful tobacco constituents, which the TPSAC adopted. The FDA has not yet taken action on these recommendations. In February 2010, RJR Tobacco received a letter from the Center for Tobacco Products (which letter is available on the FDAs web site) requesting, in connection with the TPSACs study of dissolvable tobacco products, certain information regarding the perception and use of CAMEL Dissolvables. RJR Tobacco, which markets its tobacco products only to adult tobacco users, responded to the FDAs information request on April 1, 2010. In May 2010, the Center for Tobacco Products sent letters to various tobacco manufacturers, including RJR Tobacco, Santa Fe, American Snuff Co. and Lane, containing a document request for certain information concerning the use of menthol in cigarettes. Each of these companies responded to the FDAs information request on August 26, 2010. On August 31, 2009, RJR Tobacco and American Snuff Co. joined other tobacco manufacturers and a tobacco retailer in filing a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky (Commonwealth Brands, Inc. v. United States of America), challenging certain provisions of the FDA Tobacco Act that severely restrict the few remaining channels available to communicate with adult tobacco consumers. RAI believes these provisions cannot be justified on any basis consistent with the demands of the First Amendment. The suit does not challenge the U.S. Congresss decision to give the FDA regulatory authority over tobacco products, nor does it challenge the vast majority of the provisions of the new law. For further information regarding this case, see Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. It is likely that the FDA Tobacco Act could result in a decrease in cigarette and smokeless tobacco sales in the United States, including sales of RJR Tobaccos and American Snuff Co.s brands, and an increase in costs to RJR Tobacco and American Snuff Co. that could have a material adverse effect on RAIs financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. RAI believes that such regulation may adversely affect the ability of its operating subsidiaries to compete against their larger competitor, which may be able to more quickly and cost effectively comply with these new rules and regulations. The FDA has yet to issue guidance with respect to many provisions of the FDA Tobacco Act, which may result in less efficient compliance efforts. Finally, the ability of RAIs operating companies to gain efficient market clearance for new tobacco products could be affected by FDA rules and regulations. Legislation imposing various restrictions on public smoking also has been enacted by 49 states and many local jurisdictions, and many employers have initiated programs restricting or eliminating smoking in the workplace. A number of states have enacted legislation designating a portion of increased cigarette excise taxes to fund either anti smoking programs, health care programs or cancer research. In addition, educational and research programs addressing health care issues related to smoking are being funded from industry payments made or to be made under settlements with state attorneys general. Federal law prohibits smoking in scheduled passenger aircraft, and the U.S. Interstate Commerce Commission has banned smoking on buses transporting passengers interstate. Certain common carriers have imposed additional restrictions on passenger smoking. As of December 31, 2010, all states and Washington, D.C. had enacted fire standards compliance legislation (the statute in Wyoming, the last state to adopt such a rule, becomes effective later in 2011), adopting the same testing standard first adopted by New York in 2003, a standard requiring cigarettes to achieve specified test results when placed on ten layers of filter paper in controlled laboratory conditions. The cigarettes that RAIs operating companies sell in these jurisdictions comply with this standard, with RJR Tobacco, in recognition of legislative trends and in an effort to increase productivity and reduce complexity, having voluntarily converted all of its brands to fire standard compliant paper by the end of 2009. In July 2007, the State of Maine became the first state to enact a statute that prohibits the sale of cigarettes and cigars that have a characterizing flavor. The legislation defines characterizing flavor as a distinguishable taste or aroma that is imparted to tobacco or tobacco smoke either prior to or during consumption, other than a taste or aroma from tobacco, menthol, clove, coffee, nuts or peppers. In October 2008, the State of New Jersey passed a 52 Table of Contents similar ban on flavored cigarettes with a similar definition of characterizing flavor but excluding only tobacco, menthol or clove. Additionally, New Jersey extended the ban not only to whether the product itself has a characterizing flavor as part of the aroma of the product or smoke, but also if the product was marketed or advertised as producing such a flavor, taste or aroma. During 2009, New York City passed legislation that bans characterizing flavors in tobacco products other than cigarettes beginning on February 25, 2010. An exemption applies if the characterizing flavor is tobacco, menthol, mint or wintergreen. The New York City rule is the subject of a pending federal court challenge by certain industry participants, on the basis that the local law is preempted by the FDA Tobacco Act and violates the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Similar bills banning characterizing flavors in tobacco products are pending in other states. A price differential exists between cigarettes manufactured for sale abroad and cigarettes manufactured for sale in the United States. Consequently, a domestic gray market has developed in cigarettes manufactured for sale abroad, but instead diverted for domestic sales that compete with cigarettes that RJR Tobacco manufactures for domestic sale. The U.S. federal government and all states, except Massachusetts, have enacted legislation prohibiting the sale and distribution of gray market cigarettes. In addition, RJR Tobacco has taken legal action against distributors and retailers who engage in such practices. RJR Tobacco expects to benefit from certain state legislative activity aimed at leveling the playing field between original participating manufacturers under the MSA and nonparticipating manufacturers under the MSA, referred to as NPMs. Forty six states have passed legislation to ensure NPMs are making required escrow payments. Under this legislation, a state would only permit distribution of brands by manufacturers who are deemed by the states to be MSA compliant. Failure to make escrow payments could result in the loss of an NPMs ability to sell tobacco products in a respective state. Additionally, 45 states have enacted legislation that closes a loophole in the MSA. The loophole allows NPMs that concentrate their sales in a single state, or a limited number of states, to recover most of the funds from their escrow accounts. To obtain the refunds, the manufacturers must establish that their escrow deposit was greater than the amount the state would have received had the manufacturer been a subsequent participating manufacturer under the MSA, that is, the states allocable share. The National Association of Attorneys General, referred to as NAAG, has endorsed adoption of the allocable share legislation needed to eliminate this loophole. Finally, four states, Alaska, Michigan, Minnesota and Utah, have enacted equity assessments on NPMs products. This legislative initiative has not been endorsed by NAAG. Forty two states by statute or court rule have limited, and several additional states are considering limiting, the amount of the bonds required to file an appeal of an adverse judgment in state court. The limitation on the amount of such bonds generally ranges from $1 million to $150 million. Bonding statutes in 37 states allow defendants that are subject to large adverse judgments, such as cigarette manufacturers, to reasonably bond such judgments and pursue the appellate process. In five other states and Puerto Rico, the filing of a notice of appeal automatically stays the judgment of the trial court. In 2003, the World Health Organization adopted a broad tobacco control treaty. The treaty recommends and requires enactment of legislation establishing specific actions to prevent youth smoking, restrict and gradually eliminate tobacco products marketing, provide greater regulation and disclosure of ingredients, increase the size and scope of package warning labels to cover at least 30% of each package and include graphic pictures on packages. The treaty entered into force on February 27, 2005 90 days after ratification by the 40th country. In February 2006, the first session of the Conference of the Parties, referred to as the COP, occurred. Since then, the COP has met several times and adopted guidelines with respect to various provisions of the tobacco control treaty. Although the U.S. delegate to the World Health Organization voted for the treaty in May 2003, and the Secretary for Health and Human Services signed the document in May 2004, the Bush Administration did not send the treaty to the U.S. Senate for ratification. Ratification by the United States could lead to broader regulation of the industry. It is not possible to determine what additional federal, state or local legislation or regulations relating to smoking or cigarettes will be enacted or to predict the effect of new legislation or regulations on RJR Tobacco or the cigarette industry in general, but any new legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on RJR Tobacco or the cigarette industry in general. Similarly, it is not possible to determine what additional federal, state or local 53 Table of Contents legislation or regulations relating to smokeless tobacco products will be enacted or to predict the effect of new regulation on American Snuff Co. or smokeless tobacco products in general, but any new legislation or regulations could have an adverse effect on American Snuff Co. or smokeless tobacco products in general. Tobacco Buyout Legislation For information relating to tobacco buyout legislation, see Tobacco Buyout Legislation and Related Litigation in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Other Contingencies For information relating to other contingencies of RAI, RJR, RJR Tobacco and American Snuff Co., see Other Contingencies in Item 8, note 14 to consolidated financial statements. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements RAI has no off balance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future material effect on its financial position, results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources. Cautionary Information Regarding Forward Looking Statements Statements included in this report that are not historical in nature are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements regarding future events or the future performance or results of RAI and its subsidiaries inherently are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements. These risks and uncertainties include: the substantial and increasing taxation and regulation of tobacco products, including the 2009 federal excise tax increases, and the regulation of tobacco products by the FDA; the possibility that the FDA will issue a regulation prohibiting menthol as a flavor in cigarettes or prohibit mint or wintergreen as a flavor in smokeless tobacco products; decreased sales resulting from the future issuance of corrective communications, required by the order in the U.S. Department of Justice case on five subjects, including smoking and health addiction; various legal actions, proceedings and claims relating to the sale, distribution, manufacture, development, advertising, marketing and claimed health effects of tobacco products that are pending or may be instituted against RAI or its subsidiaries; the potential difficulty of obtaining bonds as a result of litigation outcomes and the challenges to the Florida bond statute applicable to the Engle Progeny cases; the substantial payment obligations with respect to cigarette sales, and the substantial limitations on the advertising and marketing of cigarettes and RJR Tobaccos smoke free tobacco products under the State Settlement Agreements; the continuing decline in volume in the U.S. cigarette industry and RAIs dependence on the U.S. cigarette industry; concentration of a material amount of sales with a single customer or distributor; competition from other manufacturers, including industry consolidations or any new entrants in the marketplace; increased promotional activities by competitors, including deep discount cigarette brands; the success or failure of new product innovations and acquisitions; the responsiveness of both the trade and consumers to new products, marketing strategies and promotional programs; 54 Table of Contents the ability to achieve efficiencies in the businesses of RAIs operating companies, including outsourcing functions and expansion of RJR Tobaccos field trade marketing organization, without negatively affecting financial or operating results; the reliance on a limited number of suppliers for certain raw materials; the cost of tobacco leaf and other raw materials and other commodities used in products; the effect of market conditions on interest rate risk, foreign currency exchange rate risk and the return on corporate cash; changes in the financial position or strength of lenders participating in RAIs credit facility; the impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets, including trademarks; the effect of market conditions on the performance of pension assets or any adverse effects of any new legislation or regulations changing pension expense accounting or required pension funding levels; the substantial amount of RAI debt; the credit rating of RAI and its securities; any restrictive covenants imposed under RAIs debt agreements; the possibility of fire, violent weather and other disasters that may adversely affect manufacturing and other facilities; the significant ownership interest of BW, RAIs largest shareholder, in RAI and the rights of BW under the governance agreement between the companies; and the expiration of the standstill provisions of the governance agreement. Due to these uncertainties and risks, you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on these forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Except as provided by federal securities laws, RAI is not required to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk Market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact the consolidated results of operations, cash flows and financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates. RAI and its subsidiaries are exposed to interest rate risk directly related to their normal investing and funding activities. In addition, RAI and its subsidiaries have immaterial exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk related primarily to purchases and foreign operations denominated in euros, British pounds, Swiss francs, Swedish krona, Chinese renminbi and Japanese yen. RAI and its subsidiaries have established policies and procedures to manage their exposure to market risks and use major institutions as counterparties to minimize their investment and credit risk. Frequently, these institutions are also members of the bank group that provide RAI credit, and management believes this further minimizes the risk of nonperformance. Derivative financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes. 55 Table of Contents The table below provides information about RAIs financial instruments, as of December 31, 2010, that are sensitive to changes in interest rates.
