ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table highlights Rowans operating results for the years indicated (in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Revenues: Drilling $ 775.4 $ 472.1 $ 392.2 Manufacturing 293.4 207.6 137.1 Total $ 1,068.8 $ 679.7 $ 529.3 Operating income: Drilling $ 332.9 $ 51.7 $ 7.0 Manufacturing 7.7 6.8 2.2 Total $ 340.6 $ 58.5 $ 9.2 Income (loss) from continuing operations $ 217.8 $ 27.5 $ (3.3 ) Income (loss) from discontinued operations $ 12.0 $ (28.8 ) $ (4.5 ) Net income (loss) $ 229.8 $ (1.3 ) $ (7.8 ) As indicated in the preceding table, Rowans results of operations are heavily dependent upon the performance of our drilling division, which comprises about 94% of our fixed assets and, over the past three years, has generated 73% of our aggregate revenues and 96% of our aggregate operating income. Our manufacturing division has strategically led the expansion and upgrade of our drilling fleet and, in recent years, has improved its contribution to our operating results. The performance of each of our continuing operations over the 2003 2005 period is discussed more fully below. On December 31, 2004, we completed the sale of our aviation operations. In February 2005, we sold our options to purchase four larger anchor handling boats and, in May 2005, leases covering our remaining boats expired and we exited the marine vessel business. The amounts shown in the table above for Income (loss) from discontinued operations reflect the aggregate after tax results of our aviation and boat operations for each of the past three years, and include a $13.1 million after tax gain recognized on the sale of our boat purchase options in 2005 and a $16.0 million after tax loss recognized on the sale of our aviation operations in 2004. Drilling Operations Rowans drilling operating results are a function of rig activity and day rates in our principal operating areas, which have historically been offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and eastern Canada and onshore in Texas and Louisiana. We are selective in pursuing work in other overseas markets where our harsh environment jack up rigs are well suited, and seek opportunities to maximize long term returns. Rig activity and day rates are primarily determined by energy company exploration and development expenditures, which are heavily influenced by oil and natural gas prices, and the availability of competitive equipment. Day rates generally follow the trend in rig activity and, due to intense competition in the contract drilling industry, both have historically declined much faster than they have risen. Rowans rig fleet consists of 20 offshore jack up rigs and 17 actively marketed land rigs. Our offshore fleet features three Gorilla class jack ups built during the early 1980s, four Super Gorilla class jack ups constructed during the 1998 2003 period, and two Tarzan Class jack ups delivered in 2004 and 2005. Our land fleet includes four rigs constructed during 2001 2002 and eleven rigs that have been substantially rebuilt in recent years. For the past several years, our offshore drilling operations have been focused in the Gulf of Mexico, where 13 of our offshore rigs are currently deployed. This market is extremely fragmented among many oil and gas 22 Table of Contents companies, most of whom are independent operators whose drilling activities are often highly dependent upon near term operating cash flows. A typical drilling assignment may call for 30 60 days of exploration or development work, performed under a single well contract with negotiable renewal options. Long term contracts have been rare, and generally are available only from the major integrated oil companies and a few of the larger independent operators. Thus, drilling activity and day rates in this market have tended to fluctuate rather quickly, and generally follow trends in natural gas prices. Rowan has historically avoided long term commitments unless they provided opportunities for rate adjustments in the future. As discussed more fully below, high natural gas prices and the continued migration of rigs to foreign markets in recent years, coupled with the significant loss of equipment in 2005 due to hurricanes, have created a jack up supply deficit in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, rig day rates have increased dramatically over the past several months to record levels and term drilling contracts are becoming more prevalent. Thus, Rowan is currently more receptive to longer term commitments than in the past. The North Sea is a mature offshore drilling market that has long been dominated by major oil and gas companies operating within a relatively tight regulatory environment. Drilling assignments can range from several months to several years, and project lead times are often lengthy. Thus, drilling activity and day rates in the North Sea move slowly in response to market conditions, and generally follow trends in oil prices. Following a two year absence, we returned to the North Sea with the newbuild Gorilla VII in early 2002, and added Gorilla V to that market in late 2004. We recently extended the Gorilla VII commitment into the third quarter of 2007. We have operated offshore eastern Canada to varying degrees since the early 1980s, and our presence there peaked at three fully utilized rigs in mid 2000. More recently, demand for harsh environment jack ups offshore eastern Canada has been sporadic. We returned to that market with the Gorilla VI during the second quarter of 2005 and recently committed the rig for work there through November 2006. In August 2005, we obtained a three year contract from Saudi Aramco for four jack up rigs offshore Saudi Arabia, our first drilling assignment in the Middle East in 25 years. The Rowan Middletown, Charles Rowan, Arch Rowan and Rowan California departed the Gulf of Mexico in January 2006 and are expected to be working in the Persian Gulf in April. Rowan does not cold stack its drilling rigs during slack periods as we believe the long term costs of retraining personnel and restarting equipment negates any short term savings. Thus, our drilling expenses do not typically fluctuate with rig activity, though they have increased as our rig fleets have been expanded. Rig fleet additions in recent years have included the second Tarzan Class jack up Bob Keller delivered in August 2005, the first Tarzan Class jack up Scooter Yeargain delivered in April 2004, the Super Gorilla XL class jack up Bob Palmer delivered in August 2003 and four existing land rigs that were substantially rebuilt during 2005 (two rigs) and 2003 (two rigs). 2005 Compared to 2004 The following table highlights the performance of our drilling division during 2005 compared to 2004 (dollars in millions): 2005 2004 %increase Revenues $ 775.4 $ 472.1 64 % Operating income 332.9 51.7 544 % Operating income as a % of revenues 43 % 11 % Drilling revenues increased by $303.3 million in 2005, due primarily to the effects of increased average day rates, as follows (in millions): Increase in drilling activity, including additional rigs $ 48.7 Increase in average day rates 254.6 Our overall offshore fleet utilization was 96% in 2005, up from 92% in 2004. Our average offshore day rate was $78,100 in 2005, an increase of approximately 60% over 2004. We compute rig utilization as revenue 23 Table of Contents producing days divided by total available rig days. Average day rates are determined as recorded revenues, excluding rebilled expenses, divided by revenue producing days. Natural gas prices were at historically high levels in early 2005, and increased further during the year primarily due to declining domestic production and growing demand. Prices went even higher following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, as significant gas production from the Gulf of Mexico was shut in due to damaged platforms and pipelines. These storms also removed eight units from the competitive jack up fleet, including four of our rigs. Another six rigs migrated to foreign markets during the year. As a result, we were able to consistently increase our Gulf of Mexico day rates during 2005. The following table summarizes average natural gas prices and our Gulf of Mexico fleet utilization and average day rates during the year: Natural Average Average Gas (MCF)* Utilization Day Rate First quarter $ 6.50 98 % $ 58,000 Second quarter 6.95 97 % 66,500 Third quarter 9.73 99 % 74,400 Fourth quarter 12.88 94 % 92,100 Full year 9.02 97 % 71,100 Prior year 6.18 92 % 45,200 * Source: New York Mercantile Exchange As shown in the preceding table, our average Gulf of Mexico day rate increased by 57% in 2005. Our Gulf of Mexico fleet declined to 17 units during the year as four rigs were lost during the hurricanes, two rigs were sold and one rig was relocated to eastern Canada. Our second Tarzan Class jack up, the Bob Keller, was delivered in August and commenced operations in September. Another rig was severely damaged during Hurricane Katrina and should return to service in 2006. As a result, our total revenue producing days in the Gulf of Mexico decreased by 221 or 3% during 2005. Four of our rigs departed the area in early 2006 for work in Saudi Arabia. Oil prices reached new heights during 2005, peaking at just below $70 per barrel, and ended the year at around $65. Thus, rig demand remained strong in most foreign markets, which contributed to the further migration of jack ups from the Gulf of Mexico. Market conditions in our principal foreign areas, the North Sea and offshore eastern Canada, improved during the year, enabling Rowan to secure more profitable drilling assignments. Gorilla V was 94% utilized in the North Sea in 2005, and generated more than $160,000 per day in drilling revenues during the year. The Gorilla VII simultaneous drilling/production assignment in the United Kingdom sector ended during the second quarter of 2005 and the rig was relocated to Denmark during the third quarter. Gorilla VII was 94% utilized in the area and averaged more than $175,000 per day in revenues thereafter. Gorilla VI was relocated from the Gulf of Mexico to offshore eastern Canada during the second quarter of 2005, where the rig was 82% utilized and generated almost $160,000 per day in revenues during the remainder of the year. Rowans 17 actively marketed deep well land rigs were 98% utilized in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma in 2005, and achieved an average day rate of $18,400 during the year, compared to 97% and $12,200 in 2004. The fleet includes one rig, idle since 2002, that was substantially rebuilt during the year and returned to service in late December 2005. Twelve new 2000 horsepower land rigs are at varying stages of construction and should be delivered by the end of 2006. Ten of these new rigs have been contracted for terms ranging from two to three years. 24 Table of Contents Drilling operating costs increased by $67.9 million or 21% in 2005 compared to 2004, due primarily to effects of the following (in millions): Rebillable expenses primarily towing costs $ 17.5 Wage increases 14.5 Rig maintenance 13.2 New rigs primarily Scooter Yeargain (May 2004) and Bob Keller (September 2005) 11.5 UK drilling/production assignment field abandonment costs 4.5 Incentive compensation and retirement plan costs 3.6 Selling, general and administrative costs increased by 18.3 million or 68% in 2005, due primarily to higher professional services fees associated with Sarbanes Oxley Act compliance and incremental incentive compensation costs. Depreciation and amortization increased by $0.8 million or 1% in 2005, due primarily to the addition of the rigs shown above. Drilling operating income in 2005 included $52.8 million of gains on asset disposals during the year, $39.1 million of which was recognized on the sale of our 32 year old jack up Rowan Texas during the third quarter. Another $13.9 million of operating income reflects the net of insurance proceeds received over the carrying values of our four jack up rigs that were lost during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and related uninsured salvage costs. 2004 Compared to 2003 The following table highlights the performance of our drilling division during 2004 compared to 2003 (dollars in millions): 2004 2003 %increase Revenues $ 472.1 $ 392.2 20 % Operating income 51.7 7.0 639 % Operating income as a % of revenues 11 % 2 % Drilling revenues increased by $79.9 million in 2004, due to the effects of increases in both drilling activity and average day rates, as follows (in millions): Increase in drilling activity, including additional rigs $ 51.9 Increase in average day rates 28.0 Our overall offshore fleet utilization was 92% in 2004, up from 89% in 2003. Our average offshore day rate was $48,900 in 2004, an increase of approximately 12% over 2003. We consider only revenue producing days in computing rig utilization and average day rates. Natural gas prices remained fairly stable at well above $5.00 per mcf throughout 2004, due largely to constrained supply coupled with growing demand. At the same time, the size of the competitive Gulf of Mexico jack up fleet again declined during the year as rigs continued to be attracted to foreign markets. Following the unexpected cancellation of projects for three Gorilla class jack ups in the first quarter, overall demand for our Gulf of Mexico rigs improved throughout the remainder of 2004, which enabled Rowan to consistently increase average day rates in the area. The following table summarizes average natural gas prices and our Gulf of Mexico fleet utilization and average day rates during 2004: Natural Average Average Gas (MCF)* Utilization Day Rate First quarter $ 5.71 82 % $ 39,700 Second quarter 6.16 88 % 42,200 Third quarter 5.58 97 % 46,500 Fourth quarter 7.29 100 % 50,600 Full year 6.18 92 % 45,200 Prior year 5.49 92 % 38,100 25 Table of Contents * Source: New York Mercantile Exchange As shown in the preceding table, our average Gulf of Mexico day rate increased by 19% in 2004. Our Gulf of Mexico fleet increased to 23 units in May 2004 with the commencement of operations by the Scooter Yeargain. As a result, our total revenue producing days in the Gulf of Mexico increased by 462 or 6% during 2004. Oil prices rose significantly during 2004, to a peak of more than $50 per barrel, which helped sustain strong rig demand in many foreign markets and influenced the continued migration of many jack ups from the Gulf of Mexico. However, market conditions in our principal foreign areas, the North Sea and offshore eastern Canada, did not improve measurably during the year. Rowans drilling operating results for the first nine months of 2004 were considerably affected by our North Sea drilling contract for Gorilla VII. The contract, under which operations began in June 2003, specified an 18 month minimum term and provided for a day rate tied to an average oil price. In March 2004, following declining oil production from the first three wells, we agreed to reduce the day rate under the contract in an attempt to extend the fields economic life. In late December, we extended the contract at the existing day rate through 2005 and collected $9.6 million toward our outstanding receivables, which paid in full all amounts that originated prior to the fourth quarter. However, as our collection of additional amounts was dependent upon cash flows from the project, we ceased recognizing further drilling revenues under the contract until collected. Accordingly, we did not recognize fourth quarter revenues totaling $10.4 million, which left the year end balance of recorded receivables related to this contract at zero. Rowan had realized almost $65 million in revenues under the contract since its inception, including more than $35 million during 2004. Gorilla V was 87% utilized offshore eastern Canada in 2004 before relocating to the North Sea during the third quarter. After outfitting, the rig began a nine month drilling assignment in the Glenelg Field in January 2005. Rowans 15 actively marketed deep well land rigs were 97% utilized in Texas and Louisiana in 2004, and achieved an average day rate of $12,200 during the year, compared to 88% and $10,700 in 2003. Another rig, idle since 2001, was substantially rebuilt and returned to service in March 2005. Our carrying values and ongoing costs related to the two remaining idle rigs are not significant. Drilling operating costs increased by $24.5 million or 8% in 2004 compared to 2003, due primarily to effects of the following (in millions): New rigs Bob Palmer (August 2003) and Scooter Yeargain (May 2004) $ 13.0 Incentive compensation and retirement plan costs 6.8 Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $2.3 million or 9% in 2004, due primarily to higher professional services, incentive compensation and retirement plan costs. Depreciation and amortization increased by $8.2 million or 14% in 2004, due primarily to the addition of the rigs shown above. Outlook Worldwide rig demand is inherently volatile and has historically varied from one market to the next, as has the supply of competitive equipment. Exploration and development expenditures are affected by many local factors, such as political and regulatory policies, seasonal weather patterns, lease expirations, and new oil and gas discoveries. In the end, however, the level and expected direction of oil and natural gas prices are what most impact drilling activity. With consistently high prices in recent years, energy companies have realized substantial cash flows which we believe should, over time, lead to additional drilling projects. Currently, the outlook for most worldwide drilling markets appears to be strong or improving. Expected demand for jack ups exceeds the supply of rigs in the Middle East, West Africa, India and most other foreign locations. Thus, energy companies in markets like the Gulf of Mexico and North Sea may be forced to aggressively compete for drilling equipment. Assuming these events occur, our drilling operations should continue to benefit. The volatility inherent in this business, however, makes any prediction of future market conditions speculative. Thus, we can offer no assurance that existing market conditions will continue beyond the near term, or that expected improvements will materialize. 26 Table of Contents Our three year contract covering four rigs in the Middle East will bring more global diversification to our drilling operations and, over time, should improve the average return on our investments. During 2005, we began drilling operations offshore Denmark and performed the first jack up drilling assignment ever undertaken in the Grand Banks area offshore Newfoundland. Our Denmark contract was recently extended for one year with a 40% increase in the day rate. We recently obtained a one year contact in Trinidad that should begin during the third quarter of 2006 and provide an 80% increase from the current Gulf of Mexico rate. We will continue to pursue overseas assignments that we believe will maximize the contribution of our offshore rigs and enhance our operating results. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused tremendous damage to drilling and production equipment and facilities throughout the Gulf Coast during the third quarter of 2005, and we suffered a significant loss of current and prospective revenues. These storms also had the effect of further reducing the supply of available drilling equipment in the Gulf of Mexico, which has thus far greatly improved market conditions for our remaining rigs. We were recently awarded a two year $160 170 million contract to drill one or more ultra deep shelf wells. The cost of doing business there, however, is also rising, especially in the insurance area. Though we have obtained coverage for our offshore operations and fleet beyond the end of 2006, our annual insurance cost will be about four times the pre storm level and we have assumed more of the risk of certain losses. Following the 2005 hurricanes, and based upon improving business conditions, we accelerated our building program to provide earlier deliveries of the Hank Boswell (third quarter 2006) and our fourth Tarzan Class rig (expected third quarter 2007) and expanded it to include the construction of two of a new class of jack up, the 240C. We expect delivery of the first 240C in mid 2008 and the second in early 2009. The Rowan Louisiana, which was significantly damaged during Hurricane Rita, is currently undergoing repairs and is expected to rejoin the Companys fleet during the third quarter of 2006. Additionally, we saw land drilling day rates improve and drilling assignments lengthen in 2005 to the point where long term contracts became available from many energy companies looking for newly constructed rigs. During the third quarter, we obtained drilling contracts for six new 2000 horsepower rigs covering 14 rig years. Another six new rigs are on order and four of these have three year drilling contracts. All of the new land rigs will contain the latest products from our manufacturing division, including the drawworks, mud pumps, top drive, rotary table and power controls. Our drilling operations are currently benefiting from predominantly favorable market conditions worldwide and are profitable. There is no assurance, however, that such conditions will be sustained beyond the near term or that our drilling operations will remain profitable. Our drilling operations will be adversely affected if market conditions deteriorate. Manufacturing Operations We have manufacturing facilities in Longview and Houston, Texas and Vicksburg, Mississippi that collectively produce mining, timber and transportation equipment, alloy steel and steel plate, and drilling rigs and various rig components. Our manufacturing division built the first jack up drilling rig in 1955 and has designed or built more than 200 rigs since, including all 20 in our fleet. During 2005, the division delivered the second Tarzan Class jack up, the Bob Keller, achieved significant construction progress on the third, the Hank Boswell, began construction of the fourth and developed a new jack up rig design, the 240C. 27 Table of Contents 2005 Compared to 2004 Rowans manufacturing division achieved an $85.8 million or 41% increase in revenues in 2005, primarily comprised as follows (dollars in millions): %increase 2005 2004 (decrease) Equipment group $ 157.0 $ 114.3 37 % Marine group 53.5 28.1 91 % Drilling products group 35.1 16.1 118 % Steel group 32.1 30.5 5 % Drive systems group 15.7 18.6 (16 )% The equipment group shipped 34 new mining loaders and log stackers in 2005, up from 23 units in 2004. Parts sales improved by $4.7 million or 12% during 2005. Marine group revenues in 2005 included $36.1 million recognized on long term rig and rig kit construction projects that began during the year. The drilling products group shipped 39 mud pumps to outside customers during 2005, up from 23 in 2004. The steel group experienced an 18% decrease in external steel shipments in 2005 that was more than offset by a 28% increase in average steel prices during the year. Internal steel shipments increased by 300% in 2005. Drive systems group revenues declined during 2005 due primarily to efforts required to complete a $10 million dredge barge for the US Army Corps of Engineers. Our mining equipment, especially the smaller loaders, has traditionally yielded lower margins than the related after market parts sales. In addition, a rig construction project usually takes longer to complete and involves a significantly greater labor effort than a rig kit, and thus typically yields a lower margin. As a result of the greater activity in these areas in 2005, our direct cost of sales increased by $71.9 million or 46% during the year, and our average margin declined to 22% of revenues in 2005 from 25% in 2004. A $2.3 million loss incurred on the dredge barge project contributed to the decline in margins in 2005. Other manufacturing operating expenses increased by $4.7 million or 22% in 2005 compared to 2004, due primarily to incremental engineering efforts and higher shipping and warehousing costs. Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $6.1 million or 44% in 2005, due primarily to higher selling related expenses, professional service fees associated with Sarbanes Oxley Act compliance and incentive compensation costs. Depreciation and amortization increased by $1.9 million or 19% in 2005, due primarily to ongoing capacity improvements at our manufacturing facilities. As a result, operating income increased by only $0.9 million or 13% during the year, and remained unchanged at 3% of revenues in 2005. Our 2005 manufacturing operating results exclude the effects of approximately $118 million of products and services provided at cost to our drilling division during the year, most of which was attributable to completion of the Bob Keller and construction progress on the Hank Boswell. 2004 Compared to 2003 Rowans manufacturing division achieved a $70.5 million or 51% increase in revenues in 2004, primarily comprised as follows (dollars in millions): 2004 2003 % increase Equipment group $ 114.3 $ 78.3 46 % Steel group 30.5 16.9 80 % Marine group 28.1 23.3 21 % Drive systems group 18.6 9.1 104 % Drilling products group 16.1 9.4 71 % The equipment group shipped 23 new mining loaders and log stackers in 2004, up from 14 units in 2003. Parts sales improved by $4.2 million or 12% during 2004. Growing worldwide demand enabled the steel group to achieve a $13.6 million or 81% increase in revenues in 2004 on a 45% increase in external steel shipments. Average steel selling prices increased by more than 50% during the year, which helped to offset the impact of higher steel costs on 28 Table of Contents the other manufacturing groups. Marine group revenues in 2004 included $8.2 million of incremental specialty fabrication work. Drive systems group revenues included $7.5 million recognized on the $10 million dredge barge for the US Army Corps of Engineers. The drilling products group shipped 23 mud pumps to outside customers during 2004, up from 15 in 2003. Our mining equipment, especially the smaller loaders, has traditionally yielded lower margins than the related after market parts sales. Thus, our direct cost of sales increased by $60.0 million or 63% during the year, and our average margin declined to 25% of revenues in 2004 from 30% in 2003. Other manufacturing operating expenses increased by $3.2 million or 18% in 2004 compared to 2003, due primarily to incremental engineering efforts and higher shipping and warehousing costs. Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $2.3 million or 20% in 2004, due primarily to higher selling related expenses, professional service fees and incentive compensation costs. Depreciation and amortization increased by $0.3 million or 3% in 2004. As a result, operating income increased by $4.6 million during the year, and improved to 3% of revenues in 2004. Our 2004 manufacturing operating results exclude the effects of approximately $83 million of products and services provided at cost to our drilling division during the year, most of which was attributable to completion of the Scooter Yeargain and construction progress on the Bob Keller. Outlook Though considerably less volatile than our drilling operations, our manufacturing operations, especially the equipment group, are impacted by world commodities prices; in particular, prices for copper, iron ore, coal and gold. In addition, the prospects for our marine and drilling products groups are closely tied to the condition of the overall drilling industry and its demand for equipment, parts and services. Many commodity prices are at or near historically high levels due to growth in worldwide demand. Our external manufacturing backlog at December 31, 2005, of approximately $388 million, was almost five times the prior year level and at an all time high. The backlog included $225 million related to the long term marine construction projects that are expected to run through April 2008 and $90 million associated with 19 loaders and stackers and 63 mud pumps that should be shipped during 2006. Thus far, we have been able to pass along the effects of cost increases to our customers in the form of higher sales prices. During 2005, in order to meet the growing demand for the Companys manufacturing products, we began expanding the steel production capacity and upgrading facilities and machinery to enable faster delivery of rig components and other manufacturing products. We are optimistic that prices will remain firm, sustaining the demand for the types of equipment that we provide, and that our increased volumes will yield improved profitability. We cannot, however, accurately predict the duration of current business conditions or their impact on our operations. Our manufacturing operations will be adversely affected if conditions deteriorate. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Key balance sheet amounts and ratios for 2005 and 2004 were as follows (dollars in millions): DECEMBER 31, 2005 2004 Cash and cash equivalents $ 675.9 $ 466.0 Current assets $ 1,208.1 $ 807.1 Current liabilities $ 340.6 $ 234.8 Current ratio 3.55 3.44 Current maturities of long term debt $ 64.9 $ 64.9 Long term debt $ 550.3 $ 574.4 Stockholders equity $ 1,619.7 $ 1,408.9 Long term debt/total capitalization .25 .29 29 Table of Contents Reflected in the comparison above are the effects in 2005 of the following sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents: net cash provided by operations of $333.2 million capital expenditures of $199.8 million proceeds from asset disposals of $120.7 million debt repayments of $61.9 million cash dividend payments to our stockholders of $54.1 million proceeds from borrowings of $37.9 million proceeds from stock option and convertible debenture plans of $34.0 million Operating cash flows in 2005 included non cash or non operating adjustments to our net income totaling $89.8 million and additional working capital of $19.5 million. Non cash or non operating adjustments included deferred income taxes of $121.7 million, depreciation of $81.3 million and hurricane related insurance proceeds of $51.4 million, offset by pension contributions and other benefit payments of $92.5 million and net gains on asset disposals of $101.7 million during the year. The primary source of working capital was customer advances under sales contracts and toward future drilling services, which increased by $94 million in 2005 and more than offset our additional investments made in trade receivables and inventories during the year. Capital expenditures in 2005 included $119.8 million towards construction of our second and third Tarzan Class jack up rigs, the Bob Keller and the Hank Boswell. The Tarzan Class was designed specifically for deep drilling in water depths up to 300 feet on the outer continental shelf in the Gulf of Mexico, offering drilling capabilities similar to our Super Gorilla class jack ups, but with reduced environmental criteria (wind, wave and current) and at around one half the construction cost. Construction of the Bob Keller was completed on August 31, 2005 and substantially financed through a long term bank loan guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Transportations Maritime Administration (MARAD). Under the MARAD Title XI Program, we obtain reimbursements for qualifying expenditures up to a pre approved limit based upon actual construction progress. Outstanding borrowings initially bear a floating rate of interest and notes require semi annual payments of principal and accrued interest. The notes are secured by a preferred mortgage on the rig. All of our recent newbuild rigs have been financed in this manner and the following table summarizes the status of each of our Title XI borrowings at December 31, 2005 (dollars in millions).

Rowan may fix these interest rates at any time and must fix them by August 18, 2007 and August 31, 2009, respectively. On June 15, 2005, we fixed the interest rate on our Scooter Yeargain note at 4.33%. The Hank Boswell is being constructed at our Vicksburg, Mississippi facility with delivery expected during the third quarter of 2006. Construction of a fourth Tarzan Class jack up is underway and should be completed during the third quarter of 2007. We have subcontracted with another shipyard for construction of the hull. We have applied to MARAD for Title XI government guaranteed financing for up to $176 million of the cost of the third and fourth Tarzan Class rigs on terms and conditions similar to those in effect for the Bob Keller. If we are unable to obtain this or any other outside financing, we could be forced to continue using working capital, if available, or postpone construction. 30 Table of Contents In November 2005, our Board of Directors approved the construction of two of a new class of jack up rig. The 240C will be equipped for high pressure/high temperature drilling in water depths of up to 400 feet. We believe the 240C design will set a new standard as a replacement for the 116C, which has been the workhorse of the global drilling industry for the past 25 years. The 240C will have more deck space, higher variable load, more drilling capacity (two million pound hook load capability), more cantilever reach (up to 100 feet) and greater personnel capacity (108 man) than the 116C. Each rig will cost approximately $165 million and will be constructed at Vicksburg, Mississippi with delivery expected in mid 2008 and early 2009. We currently anticipate funding construction with available cash, but will consider attractive financing alternatives. If we are unable to obtain any outside financing, we could be forced to continue using working capital, if available, or postpone construction. Capital expenditures in 2005 included $26.2 million for the reactivation of one existing land rig during the fourth quarter and progress towards the construction of 12 new 2000 horsepower land rigs for delivery during 2006. These expenditures have been and we expect will continue to be financed from existing working capital. Capital expenditures are for new assets or enhancements to existing assets, as expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. The remainder of 2005 capital expenditures was primarily for major enhancements to existing offshore rigs and manufacturing facilities. Our 2006 capital budget has initially been set at approximately $468 million, and includes $140 million for the third and fourth Tarzan Class rigs, $137 million for the new land rigs and $71 million toward the first 240C class rig. We will periodically review and adjust the capital budget as necessary based upon our existing working capital and anticipated market conditions in our drilling and manufacturing businesses. Rowan received $120.7 million in 2005 in connection with the disposal of various assets. In February, we sold the purchase options on four leased anchor handling boats for approximately $21 million in cash. In September, we sold one of our oldest jack up rigs, the Rowan Texas, for approximately $45 million in cash, after selling expenses. Another $9.6 million was received earlier in 2005 as proceeds from the sale of marketable investment securities that had a nominal carrying cost. In October 2005, we sold our only semi submersible rig for approximately $60 million in cash. Payment for the rig is expected to occur over a 15 month period ending in January 2007, at which point the title to the rig will transfer to the buyer. Rowan retained ownership of much of the drilling equipment on the rig and will continue to provide a number of operating personnel under a separate services agreement. The transaction is being accounted for as a sales type lease with the expected gain on the sale and imputed interest income of approximately $46 million deferred until the net book value of the rig has been recovered. At December 31, 2005, Rowan had received payments totaling $12.1 million and included in assets the present value of expected future collections of $45.7 million (with $14.8 million included in current assets). Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2005 (dollars in millions) Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Within 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Long term debt and interest (1) $ 777.3 $ 92.3 $ 175.2 $ 162.8 $ 347.0 Purchase obligations 86.7 81.1 4.2 1.4 Operating leases 21.0 7.2 11.4 2.4 Total $ 885.0 $ 180.6 $ 190.8 $ 166.6 $ 347.0 (1) Amounts represent contractual principal and interest payments. Interest amounts reflect either stated fixed rates or assume current floating rates remain constant throughout the period. We periodically employ letters of credit or other bank issued guarantees in the normal course of our businesses, and were contingently liable for performance under such agreements to the extent of approximately $14.9 million at December 31, 2005. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments. Our debt agreements contain provisions that require minimum levels of working capital and stockholders equity, limit the amount of long term debt and, in the event of noncompliance, restrict investment activities, asset 31 Table of Contents purchases and sales, lease obligations, borrowings and mergers or acquisitions. We were in compliance with each of our debt covenants at December 31, 2005. We have contributed $131.4 million to our defined benefit pension plans over the past three years, including almost $90 million during 2005. Minimum contribution amounts are determined based upon actuarial calculations of pension assets and liabilities that involve, among other things, assumptions about long term asset returns and interest rates. Similar calculations were used to estimate pension costs and obligations as reflected in our consolidated financial statements, which showed an accumulated other comprehensive loss resulting from unfunded pension liabilities of $83.7 million at December 31, 2005. We expect to make additional pension contributions over the next several years even if plan assets perform as expected, though our funding requirement for 2006 is expected to be approximately $3 million. Pending federal legislation aimed at strengthening underfunded pension plans could significantly increase and accelerate our future funding requirements. We currently estimate that our 2006 pension expense will increase by approximately $5 million or about 25% over the 2005 amount. On February 25, 2005, in conjunction with the sale of our aviation operations, we paid a special cash dividend of $.25 per share of our common stock to stockholders of record on February 9, 2005. On September 1, 2005, in conjunction with the sale of several non core assets, we paid a special cash dividend of $.25 per share of our common stock to stockholders of record on August 17, 2005. Rowan did not pay any dividends during 2004 and, at December 31, 2005, had approximately $563 million of retained earnings available for distribution to stockholders under the most restrictive provisions of our debt agreements. On February 24, 2006, we paid a special cash dividend of $.25 per common share to stockholders of record on February 8, 2006. Future dividends, if any, will only be paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors. In December 2003, we filed a $500 million universal shelf registration statement. In early 2004, we sold 11.5 million shares of common stock, consisting of approximately 1.7 million shares of treasury stock and 9.8 million newly issued shares. The net proceeds of approximately $265 million were retained for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. The treasury shares were acquired in the open market at various dates during 2000 2002 and had an average cost of $17.33 per share. Based on current and anticipated near term operating levels, we believe that operating cash flows together with existing working capital will be adequate to sustain planned capital expenditures and debt service and other requirements at least through the remainder of 2006. We currently have no other available credit facilities, but believe financing could be obtained if deemed necessary. We leased the jack up Rowan Halifax under a charter agreement that commenced in 1984 and was scheduled to expire in March 2008. The rig was insured for $43.4 million prior to being lost during Hurricane Rita in September 2005. We believe the insured value satisfied the requirements of the charter agreement, and by a margin sufficient to cover the $6.3 million carrying value of our equipment installed on the rig. However, the owner of the rig has claimed that the rig should have been insured for its fair market value and may seek recovery from Rowan for compensation above the insured value. Thus, we have assumed no insurance proceeds related to the Rowan Halifax and recorded a charge during the third quarter of 2005 for the full carrying value of our equipment. On November 3, 2005, the Company filed a declaratory judgement action in Texas state court to resolve the disagreement among the parties. Recent appraisals obtained by the owner indicate that the fair market value of the rig ranged from $75 $91 million. During the second quarter of 2005, we learned that a unit of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is conducting an investigation of potential antitrust violations among helicopter transportation providers in the Gulf of Mexico. Our former aviation subsidiary, which was sold effective December 31, 2004, has received a subpoena in connection with the investigation. We have not been contacted by the DOJ, but the purchaser has made a claim that we are responsible for any exposure it may have. We have disputed that claim. During 2004, we learned that a unit of the DOJ is conducting a criminal investigation of environmental matters involving several of our offshore drilling rigs. We are cooperating with the investigation, including responding to the DOJs subpoenas for certain documentation regarding our operations. We do not have sufficient information at this time to comment on the possible outcome of the investigation. 32 Table of Contents We are involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to our businesses and are vigorously defending our position in all such matters. We believe that there are no known contingencies, claims or lawsuits that will have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies and Management Estimates Rowans significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 41 of this Form 10 K. These policies, and management judgments, assumptions and estimates made in their application, underlie reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that Rowans most critical accounting policies and management estimates involve revenue recognition, primarily upfront service fees for equipment moves and modifications and long term manufacturing projects, property and depreciation, particularly capitalizable costs, useful lives and salvage values, and pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs, specifically assumptions used in actuarial calculations, as changes in such policies and or estimates would produce significantly different amounts from those reported herein. Revenue Recognition. Rowans drilling contracts generally provide for payment on a day rate basis, and revenues are recognized as the work progresses with the passage of time. We frequently receive lump sum payments at the outset of a drilling assignment as upfront service fees for equipment moves or modifications, and such payments (and related costs) are recognized as drilling revenues (and expenses) over the contract period. At December 31, 2005, we had deferred $0.7 million of revenues and $2.7 million of costs related to such upfront service fees. Rowan generally recognizes manufacturing sales and related costs when title passes as products are shipped. Revenues from long term manufacturing projects such as rigs and rig kits are recognized on the percentage of completion basis using costs incurred relative to total estimated costs. We do not recognize any estimated profit until such projects are at least 10% complete, though a full provision is made immediately for any anticipated losses. Total estimated costs are critical to this process and are therefore reviewed on a regular basis. At December 31, 2005, we had received $90.2 million of progress payments toward long term manufacturing projects and had recognized $36.1 million of manufacturing revenues and $29.8 million of costs related to such projects on the percentage of completion basis. Property and depreciation. Rowan provides depreciation under the straight line method from the date an asset is placed into service based upon estimated service lives ranging up to 40 years and salvage values ranging up to 20%. Rowan continues to operate 14 offshore rigs that were placed into service during 1972 1986 and assigned lives ranging from 12 to 15 years. Our newest and most significant assets, the Super Gorilla and Tarzan Class rigs, which collectively comprise almost two thirds of our property, plant and equipment carrying value, carry a 25 year service life. Expenditures for new property or enhancements to existing property are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Capitalized cost includes labor expended during installation and, on newly constructed assets, a portion of interest cost incurred during the construction period. Long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable, such as following a sustained deficit in operating cash flows caused by a prominent decline in overall rig activity and average day rates. Pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs. As previously mentioned, our pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs are based upon actuarial computations that reflect our assumptions about future events, including long term asset returns, interest rates, annual compensation increases, mortality rates and other factors. Key assumptions at December 31, 2005 included discount rates ranging from 5.56% to 5.68%, an expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets of 8% and annual healthcare cost increases ranging from 10% in 2006 to 5% in 2011 and beyond. The assumed discount rate is based upon the average yield for Moodys Aa rated corporate bonds with maturities matched to expected benefit payments and the rate of return assumption reflects a probability distribution of expected long term returns that is weighted based upon plan asset allocations. A 1 percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase our recorded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities by approximately $60 million, while a 1% change in the expected long term rate of return 33 Table of Contents on plan assets would change annual net benefits cost by approximately $2.8 million. The effects of a 1% change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate are disclosed in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 52 of this Form 10 K. The Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, signed into law on December 8, 2003 (the Act), introduced a prescription drug benefit under Medicare (Part D) and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare plans that provide benefits at least actuarially equivalent to Part D. We believe that our post 65 drug coverage is at least actuarially equivalent to Part D and, accordingly, that we will be entitled to the subsidy. A remeasurement of our accumulated plan benefit obligations (APBO) to include the effects of the Act yielded a $1.4 million reduction in APBO at January 1, 2004, which reduced the unrecognized actuarial loss, and a $46,000 reduction in estimated 2004 net postretirement benefits cost that we recognized in the fourth quarter. Rowan uses the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. We estimate that use of the fair value method outlined by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, as amended, would have reduced (increased) reported amounts of net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share by $3.0 million or $.02 per diluted share in 2005, $(3.1) million or $(.03) per diluted share in 2004 and $(4.2) million or $(.05) per diluted share in 2003. Rowan adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, as amended, effective January 1, 2006. Statement No. 123R requires recognition as expense stock based compensation associated with unvested awards measured using the fair value method. We currently estimate that the provisions of Statement No. 123R will increase our 2006 compensation expense from that measured under APB 25 by approximately $6.5 million, with half of that amount occurring during the first four months of the year. Rowans adoption, effective January 1, 2006, of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 151, Inventory Costs, which clarifies the distinction between costs that are allocable to inventory and those that are expensed as incurred, did not materially impact our financial position or results of operations. This report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including, without limitation, statements as to the expectations, beliefs and future expected financial performance of Rowan that are based on current expectations and are subject to certain risks, trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected by us. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following: oil and natural gas prices the level of exploration and development expenditures by energy companies energy demand the general economy, including inflation weather conditions in our principal operating areas environmental and other laws and regulations Other relevant factors have been disclosed in our previous filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and are included in under PART I, ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS beginning on page 10 of this Form 10 K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS Rowans outstanding debt at December 31, 2005 was comprised as follows: $362.1 million of fixed rate notes bearing a weighted average annual interest rate of 4.59% and $253.2 million of floating rate notes bearing a weighted average annual interest rate of 4.53%. Rowan believes that its exposure to risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates is limited in that the Company may fix the interest rate on its outstanding floating rate debt at any time. In addition, virtually all of Rowans transactions are carried out in United States dollars; thus, the Companys foreign currency exposure is not material. Fluctuating commodity prices affect Rowans future earnings materially to the extent that they influence demand for the Companys products and services. Rowan does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments. 34 Table of Contents
