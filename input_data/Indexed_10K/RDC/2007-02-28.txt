ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table highlights Rowans operating results for the years indicated (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Revenues: Drilling $ 1,067.4 $ 775.4 $ 472.1 Manufacturing 443.3 293.4 207.6 Total $ 1,510.7 $ 1,068.8 $ 679.7 Operating income: Drilling $ 447.7 $ 332.9 $ 51.7 Manufacturing 38.0 7.7 6.8 Total $ 485.7 $ 340.6 $ 58.5 Income from continuing operations $ 317.0 $ 217.8 $ 27.5 Income (loss) from discontinued operations $ 1.2 $ 12.0 $ (28.8 ) Net income (loss) $ 318.2 $ 229.8 $ (1.3 ) As indicated in the preceding table, Rowans results of operations are heavily dependent upon the performance of our drilling division, which comprises about 94% of our fixed assets and, over the past three years, has generated 71% of our aggregate revenues and 94% of our aggregate operating income. Our manufacturing division has led the strategic expansion and upgrade of our drilling fleet and, in recent years, has improved its contribution to our operating results. The performance of each of our continuing operations over the 2004 2006 period is discussed more fully below. The amounts shown in the table above for Income (loss) from discontinued operations reflect the aggregate after tax results of our aviation and boat operations for each of the past three years, including a $13.1 million after tax gain recognized on the sale of our boat purchase options in 2005 and a $16.0 million after tax loss recognized on the sale of our aviation operations in 2004. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements on page 59 of this Form 10 K for further information regarding the Companys discontinued operations. Drilling Operations Rowans drilling operating results are a function of rig activity and day rates in our principal operating areas, which have historically been offshore in the Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea and eastern Canada and onshore in Texas and Louisiana. In 2006, we returned to the Middle East market with four jack up rigs and have doubled our presence there in early 2007. We are selective in pursuing work in other overseas markets where our premium and harsh environment jack up rigs are well suited, and seek opportunities to maximize long term returns. Rig activity and day rates are primarily determined by energy company exploration and development expenditures, which are heavily influenced by oil and natural gas prices, and the availability of competitive equipment. Day rates generally follow the trend in rig activity and, due to intense competition in the contract drilling industry, both have historically declined much faster than they have risen. Our rig fleets consist currently of 21 offshore jack up rigs and 26 land rigs. Our offshore fleet features three Gorilla class jack ups built during the early 1980s, four Super Gorilla class jack ups constructed during the 1998 2003 period, and three Tarzan Class jack ups delivered in the 2004 2006 period. Three additional jack ups are under construction or on order with deliveries expected over the next three years. Our land fleet includes nine newly constructed rigs, four rigs built during 2001 2002 and 11 rigs that have been refurbished in recent years. Three additional land rigs are expected to be completed during 2007. For the past several years, our offshore drilling operations have been focused in the Gulf of Mexico, where nine of our offshore rigs are currently deployed. This market is extremely fragmented among many oil and gas companies, many of whom are independent operators whose drilling activities are often highly dependent upon near term operating cash flows. A typical drilling assignment may call for 30 60 days of exploration or development work, performed under a single well contract with negotiable renewal options. Long term contracts have been rare, and generally are available only from the major integrated oil companies and a few of the larger independent operators. Thus, drilling activity and day rates in this market have tended to fluctuate rather quickly, and generally follow trends in natural gas prices. Rowan generally avoided long term commitments in the past unless they provided opportunities for rate adjustments in the future. 23 Table of Contents As discussed more fully below, high natural gas prices and the continued migration of rigs to foreign markets in recent years, coupled with the significant loss of equipment in 2005 due to hurricanes, have created a jack up supply deficit in the Gulf of Mexico. As a result, rig day rates, which increased dramatically in 2005, continued to set new records in 2006, and the occasional term drilling contract, ranging from six months to two years, has become available for high specification rigs. These opportunities have been more prevalent in other markets, however, and Rowan has recently moved rigs from the Gulf of Mexico in pursuit of longer term commitments. The North Sea is a mature, harsh environment offshore drilling market that has long been dominated by major oil and gas companies operating within a relatively tight regulatory environment. Project lead times are often lengthy and drilling assignments, which typically require ultra premium equipment capable of handling high down hole pressures and temperatures, can range from several months to several years. Thus, drilling activity and day rates in the North Sea move slowly in response to market conditions, and generally follow trends in oil prices. Following a two year absence, we returned to the North Sea with the newbuild Gorilla VII in early 2002, and added Gorilla V to that market in late 2004. Gorilla VII is currently committed through the third quarter of 2007 while the Gorilla V commitment should extend into the fourth quarter of 2008. Gorilla VI recently relocated to the North Sea from eastern Canada for work in both the UK and Norwegian sectors that should extend into the second quarter of 2008. We have operated offshore eastern Canada at varying levels since the early 1980s, and our presence there peaked at three fully utilized rigs in mid 2000. More recently, demand for harsh environment jack ups in the area has been sporadic and the departure of Gorilla VI leaves us with no drilling operations there at the present time. In August 2005, we obtained a three year contract from Saudi Aramco covering four jack up rigs offshore Saudi Arabia, our first drilling assignment in the Middle East in 25 years. The Rowan Middletown, Charles Rowan, Arch Rowan and Rowan California departed the Gulf of Mexico in January 2006 and commenced operations in the Persian Gulf in April. During 2006, we obtained two additional commitments in the Middle East market: a two year contract for two jack up rigs for Maersk offshore Qatar, which we commenced in late January 2007 with the Rowan Paris and Gilbert Rowe, and a four year contract for Saudi Aramco for two Tarzan Class jack ups, the Scooter Yeargain and Hank Boswell, which should begin in late March 2007. Rowan has never cold stacked its drilling rigs during slack periods as we believe the long term costs of retraining personnel and restarting equipment negates any short term savings. Thus, our drilling expenses do not typically fluctuate with rig activity, though they have increased as our rig fleets have been expanded and relocated. Rig fleet additions in recent years have included the Tarzan Class jack ups Hank Boswell (September 2006), Bob Keller (August 2005) and Scooter Yeargain (April 2004), eight new land rigs delivered in 2006 and four existing land rigs that were refurbished during 2005 (two rigs) and 2003 (two rigs). 2006 Compared to 2005 The following table highlights the performance of our drilling division during 2006 compared to 2005 (dollars in millions): 2006 2005 % increase Revenues $ 1,067.4 $ 775.4 38 % Operating income 447.7 332.9 34 % Operating income as a % of revenues 42 % 43 % Drilling revenues increased by $292.0 million in 2006, due primarily to the effects of increased average day rates, which more than offset the net impact of changes in our rigs fleets and reduced drilling activity for relocating rigs, as follows (in millions): Increase in average day rates $ 357.3 Rigs lost/damaged in 2005 hurricanes (75.4 ) Rigs sold (28.8 ) New rigs 28.0 Increase in rebillable expenses 23.9 Other, primarily reduced activity for relocating rigs (13.0 ) 24 Table of Contents Our overall offshore fleet utilization was 86% in 2006, down from 96% in 2005, as several rigs were being prepared for long term assignments overseas. We compute rig utilization as revenue producing days divided by total available rig days. Our average offshore day rate was $141,500 in 2006, an increase of approximately 81% over 2005. Average day rates are determined as recorded revenues, excluding rebilled expenses, divided by revenue producing days. Total revenue producing days declined by just over 1,000 or 7% between years, with much of that decrease associated with the rigs that were being prepared for long term assignments overseas. Natural gas prices remained at historically high levels throughout 2006, though mild weather contributed to a decline from the record average prices experienced during 2005. The migration of competitive jack ups from the Gulf of Mexico continued during 2006, which enabled higher rates for those rigs that remained in the area, and our day rates easily surpassed our all time high levels. The following table summarizes average natural gas prices and our Gulf of Mexico fleet utilization and average day rates during the year: Natural Average Average Gas (MCF)* Utilization Day Rate First quarter 2006 $ 7.84 96 % $ 123,500 Second quarter 2006 6.65 96 % 143,500 Third quarter 2006 6.18 88 % 150,600 Fourth quarter 2006 7.24 83 % 140,300 Full year 2006 6.98 91 % 139,000 Full year 2005 9.02 97 % 71,100 * Source: New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) As shown in the preceding table, our average Gulf of Mexico day rate increased by 95% in 2006, though rates began to weaken somewhat during the fourth quarter. The onset of the hurricane season in June dampened overall drilling activity during the third quarter, forcing available rigs to compete for fewer, shallow water opportunities, and many operators had exhausted much of their drilling budgets before the end of the year. Our third Tarzan Class jack up, the Hank Boswell, was delivered and commenced operations in the Gulf of Mexico in September. The Rowan Louisiana, which was severely damaged in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina, was returned to service in December 2006. Eight rigs either began or ended the year mobilizing from the Gulf of Mexico: four rigs commenced operations in Saudi Arabia in April 2006, two rigs began drilling in Qatar in January 2007 and two additional rigs were in the shipyard preparing to relocate to Saudi Arabia at year end. In addition, the Gorilla III left the Gulf of Mexico in August and began work in Trinidad in September. As a result, our total revenue producing days in the Gulf of Mexico decreased by 3,479 or 47% during 2006. Spot oil prices continued to set records in 2006. Prices on the NYMEX traded between $55 and $70 per barrel for almost the entire year, reaching an all time high of $77 per barrel in July, and ended the year at around $60. Thus, many foreign markets like the Middle East continued to lure jack ups from the Gulf of Mexico with long term contracts at attractive rates. Our four jack ups working offshore Saudi Arabia generated approximately $115 million of drilling revenues in 2006, averaging more than $113,000 per day. Demand for harsh environment equipment in the North Sea improved during the year enabling us to keep our rigs fully utilized and, as noted previously, increase our contracted backlog in the area. Gorilla V was 95% utilized in the UK sector of the North Sea in 2006 and generated more than $138,000 per day in drilling revenues during the year. Gorilla VII was 98% utilized offshore Denmark in 2006 and averaged more than $198,000 per day there in drilling revenues during the year. Gorilla VI was 85% utilized and generated almost $184,000 per day in drilling revenues offshore eastern Canada during 2006. Gorilla III was relocated from the Gulf of Mexico to Trinidad during the third quarter of 2006, where the rig was fully utilized and averaged more than $186,000 per day in drilling revenues during the remainder of the year. Our 25 land rigs were 97% utilized in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma in 2006, and achieved an average day rate of $22,600 during the year, compared to 98% and $18,400 in 2005. The fleet included eight of twelve new 2000 horsepower rigs that were constructed during the year. One additional new land rig was completed in early 2007 and the remaining three rigs are expected to be delivered during the first and third quarters of 2007. Ten of the twelve new rigs have been contracted for terms ranging from two to three years. 25 Table of Contents Drilling operating costs increased by $117.1 million or 30% in 2006 compared to 2005, due primarily to effects of the following (in millions): Insurance increased by 355% $ 37.0 Rebillable expenses primarily towing costs increased by 90% 23.9 Repairs and maintenance for existing rigs increased by 28% 17.0 New rigs primarily Bob Keller (September 2005), Hank Boswell (September 2006) and eight land rigs 14.5 Labor costs increased by 8% 11.2 Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $4.5 million or 10% in 2006, due primarily to additional incentive compensation costs following the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R. Depreciation and amortization increased by $8.1 million or 12% in 2006, due primarily to the addition of the rigs noted above. Drilling operating income in 2006 included $28.2 million of gains on asset disposals during the year, $24.5 million of which related to the installment sale of the Rowan Midland and related equipment, compared to $66.8 million in 2005, which resulted from both asset disposals and the net excess insurance recoveries related to our losses during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Our 2006 operating results also included a $9 million charge for fines and environmental fund payments expected to be made in connection with a Department of Justice investigation. This matter is discussed more fully under Liquidity and Capital Resources on page 34. 2005 Compared to 2004 The following table highlights the performance of our drilling division during 2005 compared to 2004 (dollars in millions): 2005 2004 % increase Revenues $ 775.4 $ 472.1 64 % Operating income 332.9 51.7 544 % Operating income as a % of revenues 43 % 11 % Drilling revenues increased by $303.3 million in 2005, due primarily to the effects of increased average day rates, as follows (in millions): Increase in average day rates $ 254.6 Increase in drilling activity, including net impact of changes in rig fleets 31.2 Increase in rebillable expenses 17.5 Our overall offshore fleet utilization was 96% in 2005, up from 92% in 2004. Our average offshore day rate was $78,100 in 2005, an increase of approximately 60% over 2004. We compute rig utilization as revenue producing days divided by total available rig days. Average day rates are determined as recorded revenues, excluding rebilled expenses, divided by revenue producing days. Natural gas prices were at historically high levels in early 2005, and increased further during the year primarily due to declining domestic production and growing demand. Prices went even higher following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, as significant gas production from the Gulf of Mexico was shut in due to damaged platforms and pipelines. These storms also removed eight units from the competitive jack up fleet, including four of our rigs. Another six rigs migrated to foreign markets during the year. As a result, we were able to consistently increase our Gulf of Mexico day rates during 2005. The following table summarizes average natural gas prices and our Gulf of Mexico fleet utilization and average day rates during 2005: Natural Average Average Gas (MCF)* Utilization Day Rate First quarter 2005 $ 6.50 98 % $ 58,000 Second quarter 2005 6.95 97 % 66,500 Third quarter 2005 9.73 99 % 74,400 Fourth quarter 2005 12.88 94 % 92,100 Full year 2005 9.02 97 % 71,100 Full year 2004 6.18 92 % 45,200 * Source: New York Mercantile Exchange 26 Table of Contents As shown in the preceding table, our average Gulf of Mexico day rate increased by 57% in 2005. Our Gulf of Mexico fleet declined to 17 units during the year as four rigs were lost during the hurricanes, two rigs were sold and one rig was relocated to eastern Canada. Another rig was severely damaged during Hurricane Katrina. Our second Tarzan Class jack up, the Bob Keller, was delivered in August and commenced operations in September. As a result, our total revenue producing days in the Gulf of Mexico decreased by 221 or 3% during 2005. Four of our rigs departed the area in early 2006 for work in Saudi Arabia. Oil prices reached new heights during 2005, peaking at just below $70 per barrel, and ended the year at around $65. Thus, rig demand remained strong in most foreign markets, which contributed to the further migration of jack ups from the Gulf of Mexico. Market conditions in our principal foreign areas, the North Sea and offshore eastern Canada, improved during the year, enabling Rowan to secure more profitable drilling assignments. Gorilla V was 94% utilized in the North Sea in 2005, and generated more than $160,000 per day in drilling revenues during the year. The Gorilla VII simultaneous drilling/production assignment in the United Kingdom sector ended during the second quarter of 2005 and the rig was relocated to Denmark during the third quarter. Gorilla VII was 94% utilized in the area and averaged more than $175,000 per day in revenues thereafter. Gorilla VI was relocated from the Gulf of Mexico to offshore eastern Canada during the second quarter of 2005, where the rig was 82% utilized and generated almost $160,000 per day in revenues during the remainder of the year. Rowans 17 deep well land rigs were 98% utilized in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma in 2005, and achieved an average day rate of $18,400 during the year, compared to 97% and $12,200 in 2004. The fleet includes one rig, idle since 2002, that was refurbished during the year and returned to service in late December 2005. Twelve new 2000 horsepower land rigs were at varying stages of construction at year end, ten of which are contracted for terms ranging from two to three years. Drilling operating costs increased by $67.9 million or 21% in 2005 compared to 2004, due primarily to effects of the following (in millions): Rebillable expenses primarily towing costs $ 17.5 Wage increases 14.5 Rig repairs and maintenance 13.2 New rigs primarily Scooter Yeargain (May 2004) and Bob Keller (September 2005) 11.5 UK drilling/production assignment field abandonment costs 4.5 Incentive compensation and retirement plan costs 3.6 Selling, general and administrative costs increased by 18.3 million or 68% in 2005, due primarily to higher professional services fees associated with Sarbanes Oxley Act compliance and incremental incentive compensation costs. Depreciation and amortization increased by $0.8 million or 1% in 2005, due primarily to the addition of the rigs shown above. Drilling operating income in 2005 included $52.8 million of gains on asset disposals during the year, $39.1 million of which was recognized on the sale of our 32 year old jack up Rowan Texas during the third quarter. Another $13.9 million of operating income reflects the net of insurance proceeds received over the carrying values of our four jack up rigs that were lost during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and related uninsured salvage costs. Outlook Worldwide rig demand is inherently volatile and has historically varied from one market to the next, as has the supply of competitive equipment. Exploration and development expenditures are affected by many local factors, such as political and regulatory policies, seasonal weather patterns, lease expirations, and new oil and gas discoveries. In the end, however, the level and expected direction of oil and natural gas prices are what most impact drilling activity, and oil and gas prices are ultimately a function of the supply of and demand for those commodities. With consistently high prices in recent years, energy companies have realized substantial cash flows which we believe should continue to result in additional drilling projects. 27 Table of Contents Currently, the outlook for most worldwide drilling markets appears to be strong. Expected demand for jack ups exceeds the current supply of rigs in the Middle East, West Africa, India and Southeast Asia. Thus, energy companies in mature markets like the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea may continue to be forced to aggressively compete for competitive drilling equipment, which could continue to pressure day rates upward and cause drilling assignments to lengthen. Assuming these events occur, our drilling operations should continue to benefit during 2007. The volatility inherent in this business, however, makes any prediction of future market conditions speculative. Thus, we can offer no assurance that existing market conditions will continue beyond the near term, or that any expected improvements will materialize. Our long term contracts covering eight rigs in the Middle East have brought significantly more global diversification to our drilling operations. During 2006, we also committed a third rig in the North Sea market and began an 18 month drilling assignment in Trinidad. We will continue to pursue overseas assignments that we believe will maximize the contribution of our offshore rigs and enhance our operating results. Hurricanes Katrina and Rita caused tremendous damage to drilling and production equipment and facilities throughout the Gulf Coast during 2005, and we suffered a significant loss of current and prospective revenues. These storms also reduced the supply of available drilling equipment in the Gulf of Mexico, which contributed to the dramatic increase in drilling day rates in late 2005 through mid 2006, though the average contract remains relatively short. During 2006, there was a noticeable decline in demand for drilling equipment that coincided with the onset of hurricane season in June and grew more pronounced as natural gas prices continued to weaken during the third and early fourth quarters. This ultimately forced jack up contractors, including Rowan, to accept reduced rates in certain cases in order to keep available rigs fully utilized. Though gas prices have recently rebounded, Gulf of Mexico rig demand has not returned to peak 2006 levels. This pattern of reduced rig demand during hurricane season may repeat itself in future years. The heightened global demand for drilling equipment over the past few years has naturally led to increased demand for parts, supplies and people, which has in turn increased the cost of each category. Fully utilized drilling equipment ultimately requires more extensive maintenance and repairs as well. We expect these inflationary pressures to continue somewhat in 2007 which, unless we are able to recover the increased costs through higher day rates, will reduce our future profitability. In addition, the cost of insurance in the Gulf of Mexico has risen dramatically since 2005. Though we were able to obtain coverage for our offshore operations and fleet in 2006, the cost of our coverage was almost five times the pre storm level even after we assumed more of the risk of certain losses. Our relocation of rigs from the Gulf of Mexico has helped to offset the increase in insurance rates. Our drilling operations are currently benefiting from predominantly favorable market conditions worldwide and are profitable. There is no assurance, however, that such conditions will be sustained beyond the near term or that our drilling operations will remain profitable. Our drilling operations will be adversely affected if market conditions deteriorate. Manufacturing Operations We have manufacturing facilities in Longview and Houston, Texas and Vicksburg, Mississippi that collectively produce mining, timber and transportation equipment, alloy steel and steel plate, and drilling rigs and various rig components. Our manufacturing division built the first jack up drilling rig in 1955 and has designed or built more than 200 rigs since, including all 21 in our fleet. During 2006, the division delivered the third Tarzan Class jack up, the Hank Boswell, achieved significant construction progress on the fourth, the J. P. Bussell, and began construction on the first two of a new jack up rig design, the 240C. 2006 Compared to 2005 Rowans manufacturing division achieved a $149.9 million or 51% increase in revenues in 2006, comprised as follows (dollars in millions): % increase 2006 2005 (decrease) Mining Products group $ 164.7 $ 147.0 12 % Offshore Products group 148.8 53.5 178 % Drilling Systems group 64.0 35.1 82 % Power Systems group 27.5 15.7 74 % Steel Products group 25.0 32.1 (22 )% Forestry Products group 13.3 10.0 33 % 28 Table of Contents The Mining Products group shipped 30 new front end loaders in 2006, down from 31 units in 2005, though many were the larger units which carry a higher selling price; thus, mining equipment revenues increased by 9% between periods. Mining parts sales improved by $20.0 million or 66% between periods. Offshore Products group revenues in 2006 included $103.8 million recognized on long term rig and rig kit construction projects, up from $36.1 million in 2005. The Drilling Systems group shipped 69 mud pumps to outside customers during 2006, up from 39 in 2005. Total volumes shipped by the Steel Products group were virtually unchanged at 37,100 tons in 2006, though the mix changed from 61% external in 2005 to 45% external in 2006, causing the drop in sales shown in the preceding table. The Forestry Products group shipped five log stackers in 2006, up from three units in 2005, but experienced a 46% decrease in parts sales between periods. Our manufacturing profitability is greatly influenced by the mix of our product sales. Our mining equipment, for example, has traditionally yielded lower margins than the related after market parts sales. A rig construction project takes longer to complete and involves a significantly greater labor effort than a rig kit, and thus typically yields a lower margin. Efforts by the Offshore Products group to deliver the Hank Boswell almost three months ahead of schedule caused it to incur additional costs on the other rig being built at Vicksburg, and our 2006 operating results included a $2.1 million charge for the estimated loss on that project. In addition, we recorded a $7.8 million charge during the year for the costs incurred to collect and dispose of a radioactive material that was released while processing scrap at our steel mill. As a result, along with revenues, our direct cost of sales increased in 2006 by $116.6 million or 51%, and our average margin during the year was unchanged at 22% of revenues. Other manufacturing operating expenses increased by $2.0 million or 8% in 2006 compared to 2005, due primarily to incremental engineering efforts and higher shipping and warehousing costs. Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $1.8 million or 9% in 2006, due primarily to higher selling related expenses and professional service fees associated with Sarbanes Oxley Act compliance. Depreciation and amortization increased by $0.6 million or 5% in 2006, due primarily to ongoing capacity improvements at our manufacturing facilities. As a result, operating income produced by our manufacturing division increased by $30.3 million or almost four fold during the year, and improved to 9% of revenues in 2006, up from 3% in 2005. Our 2006 manufacturing operating results exclude the effects of approximately $230 million of products and services provided at cost to our drilling division during the year, most of which was attributable to completion of the Hank Boswell and construction progress on the J. P. Bussell. 2005 Compared to 2004 Rowans manufacturing division achieved an $85.8 million or 41% increase in revenues in 2005, comprised as follows (dollars in millions): % increase 2005 2004 (decrease) Mining Products group $ 147.0 $ 104.2 41 % Offshore Products group 53.5 28.1 91 % Drilling Systems group 35.1 16.1 118 % Steel Products group 32.1 30.5 5 % Power Systems group 15.7 18.6 (16 )% Forestry Products group 10.0 10.1 (1 )% The Mining Products group shipped 31 new front end loaders in 2005, up from 19 units in 2004, and mining parts sales improved by $2.0 million or 7% between periods. Offshore Products group revenues in 2005 included $36.1 million recognized on long term rig and rig kit construction projects that began during the year. The Drilling Systems group shipped 39 mud pumps to outside customers during 2005, up from 23 in 2004. The Steel Products group experienced an 18% decrease in external steel shipments in 2005 that was more than offset by a 28% increase in average steel prices during the year. Internal steel shipments increased by 300% in 2005. Power Systems group revenues declined during 2005 due primarily to efforts required to complete a $10 million dredge barge for the US Army Corps of Engineers. The Forestry Products group shipped three log stackers in 2005, down from four units in 2004, but achieved a 23% increase in parts sales between periods. 29 Table of Contents Our mining equipment, especially the smaller loaders, has traditionally yielded lower margins than the related after market parts sales. In addition, a rig construction project usually takes longer to complete and involves a significantly greater labor effort than a rig kit, and thus typically yields a lower margin. As a result of the significantly greater activity in these areas in 2005, our direct cost of sales increased by $71.9 million or 46% during the year, and our average margin declined to 22% of revenues in 2005 from 25% in 2004. A $2.3 million loss incurred on the Power Systems dredge barge project contributed to the decline in margins in 2005. Other manufacturing operating expenses increased by $4.7 million or 22% in 2005 compared to 2004, due primarily to incremental engineering efforts and higher shipping and warehousing costs. Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $6.1 million or 44% in 2005, due primarily to higher selling related expenses, professional service fees associated with Sarbanes Oxley Act compliance and incentive compensation costs. Depreciation and amortization increased by $1.9 million or 19% in 2005, due primarily to ongoing capacity improvements at our manufacturing facilities. As a result, operating income increased by only $0.9 million or 13% during the year, and remained unchanged at 3% of revenues in 2005. Our 2005 manufacturing operating results exclude the effects of approximately $118 million of products and services provided at cost to our drilling division during the year, most of which was attributable to completion of the Bob Keller and construction progress on the Hank Boswell. Outlook Though considerably less volatile than our drilling operations, our manufacturing operations, especially the Mining Products group, are impacted by world commodities prices; in particular, prices for copper, iron ore, coal and gold. In addition, the prospects for our Offshore Products and Drilling Systems groups are closely tied to the condition of the overall drilling industry and its demand for equipment, parts and services. Many commodity prices continue to be at historically high levels due to strong worldwide demand. Our external manufacturing backlog at December 31, 2006, of approximately $530 million, was more than one third higher than the prior year level and near an all time high. The backlog included $363 million related to long term rig or rig kit construction projects that are expected to run through mid 2008 and $85 million associated with 9 mining loaders, three log stackers and 57 mud pumps that we expect to ship during 2007. Thus far, we have been able to pass along the effects of raw material and labor cost increases to our customers in the form of higher sales prices. During 2005 and 2006, in order to meet the growing demand for the Companys manufacturing products, we expanded our steel production capacity and upgraded facilities and machinery to enable faster delivery of rig components and other manufacturing products. We are optimistic that prices will remain firm, sustaining the demand for the types of equipment that we provide, and that our increased volumes will yield improved profitability. We cannot, however, accurately predict the duration of current business conditions or their impact on our operations. Our manufacturing operations will be adversely affected if conditions deteriorate. 30 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Key balance sheet amounts and ratios for 2006 and 2005 were as follows (dollars in millions): DECEMBER 31, 2006 2005 Cash and cash equivalents $ 258.0 $ 675.9 Current assets $ 1,102.8 $ 1,208.1 Current liabilities $ 516.7 $ 340.6 Current ratio 2.13 3.55 Current maturities of long term debt $ 64.9 $ 64.9 Long term debt $ 485.4 $ 550.3 Stockholders equity $ 1,874.0 $ 1,619.7 Long term debt/total capitalization. .21 .25 Reflected in the comparison above are the effects of the following sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents in 2006: net cash provided by operations of $292.1 million proceeds from asset disposals of $39.1 million proceeds from stock option and convertible debenture plans of $9.2 million capital expenditures of $479.1 million creation of a $156.1 million restricted cash balance debt repayments of $64.9 million cash dividend payments to our stockholders of $60.5 million Operating cash flows in 2006 included non cash or non operating adjustments to our net income totaling $201.0 million, less a net investment in working capital of $221.6 million. Non cash or non operating adjustments included deferred income taxes of $94.3 million, depreciation of $90.0 million and net retirement plan expenses in excess of funding of $23.9 million, partially offset by net gains on asset disposals of $30.5 million, compensation expense of $14.3 million and a $9.0 million charge for an estimated environmental fine. Working capital grew with additional investments in inventories and trade receivables in 2006 of $150 million and $135 million, respectively, which were only partially offset by net additional customer advances under sales contracts and toward future drilling services of $61 million during the year. Capital expenditures in 2006 included $113.5 million towards construction of our third and fourth Tarzan Class jack up rigs, the Hank Boswell and the J.P. Bussell, which are being financed through operating cash flows. The Tarzan Class was designed specifically for deep drilling in water depths up to 300 feet, offering drilling capabilities similar to our Super Gorilla class jack ups, but with reduced environmental criteria (wind, wave and current) and at around one half the construction cost. Rowans first two Tarzan Class jack up rigs and each of our four Super Gorilla class rigs were substantially financed through long term bank loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Transportations Maritime Administration (MARAD). Under the MARAD Title XI program, we obtained reimbursements for qualifying expenditures up to a pre approved limit based upon actual construction progress. Outstanding borrowings initially bear a floating rate of interest and notes require semi annual payments of principal and accrued interest. The notes are secured by a preferred mortgage on the rig. The following table summarizes the status of each of our Title XI borrowings at December 31, 2006 (dollars in millions).

Rowan may fix these interest rates at any time and must fix them by August 18, 2007 and August 31, 2009, respectively. As discussed more fully below, the Bob Palmer note is fully collateralized by a secured restricted cash account. The Hank Boswell was constructed at our Vicksburg, Mississippi facility and delivered in September 2006. Construction of the J.P. Bussell, for which we have subcontracted the hull to another shipyard, is in progress and should be completed by late 2007 or early 2008. We have applied to MARAD for Title XI government guaranteed financing for up to $176 million of the cost of the third and fourth Tarzan Class rigs on terms and conditions similar to those in effect for the Bob Keller. If we are unable to obtain this or any other outside financing, we could be forced to continue using working capital, if available, or postpone construction. During 2006, we began construction of the first of two of a new class of jack up rig. The 240C will be equipped for high pressure/high temperature drilling in water depths of up to 400 feet. We believe the 240C design will set a new standard as a replacement for the 116C, which has been the workhorse of the global drilling industry for the past 25 years. The 240C will have more deck space, higher variable load, more drilling capacity (two million pound hook load capability), more cantilever reach (up to 100 feet) and greater personnel capacity (108 man) than the 116C. Each rig will cost approximately $165 million and will be constructed at Vicksburg, Mississippi with delivery expected in 2008 and 2009. Capital expenditures in 2006 included $20.4 million for progress towards the construction of the first rig, which was funded from available cash. We currently anticipate funding construction of both 240C rigs with available cash, but will consider attractive financing alternatives. If we are unable to obtain any outside financing, we could be forced to continue using working capital, if available, or postpone construction. Capital expenditures in 2006 included $164.7 million for progress towards the construction of 12 new 2000 horsepower land rigs, eight of which were delivered during 2006 and one in early 2007. The three remaining rigs are expected to be delivered during the first and third quarters of 2007. These expenditures have been and should continue to be financed from existing working capital. Capital expenditures are for new assets or enhancements to existing assets, as expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. The remainder of 2006 capital expenditures was primarily for major enhancements to existing offshore rigs and manufacturing facilities. Our 2007 capital budget has initially been set at approximately $393 million, and includes $75 million for the J. P. Bussell, $146 million toward the two 240C class rigs and $17 million for the four remaining new land rigs. We will periodically review and adjust the capital budget as necessary based upon our existing working capital and anticipated market conditions in our drilling and manufacturing businesses. Rowan received $120.7 million in 2005 in connection with the disposal of various assets. In February, we sold the purchase options on four leased anchor handling boats for approximately $21 million in cash. In September, we sold one of our oldest jack up rigs, the Rowan Texas, for approximately $45 million in cash, after selling expenses. Another $9.6 million was received earlier in 2005 as proceeds from the sale of marketable investment securities that had a nominal carrying cost. In October 2005, we sold our only semi submersible rig for approximately $60 million in cash. Payment for the rig occurred over a 15 month period ending in January 2007, at which point the title to the rig was transferred to the buyer. Rowan retained ownership of much of the drilling equipment on the rig, which was sold in 2006, and has continued to provide a number of operating personnel under a separate services agreement. The transaction was accounted for as a sales type lease with the expected gain on the sale and imputed interest income of approximately $46 million deferred until the net book value of the rig has been recovered. At December 31, 2006, we had received payments totaling $35.6 million, and Trade and other receivables at that date included the balance of expected future collections of $23.4 million, which we received in January 2007. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2006 (dollars in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Within 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Long term debt and interest (1) $ 704.3 $ 91.7 $ 173.5 $ 147.8 $ 291.3 Purchase obligations 127.2 125.5 1.7 Operating leases 17.4 8.2 7.7 1.4 0.1 Total $ 848.9 $ 225.4 $ 182.9 $ 149.2 $ 291.4 (1) Amounts represent contractual principal and interest payments. Interest amounts reflect either stated fixed rates or assume current floating rates remain constant throughout the period. 32 Table of Contents We periodically employ letters of credit or other bank issued guarantees in the normal course of our businesses, and were contingently liable for performance under such agreements to the extent of approximately $49 million at December 31, 2006. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments. Our debt agreements contain provisions that require minimum levels of working capital and stockholders equity, limit the amount of long term debt and, in the event of noncompliance, restrict investment activities, asset purchases and sales, lease obligations, borrowings and mergers or acquisitions. These agreements also contain minimum insurance requirements for our collateralized drilling rigs. The extent of hurricane damage sustained throughout the Gulf Coast area in recent years has dramatically increased the cost and reduced the availability of insurance coverage for windstorm losses and, during our 2006 policy renewal, we determined that windstorm coverage meeting these requirements was cost prohibitive. Thus, we requested and received from MARAD a waiver of any defaults related to insurance requirements and provided additional security to MARAD. We have established a separate cash account containing the amount necessary to repay in full the outstanding Bob Palmer note, and in which MARAD has a security interest. This amount is shown separately as Restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We are not obligated to repay the Bob Palmer note in advance of its scheduled maturity. In addition, we agreed to maintain at least $100 million of unrestricted cash. Finally, we agreed to restrictions on the use of certain insurance proceeds should we experience further losses. Each of these additional security provisions will be released by MARAD if we obtain windstorm coverage that satisfies our existing debt requirements. We were in compliance with each of our debt covenants at December 31, 2006. We have contributed more than $145 million to our defined benefit pension plans over the past five years, including almost $90 million during 2005. Minimum contribution amounts are determined based upon actuarial calculations of pension assets and liabilities that involve, among other things, assumptions about long term asset returns and interest rates. Similar calculations were used to estimate pension costs and obligations as reflected in our consolidated financial statements, which showed an unfunded pension liability of $119.1 million at December 31, 2006. We expect to make additional pension contributions over the next several years even if plan assets perform as expected, and our funding requirement for 2007 is expected to be approximately $11 million. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 generally requires that plans be fully funded within seven years, and will therefore increase and accelerate our annual funding requirements beginning in 2008. We currently estimate that our 2007 pension expense will decrease by approximately $2.6 million or about 10% from the 2006 amount. On February 25, 2005, in conjunction with the sale of our aviation operations, we paid a special cash dividend of $.25 per share of our common stock to stockholders of record on February 9, 2005. On September 1, 2005, in conjunction with the sale of several non core assets, we paid a special cash dividend of $.25 per share of our common stock to stockholders of record on August 17, 2005. On February 24, 2006, we paid a special cash dividend of $.25 per common share to stockholders of record on February 8, 2006. On May 2, 2006, we instituted a regular quarterly cash dividend of $.10 per share, which we have since paid on each of May 26, August 18 and November 29, 2006 and February 20, 2007. At December 31, 2006, we had approximately $158 million of retained earnings available for distribution to stockholders under the most restrictive provisions of our debt agreements. Future dividends, if any, will only be paid at the discretion of our Board of Directors. In early 2004, we sold 11.5 million shares of common stock, consisting of approximately 1.7 million shares of treasury stock and 9.8 million newly issued shares. The net proceeds of approximately $265 million were retained for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. The treasury shares were acquired in the open market at various dates during 2000 2002 and had an average cost of $17.33 per share. Based on current and anticipated near term operating levels, we believe that operating cash flows together with existing working capital will be adequate to sustain planned capital expenditures and debt service and other requirements at least through the remainder of 2007. We currently have no other available credit facilities, but believe financing could be obtained if deemed necessary. 33 Table of Contents During the third quarter of 2005, we lost four offshore rigs, including the Rowan Halifax, and incurred significant damage on a fifth as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Since that time, we have been working to locate the lost or damaged rigs, salvage related equipment, remove debris, wreckage and pollutants from the water, mark or clear navigational hazards and clear rights of way. At December 31, 2006, we had incurred $87.5 million of costs related to such efforts, of which $42.2 million had been reimbursed through insurance, leaving $45.3 million included in Receivables. We have since received another $17.7 million of insurance reimbursements. We expect to incur additional costs in the near term to fulfill our obligations to remove wreckage and debris in amounts that may approach our expenditures to date. Such additional costs will depend on the extent and nature of work ultimately required and the duration thereof. Previously, we reported the filing of a lawsuit styled Rowan Companies, Inc. vs. Certain Underwriters at Lloyds and Insurance Companies Subscribing to Cover Note ARS 4183 in the 215th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas. The lawsuit was withdrawn following the agreement by such underwriters to reimburse us for the reasonable cost of removing wreckage and debris remaining on the drilling locations. Certain of our insurance underwriters at higher limits of liability have notified us that they are reserving their right to deny coverage for any costs incurred in wreckage and debris removal activities that they believe are outside the scope of their policy. We do not expect the costs will reach these higher limits until the second quarter of 2007, and are working to resolve this issue. Although the Company believes that it has adequate insurance coverage and will be reimbursed for costs incurred and to be incurred, it is possible that a portion of such costs will not be reimbursed, requiring a charge to future operations for any shortfall. We leased the jack up Rowan Halifax under a charter agreement that commenced in 1984 and was scheduled to expire in March 2008. The rig was insured for $43.4 million prior to being lost during Hurricane Rita in September 2005. We believe the insured value satisfied the requirements of the charter agreement, and by a margin sufficient to cover the $6.3 million carrying value of our equipment installed on the rig. However, the owner of the rig claimed that the rig should have been insured for its fair market value and sought recovery from us for compensation above the insured value. Thus, we assumed no insurance proceeds related to the Rowan Halifax and recorded a charge during the third quarter of 2005 for the full carrying value of our equipment. On November 3, 2005, we filed a declaratory judgment action styled Rowan Companies, Inc. vs. Textron Financial Corporation and Wilmington Trust Company as Owner Trustee of the Rowan Halifax 116 C Jack Up Rig in the 215th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas. The owner filed a similar declaratory judgment action, claiming a value of approximately $83 million for the rig. The owners motion for summary judgment was granted on January 25, 2007 which, unless overturned on appeal, would make us liable to the owner for the approximately $40 million difference between the owners claim and the insurance coverage, plus interest and costs. We continue to believe that our interpretation of the charter agreement is correct and intend to vigorously pursue an appeal to overturn the summary judgment ruling. During 2004, we learned that the Environmental and Natural Resources Division, Environmental Crimes Section of the U. S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had begun conducting a criminal investigation of environmental matters involving several of our offshore drilling rigs. Since that time, we have fully cooperated with the investigation, including responding to the DOJs subpoenas for certain documentation regarding our operations. The DOJ has a broad range of civil and criminal sanctions under environmental and other laws which it may pursue such as injunctive relief, fines (including multi million dollar fines), penalties and modifications to business practices and compliance programs. We have been engaged in discussions with the DOJ regarding a possible resolution of its investigation, including fines and additional sanctions against the Company. As a result of recent discussions with the DOJ, we expect to pay fines and environmental fund payments of $9 million and have recognized such amount as a charge to our fourth quarter 2006 operations. During 2005, we learned that the DOJ was conducting an investigation of potential antitrust violations among helicopter transportation providers in the Gulf of Mexico. Our former aviation subsidiary, which was sold effective December 31, 2004, received a subpoena in connection with the investigation. We have not been contacted by the DOJ, but the purchaser claimed that we are responsible for any exposure it may have. We have disputed that claim. We are involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to our businesses and are vigorously defending our position in all such matters. We believe that there are no other known contingencies, claims or lawsuits that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 34 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Management Estimates Rowans significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 43 of this Form 10 K. These policies, and management judgments, assumptions and estimates made in their application, underlie reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that Rowans most critical accounting policies and management estimates involve revenue recognition, primarily upfront service fees for equipment moves and modifications, long term manufacturing projects, property and depreciation, particularly capitalizable costs, useful lives and salvage values, and pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs, specifically assumptions used in actuarial calculations, as changes in such policies and or estimates would produce significantly different amounts from those reported herein. Revenue Recognition. Rowans drilling contracts generally provide for payment on a day rate basis, and revenues are recognized as the work progresses with the passage of time. We frequently receive lump sum payments at the outset of a drilling assignment as upfront service fees for equipment moves or modifications, and such payments (and related costs) are recognized as drilling revenues (and expenses) over the contract period. At December 31, 2006, we had deferred $60.9 million of revenues and $48.8 million of costs related to such upfront service fees, compared to $0.7 million and $2.7 million, respectively, one year earlier. We also typically receive reimbursement for certain rebillable costs, which are recognized as both revenues and expenses when incurred. Rowan generally recognizes manufacturing sales and related costs when title passes as products are shipped. Revenues from long term manufacturing projects such as rigs and rig kits are recognized on the percentage of completion basis using costs incurred relative to total estimated costs. We do not recognize any estimated profit until such projects are at least 10% complete, though a full provision is made immediately for any anticipated losses. Total estimated costs, which incorporate the latest manufacturing standards and engineering estimates, are critical to this process and are therefore reviewed on a regular basis. At December 31, 2006, we had received $179.8 million of progress payments toward in process long term manufacturing projects, of which $65.8 million had not yet been recognized as revenues. During 2006, we recognized $103.8 million of manufacturing revenues and $93.4 million of costs related to such projects on the percentage of completion basis, including an estimated $2.1 million loss on the rig construction project, compared to $36.1 million and $29.8 million, respectively, in 2005. Property and depreciation. We provide depreciation under the straight line method from the date an asset is placed into service based upon estimated service lives ranging up to 40 years and salvage values ranging up to 20%. We continue to operate 14 offshore rigs that were placed into service during 1972 1986 and assigned lives ranging from 12 to 15 years. Our newest and most significant assets, the Super Gorilla and Tarzan Class rigs, which collectively comprise almost two thirds of our property, plant and equipment carrying value, carry a 25 year service life. We continue to provide depreciation expense when our rigs are idle. Expenditures for new property or enhancements to existing property are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Capitalized cost includes labor expended during installation and, on newly constructed assets, a portion of interest cost incurred during the construction period. Long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable, such as following a sustained deficit in operating cash flows caused by a prominent decline in overall rig activity and average day rates. Pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs. As previously mentioned, our pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs are based upon actuarial computations that reflect our assumptions about future events, including long term asset returns, interest rates, annual compensation increases, mortality rates and other factors. Key assumptions at December 31, 2006 included discount rates ranging from 5.82% to 5.92%, an expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets of 8% and annual healthcare cost increases ranging from 10% in 2007 to 5% in 2011 and beyond. The assumed discount rate is based upon the average yield for Moodys Aa rated corporate bonds with maturities matched to expected benefit payments and the rate of return assumption reflects a probability distribution of expected long term returns that is weighted based upon plan asset allocations. A 1 percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase our recorded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities by approximately $83 million, while a 1% change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would change annual net benefits cost by approximately $3 million. The effects of a 1% change in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate are disclosed in Note 6 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 51 of this Form 10 K. 35 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements Our adoption, effective January 1, 2006, of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, which requires the measurement and recognition of stock based compensation expense based upon grant date fair value, reduced our net income by approximately $3.2 million or $.03 per share in 2006. Prior to 2006, we used the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. We estimate that the provisions of Statement 123R would have reduced (increased) reported amounts of net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share by $3.0 million or $.02 per diluted share in 2005 and $(3.1) million or $(.03) per diluted share in 2004. Our adoption, effective January 1, 2006, of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 151, Inventory Costs, which clarifies the distinction between costs that are allocable to inventory and those that are expensed as incurred, did not materially impact our financial position or results of operations. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, which requires that the funded status of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans be fully recognized in our December 31, 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet, had the effect of increasing our balances for Other liabilities, Deferred income taxes and Accumulated other comprehensive loss at that date by $67.1 million, $23.5 million and $43.6 million, respectively. Previously, balance sheet recognition was not required for items excluded from net pension and other benefits cost, including unamortized gains and losses, prior service cost and transition assets and liabilities, except where necessary to meet minimum liability thresholds, the after tax effect of which was reflected within Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). Under Statement 158, the unamortized portion of such items will continue to be excluded from net periodic benefits cost and included within other comprehensive income (loss). Our adoption, effective January 1, 2007, of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, which clarifies the measurement and financial statement recognition of the effects of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return, did not materially impact our financial position or results of operations. We have recorded an adjustment to reduce retained earnings on January 1, 2007 by approximately $2 million. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, which sets forth the Staffs views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements, did not materially affect our financial position or results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS Rowans outstanding debt at December 31, 2006 was comprised as follows: $313.6 million of fixed rate notes bearing a weighted average annual interest rate of 4.54% and $236.8 million of floating rate notes bearing a weighted average annual interest rate of 5.61%. Rowan believes that its exposure to risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates is limited in that the Company may fix the interest rate on its outstanding floating rate debt at any time. In addition, the majority of Rowans transactions are carried out in United States dollars; thus, the Companys foreign currency exposure is not material. Fluctuating commodity prices affect Rowans future earnings materially to the extent that they influence demand for the Companys products and services. Rowan does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments. 36 Table of Contents
