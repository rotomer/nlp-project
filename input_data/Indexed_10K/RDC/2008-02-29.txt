ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table highlights Rowans operating results for the years indicated (in millions): 2007 2006 2005 Revenues: Drilling $ 1,382.6 $ 1,067.4 $ 775.4 Manufacturing: Drilling products and systems 498.6 241.0 105.1 Mining, forestry and steel products 213.8 202.3 188.3 Total manufacturing 712.4 443.3 293.4 Total revenues $ 2,095.0 $ 1,510.7 $ 1,068.8 Operating income: Drilling $ 661.8 $ 447.7 $ 332.9 Manufacturing: Drilling products and systems 43.0 23.5 (7.8 ) Mining, forestry and steel products 29.1 14.5 15.5 Total manufacturing 72.1 38.0 7.7 Total operating income $ 733.9 $ 485.7 $ 340.6 Income from continuing operations $ 483.8 $ 317.0 $ 217.8 Income from discontinued operations $ $ 1.2 $ 12.0 Net income $ 483.8 $ 318.2 $ 229.8 As indicated in the preceding table, Rowans results of operations are heavily dependent upon the performance of our drilling division, which comprises about 94% of our fixed assets and, over the past three years, has generated 69% of our aggregate revenues and 92% of our aggregate operating income. Our manufacturing operations, featuring our Drilling Products and Systems segment, have led the strategic expansion and upgrade of our drilling fleet over the past decade and, in recent years, has expanded product lines and improved contributions to our operating results, as is demonstrated above with revenue increases exceeding 50% in each of the past two years and meaningful increases in profitability. The performance of each of our continuing operations over the 2005 2007 period is discussed more fully below. The amounts shown in the table above for Income from discontinued operations reflect the aggregate after tax results of our aviation and boat operations for each of the past three years, including a $13.1 million after tax gain recognized on the sale of our boat purchase options in 2005. See Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 75 of this Form 10 K for further information regarding the Companys discontinued operations. Drilling Operations Rowans drilling operating results are a function of rig activity and day rates in our principal operating areas, which are offshore in the Middle East, Gulf of Mexico, the North Sea, eastern Canada and, beginning in 2008, West Africa, and onshore in several Gulf Coast states and Alaska. In 2006 and 2007, we significantly expanded our presence in the Middle East and will have nine jack up rigs or 43% of our offshore fleet in that market by the second quarter of 2008. We are selective in pursuing work in other overseas markets where our premium and harsh environment jack up rigs are well suited, and seek opportunities to maximize long term returns. 27 Table of Contents Rig activity and day rates are primarily determined by energy company exploration and development expenditures, which are heavily influenced by oil and natural gas prices, and the availability of competitive equipment. Day rates generally follow the trend in rig activity and, due to intense competition pervasive in the contract drilling industry, both measures have historically declined much faster than they have risen. In recent years, global demand for oil and natural gas has increased in order to fuel growing economies, especially in developing nations like China and India. At the same time, many key producers have increasingly struggled with depleting reserves, requiring more drilling simply to maintain current production levels. These market forces have caused a dramatic increase in oil and natural gas prices. Marginal drilling projects that were deemed uneconomical a few years ago with oil at $25 per barrel or gas at $3 per mcf, are considered worth the additional risk at prices well above $50 and $5, respectively. At the same time, the global jack up fleet has continued to age, with the average rig now more than 20 years old. These trends caused a surge in worldwide drilling activity beginning in 2005, with all available rigs benefitting. More recently, however, we have begun to see a bifurcation of the jack up market emerging, with newer and more capable rigs being marketed throughout the world, maintaining more consistent utilization and commanding higher day rates, while opportunities for older and less capable commodity rigs have become more limited. Our rig fleets consist currently of 21 offshore jack up rigs and 29 land rigs. Our offshore fleet features three Gorilla class jack ups built during the early 1980s, four Super Gorilla class jack ups constructed during the 1998 2003 period, and three Tarzan Class jack ups delivered in the 2004 2006 period. Nine additional jack ups are under construction or on order with deliveries expected over the 2008 2011 period. Our land fleet includes 12 newly constructed rigs, four rigs built during 2001 2002 and 11 rigs that have been refurbished in recent years. Two additional land rigs are expected to be completed during 2008. For much of our history, our offshore drilling operations have been focused in the Gulf of Mexico, where eight of our offshore rigs are currently deployed. This market is extremely fragmented among many oil and gas companies, many of whom are independent operators whose drilling activities are often highly dependent upon near term operating cash flows. A typical drilling assignment may call for 30 60 days of exploration or development work, performed under a single well contract with negotiable renewal options. Long term contracts have been rare, and generally are available only from the major integrated oil companies and a few of the larger independent operators. Thus, drilling activity and day rates in this market have tended to fluctuate rather quickly, and generally follow trends in natural gas prices. Under these market conditions, Rowan generally avoided long term commitments in the past unless they provided opportunities for rate adjustments in the future. As discussed more fully below, high natural gas prices and the continued migration of rigs to foreign markets in recent years, coupled with the significant loss of equipment during the 2005 hurricanes, created a jack up supply deficit in the Gulf of Mexico in 2006. As a result, rig day rates, which increased dramatically in late 2005, continued to set new records during 2006 and early 2007, and the occasional term drilling contract, ranging from six months to two years, became available for certain high specification rigs. These opportunities have been more prevalent in other markets, however, and Gulf of Mexico market conditions have since weakened, especially for less capable rigs. In anticipation of these factors, we had begun to focus our marketing efforts in the Middle East, the North Sea and other foreign areas beginning in 2005, and currently have two thirds of our jack up rigs committed to markets outside the Gulf of Mexico. The Middle East market has been a primary focus for our drilling operations since late 2005, when we obtained a three year contract from Saudi Aramco for four of our jack up rigs offshore Saudi Arabia. The 116C class jack ups Rowan Middletown, Charles Rowan, Arch Rowan and Rowan California departed the Gulf of Mexico in January 2006 and commenced operations in the Persian Gulf in April. In 2007, we added four rigs to this market: a two year contract for Maersk offshore Qatar with 116C class jack ups Rowan Paris and Gilbert Rowe which began in late January and a four year contract for Saudi Aramco with Tarzan Class jack ups Scooter Yeargain and Hank Boswell which began in late March. The Tarzan Class jack up Bob Keller recently departed the Gulf of Mexico for a three year assignment for Saudi Aramco which should begin in the second quarter of 2008. The North Sea is a mature, harsh environment offshore drilling market that has long been dominated by major oil and gas companies operating within a relatively tight regulatory environment. Project lead times are often lengthy and drilling assignments, which typically require ultra premium equipment capable of handling extreme 28 Table of Contents weather conditions and high down hole pressures and temperatures, can range from several months to several years. Thus, drilling activity and day rates in the North Sea move slowly in response to market conditions, and generally follow trends in oil prices. Our North Sea operations currently include our Super Gorilla class jack ups Gorilla V, Gorilla VI and Gorilla VII. The Gorilla V commitment should extend into the third quarter of 2010 while Gorilla VI is currently committed through the first quarter of 2010. The Gorilla VII recently obtained a two year commitment offshore Angola that should begin in the second quarter of 2008. We have operated offshore eastern Canada at varying levels since the early 1980s, and our presence there peaked at three fully utilized rigs in mid 2000. More recently, demand for harsh environment jack ups in the area has been sporadic. The departure of the Gorilla VI in late 2006 left us with no ongoing drilling operations there, though one of our Gorilla class rigs will return to eastern Canada for a minimum six month assignment beginning in mid to late 2009. Rowan has never cold stacked its drilling rigs during slack periods as we believe the long term costs of retraining personnel and restarting equipment negates any short term savings. Thus, our drilling expenses have not typically fluctuated with rig activity, though they have increased as our rig fleets have been expanded and relocated. Rig fleet additions over the past three years have included the Tarzan Class jack ups Hank Boswell (September 2006) and Bob Keller (August 2005), twelve new land rigs delivered in 2006 (8 rigs) and 2007 (4 rigs) and two existing land rigs that were refurbished during 2005. 2007 Compared to 2006 The following table highlights the performance of our drilling division during 2007 compared to 2006 (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 1,382.6 100 $ 1,067.4 100 Operating costs (591.4 ) (43 ) (504.9 ) (47 ) Depreciation expense (101.8 ) (7 ) (77.5 ) (7 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (68.3 ) (5 ) (56.5 ) (5 ) Gains on property disposals and other 40.7 3 19.2 2 Operating income $ 661.8 48 $ 447.7 43 Drilling revenues increased by $315.2 million or 30% in 2007, due primarily to the effects of increased average day rates and drilling activity, as follows (in millions): Increases in average day rates $ 140.8 New or reactivated rigs 124.3 Net increase in activity for relocated rigs 77.8 Decrease in rebillable expenses (18.8 ) Other, primarily reduced activity for existing rigs (8.9 ) Total increase $ 315.2 Our overall offshore fleet utilization was 94% in 2007, up from 86% in 2006, when several rigs were being prepared for long term assignments overseas. We compute rig utilization as revenue producing days divided by total available rig days. Our average offshore day rate was $156,200 in 2007, an increase of approximately 11% over 2006. Average day rates are determined as recorded revenues, excluding rebilled expenses, divided by revenue producing days. Total revenue producing days offshore increased by 1,154 or 19% between years, with over one half of that increase associated with the relocated rigs. 29 Table of Contents Oil prices continued their upward ascent to record levels in 2007, increasing consistently throughout the year from the upper $50s per barrel in January to the mid $90s in December. Thus, many foreign markets like the Middle East continued to pursue high specification jack ups with long term contracts at historic rates. During early 2007, four of our rigs commenced operations in the Middle East under multi year contracts following their relocation from the Gulf of Mexico. Our eight jack ups working offshore Saudi Arabia and Qatar collectively generated approximately $400 million of drilling revenues in 2007, averaging almost $149,000 per day. Demand for harsh environment equipment in the North Sea remained strong during the year enabling us to keep our rigs fully utilized and increase our contracted backlog in that market. Gorilla V was 99% utilized there in 2007 and generated almost $173,000 per day in drilling revenues during the year. Gorilla VII was 95% utilized in the North Sea market in 2007 and averaged more than $257,000 per day there in drilling revenues during the year. After relocating from Canada in early 2007, Gorilla VI was 100% utilized in the North Sea and averaged more than $302,000 per day there in drilling revenues during the remainder of the year. Our collective North Sea drilling operations generated approximately $246 million of drilling revenues in 2007, averaging more than $241,000 per day. Gorilla III was 100% utilized offshore Trinidad in 2007 and generated more than $76 million of drilling revenues, or almost $209,000 per day. The following table summarizes average natural gas prices and our Gulf of Mexico fleet utilization and average day rates during the year: Natural Average Average Gas (MCF)* Utilization Day Rate First quarter 2007 $ 7.17 98 % $ 127,700 Second quarter 2007 7.66 92 % 123,800 Third quarter 2007 6.24 98 % 132,100 Fourth quarter 2007 7.39 94 % 133,300 Full year 2007 7.12 96 % 129,300 Full year 2006 6.98 91 % 138,800 * Source: New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) Natural gas prices remained at historically high levels throughout 2007, though fluctuating weather conditions and high storage levels contributed to price weakness during the third quarter and reduced drilling demand in the Gulf of Mexico and throughout the United States. Thus, the migration of many competitive jack ups from the Gulf of Mexico continued throughout 2007. Most of the available rigs that remained in the area encountered tougher competition for fewer drilling assignments and, as a result, declining day rates. Our six month to two year term commitments for four of our nine Gulf of Mexico rigs Bob Palmer, Gorilla II, Gorilla IV and Bob Keller helped to insulate Rowan from the impact of weakening demand. As shown in the preceding table, our average Gulf of Mexico day rate decreased by $9,500 or 7% during 2007. The four rigs mentioned above were collectively 95% utilized in 2007 and averaged more than $180,000 per day in drilling revenues during the year, with only the Bob Palmer experiencing downtime as a result of contractually required modifications. The Rowan Louisiana, which was severely damaged in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina, returned to service in the Gulf of Mexico in December 2006, and was 100% utilized in 2007. Our total revenue producing days in the Gulf of Mexico decreased by 777 or 20% in 2007 due to the rig relocations that occurred over the past two years. Our 29 deep well land rigs in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Alaska generally withstood the weakening domestic market conditions during 2007, and attained 95% utilization and an average day rate of $22,800 during the year, compared to 97% and $22,600 in 2006. The fleet included twelve new 2000 horsepower rigs that were constructed during the past two years which contributed to a 2,497 or 36% increase in revenue producing days in 2007. Two additional new land rigs are currently under construction and expected to be delivered during the first half of 2008. 30 Table of Contents Drilling operating costs increased by $86.5 million or 17% in 2007 compared to 2006, due primarily to effects of the following (in millions): New or reactivated rigs Hank Boswell (September 2006), Rowan Louisiana (December 2006) and twelve land rigs $ 57.9 Rebillable expenses for existing rigs primarily rig relocation costs decreased by 54% (25.9 ) Compensation costs for existing rigs and related benefits 18.6 Towing costs primarily international rig moves increased by 255% 13.4 Repairs and maintenance for existing rigs increased by 14% 11.1 All other 11.4 Total increase $ 86.5 Depreciation expense incurred by our drilling operations increased by $24.3 million or 31% in 2007, due primarily to the addition of the rigs noted above. Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $11.8 million or 21% in 2007, due primarily to incremental incentive compensation costs associated with our improved financial results. Our drilling operations realized $40.7 million of gains on asset disposals during 2007, including a $14.1 million gain in connection with the sale of our Alaska based drilling camps and a $23.4 million gain related to the installment sale of the Rowan Midland and related equipment. The net gain for 2006 was $28.2 million, most of which related to the installment sale of the Rowan Midland and related equipment. Our 2006 operating results also included a $9.0 million charge in the fourth quarter for fines and community service payments made in 2007 in settlement of criminal charges stemming from a Department of Justice criminal investigation of environmental matters involving several of our offshore drilling rigs. This matter is discussed more fully under LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES: Contingent Liabilities beginning on page 42. 2006 Compared to 2005 The following table highlights the performance of our drilling division during 2006 compared to 2005 (dollars in millions): 2006 2005 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 1,067.4 100 $ 775.4 100 Operating costs (504.9 ) (47 ) (388.3 ) (50 ) Depreciation expense (77.5 ) (7 ) (69.4 ) (9 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (56.5 ) (5 ) (51.6 ) (7 ) Gains on property disposals and other 19.2 2 66.8 9 Operating income $ 447.7 43 $ 332.9 43 Drilling revenues increased by $292.0 million or 38% in 2006, due primarily to the effects of increased average day rates between periods, which more than offset the net impact of changes in our rigs fleets and reduced drilling activity for relocating rigs, as follows (in millions): Increases in average day rates $ 357.3 Rigs lost/damaged in 2005 hurricanes (75.4 ) Rigs sold (28.8 ) New rigs 28.0 Increase in rebillable expenses 23.9 Other, primarily reduced activity for relocating rigs (13.0 ) Total increase $ 292.0 31 Table of Contents Our overall offshore fleet utilization was 86% in 2006, down from 96% in 2005, as several rigs were being prepared for long term assignments overseas. We compute rig utilization as revenue producing days divided by total available rig days. Our average offshore day rate was $141,500 in 2006, an increase of approximately 81% over 2005. Average day rates are determined as recorded revenues, excluding rebilled expenses, divided by revenue producing days. Total revenue producing days declined by just over 1,000 or 7% between years, with much of that decrease associated with the rigs that were being prepared for long term assignments overseas. Natural gas prices remained at historically high levels throughout 2006, though mild weather contributed to a decline from the record average prices experienced during 2005. The migration of competitive jack ups from the Gulf of Mexico continued during 2006, which enabled higher rates for those rigs that remained in the area, and our day rates easily surpassed our all time high levels. The following table summarizes average natural gas prices and our Gulf of Mexico fleet utilization and average day rates during the year: Natural Average Average Gas (MCF)* Utilization Day Rate First quarter 2006 $ 7.84 96 % $ 123,500 Second quarter 2006 6.65 96 % 143,500 Third quarter 2006 6.18 88 % 150,600 Fourth quarter 2006 7.24 83 % 140,300 Full year 2006 6.98 91 % 138,800 Full year 2005 9.02 97 % 71,100 * Source: New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) As shown in the preceding table, our average Gulf of Mexico day rate increased by 95% in 2006, though rates began to weaken somewhat during the fourth quarter. The onset of the hurricane season in June dampened overall drilling activity during the third quarter, forcing available rigs to compete for fewer, shallow water opportunities, and many operators had exhausted much of their drilling budgets before the end of the year. Our third Tarzan Class jack up, the Hank Boswell, was delivered and commenced operations in the Gulf of Mexico in September 2006. The Rowan Louisiana, which was severely damaged in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina, was returned to service in December 2006. Eight rigs either began or ended the year mobilizing from the Gulf of Mexico: four rigs commenced operations in Saudi Arabia in April 2006, two rigs began drilling in Qatar in January 2007 and two additional rigs, including the Hank Boswell, were in the shipyard preparing to relocate to Saudi Arabia at year end. In addition, the Gorilla III left the Gulf of Mexico in August and began work in Trinidad in September. As a result, our total revenue producing days in the Gulf of Mexico decreased by 3,479 or 47% during 2006. Spot oil prices continued to set records in 2006. Prices on the NYMEX traded between $55 and $70 per barrel for almost the entire year, reaching an all time high of $77 per barrel in July, and ended the year at around $60. Thus, many foreign markets like the Middle East continued to lure jack ups from the Gulf of Mexico with long term contracts at attractive rates. Our four jack ups working offshore Saudi Arabia generated approximately $115 million of drilling revenues in 2006, averaging more than $113,000 per day. Demand for harsh environment equipment in the North Sea improved during the year enabling us to keep our rigs fully utilized and, as noted previously, increase our contracted backlog in the area. Gorilla V was 95% utilized in the UK sector of the North Sea in 2006 and generated more than $138,000 per day in drilling revenues during the year. Gorilla VII was 98% utilized offshore Denmark in 2006 and averaged more than $198,000 per day there in drilling revenues during the year. Gorilla VI was 85% utilized and generated almost $184,000 per day in drilling revenues offshore eastern Canada during 2006. Gorilla III was relocated from the Gulf of Mexico to Trinidad during the third quarter of 2006, where the rig was fully utilized and averaged more than $186,000 per day in drilling revenues during the remainder of the year. Our 25 land rigs were 97% utilized in Texas, Louisiana and Oklahoma in 2006, and achieved an average day rate of $22,600 during the year, compared to 98% and $18,400 in 2005. The fleet included eight of twelve new 2000 32 Table of Contents horsepower rigs that were constructed during the year. One additional new land rig was completed in early 2007 and the remaining three rigs are expected to be delivered during the first and third quarters of 2007. Ten of the twelve new rigs have been contracted for terms ranging from two to three years. Drilling operating costs increased by $115.9 million or 30% in 2006 compared to 2005, due to effects of the following (in millions): Insurance increased by 355% $ 37.0 Rebillable expenses primarily rig relocation charges increased by 90% 23.9 Repairs and maintenance for existing rigs increased by 28% 17.0 New rigs primarily Bob Keller (September 2005), Hank Boswell (September 2006) and eight land rigs 14.5 Labor costs increased by 8% 11.2 All other 13.0 Total increase $ 116.6 Depreciation expense incurred by our drilling operations increased by $8.1 million or 12% in 2006, due primarily to the addition of the rigs noted above. Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $4.9 million or 9% in 2006, due primarily to additional incentive compensation costs following the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R. Drilling operating income in 2006 included $28.2 million of gains on asset disposals during the year, $24.5 million of which related to the installment sale of the Rowan Midland and related equipment, compared to $66.8 million in 2005, which resulted from both asset disposals and the net excess insurance recoveries related to our losses during Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Our 2006 operating results also included a $9 million charge for fines and community service payments made in 2007 in settlement of criminal charges stemming from a Department of Justice criminal investigation of environmental matters involving several of our offshore drilling rigs. This matter is discussed more fully under LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES: Contingent Liabilities beginning on page 42. Outlook Worldwide rig demand is inherently volatile and has historically varied from one market to the next, as has the supply of competitive equipment. Exploration and development expenditures are affected by many local factors, such as political and regulatory policies, seasonal weather patterns, lease expirations, new oil and gas discoveries and reservoir depletion. In the end, however, the level and expected direction of oil and natural gas prices are what most impact drilling activity, and oil and gas prices are ultimately a function of the supply of and demand for those commodities. With consistently high prices in recent years, most energy companies have realized substantial cash flows while also struggling to sustain production and replace reserves. We believe, therefore, that investments will continue to be made in additional drilling projects throughout the world. Currently, the worldwide jack up market appears to be as strong as its ever been, with over 90% of the competitive fleet under contract. In addition, the expected demand for jack ups exceeds the current supply of rigs in the Middle East, Southeast Asia, West Africa and the Mediterranean. We believe that these markets will absorb many of the more than 80 newbuild jack up rigs scheduled for delivery during 2008 2011, though the migration of high specification drilling equipment from mature jack up markets like the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea may also continue in the near term. Our long term contracts obtained over the past two years in the Middle East, North Sea and West Africa have brought significantly more global diversification and revenue visibility to our drilling operations and we will continue to pursue overseas assignments that we believe will maximize the contribution of our offshore rigs and enhance our operating results. The 2005 hurricanes caused tremendous damage to drilling and production equipment and facilities throughout the Gulf Coast, and we suffered a significant loss of prospective revenues from the total destruction of four rigs. During 2006, there was a noticeable decline in demand for drilling equipment that coincided with the onset of hurricane season in June and grew more pronounced as growing natural gas inventories caused prices to weaken 33 Table of Contents during the third and early fourth quarters. This ultimately forced jack up contractors, including Rowan, to accept reduced rates in certain cases in order to keep less capable rigs fully utilized. These conditions reduced drilling opportunities during hurricane season and natural gas price volatility were repeated in 2007, and utilization and day rates for available rigs weakened further over the last half of the year. Currently, Gulf of Mexico rig demand remains well below peak 2006 levels, but appears to be recovering. We are especially encouraged by early 2008 developments in the ultra deep gas market; specifically, our contract to re enter the Blackbeard Prospect with the Gorilla IV and the commencement of drilling on the Eldorado Prospect by the Bob Palmer. This increased global demand for drilling equipment in recent years has led to greater requirements for parts, supplies and people, which have in turn increased the cost of each. In addition, drilling equipment running near capacity for extended periods ultimately requires more extensive maintenance and repairs. We expect these inflationary pressures to continue in 2008 which, unless we are able to recover the increased costs through higher day rates, will impair our future operating results. In addition, the cost of insurance in the Gulf of Mexico is significantly higher than it was in 2005. Though we were recently able to obtain rate reductions for our offshore operations and fleet, the cost of our coverage is still much higher than the pre storm level even after we assumed more of the risk of certain losses. Our relocation of rigs from the Gulf of Mexico has helped to offset the increase in insurance rates. Thus, our drilling operations are currently benefiting from predominantly favorable market conditions worldwide and are profitable. There is no assurance, however, that such conditions will be sustained beyond the near term or that our drilling operations will remain profitable. The market may not be able to fully absorb the more than 80 jack ups currently under construction or on order, and our drilling operations will be adversely affected if market conditions otherwise deteriorate. Additionally, as previously reported, we have recently committed to build six additional jack up rigs over the next three years, giving us nine total rigs either under construction or on order at present. We currently anticipate funding construction of all these rigs through operating cash flows, but will consider attractive financing alternatives. If market conditions deteriorate, our cash flows may be insufficient, and we could be forced to accept unfavorable financing terms in order to complete construction. Manufacturing Operations We have manufacturing facilities in Longview and Houston, Texas and Vicksburg, Mississippi that collectively produce mining, timber and transportation equipment, alloy steel and steel plate, and drilling rigs and various rig components under two operating segments: Drilling Products and Systems and Mining, Forestry and Steel Products. In prior years, Rowan reported one manufacturing segment and that information has been adjusted to conform to the current year presentation. The Drilling Products and Systems segment provides equipment, parts and services for the drilling industry. Featured products include complete jack up rigs, rig kits and component packages, primary drilling equipment such as mud pumps, drawworks, top drives, rotary tables, electrical components such as variable speed motors and drives. The segment built the first offshore jack up drilling rig in 1955 and has designed or built more than 200 rigs since, including all 21 in our fleet. During 2007, Drilling Products and Systems completed construction of a jack up rig for Perforadora Central, a Mexican drilling contractor, provided the jack up kit and much of the drilling equipment for our fourth Tarzan Class rig, the J. P. Bussell, made significant construction progress on the first of our latest jack up design, the 240C class, and began construction of the second 240C rig. The Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment produces large wheeled mining and timber equipment and related parts and carbon and alloy steel and steel plate. 34 Table of Contents 2007 Compared to 2006 The following table highlights the performance of our Drilling Products and Systems segment during 2007 compared to 2006 (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 498.6 100 $ 241.0 100 Operating costs (426.6 ) (86 ) (201.1 ) (83 ) Depreciation expense (11.7 ) (2 ) (8.1 ) (3 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (17.2 ) (3 ) (8.5 ) (4 ) Gains on property disposals and other (0.1 ) 0.2 Operating income $ 43.0 9 $ 23.5 10 Our Drilling Products and Systems segment achieved an aggregate $257.6 million or 107% increase in revenues in 2007, which featured the following: $148.3 million associated with 13 land rigs and component packages shipped in 2007, up from $7.7 million in 2006; $116.9 million recognized on eight rig kit projects in 2007, up from $36.0 million in 2006; $49.8 million from 70 mud pumps shipped in 2007, up from $44.3 million and 69 pumps in 2006; $41.6 million recognized on the external rig construction project which was completed in June 2007, down from $67.7 million recognized in 2006; $33.4 million related to drive and control system packages, up from $13.4 million in 2006; $27.9 million from custom fabrication work, up from $18.5 million in 2006; and $15.2 million from 271 motors shipped in 2007, up from $9.6 million in 2006. Our 2007 Drilling Products and Systems operating results included a $15.8 million loss on the external rig construction project which required many more labor hours than we originally anticipated. Efforts made in late 2006 and early 2007 to deliver the Hank Boswell three months ahead of schedule, rebuild the Rowan Louisiana and assist with contractually required modifications to our Middle East rigs had the effect of delaying progress on the external rig construction project. Thus, as is shown in the preceding table, our average margin on operating costs decreased to 14% of revenues in 2007 from 17% in 2006. Depreciation expense incurred by Drilling Products and Systems in 2007 increased by $3.6 million or 44% over 2006, due to machinery, equipment and building additions to expand capacity at our manufacturing facilities. Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $8.7 million or 102% in 2007, due to higher selling related expenses and incremental staffing required to facilitate the growth in operations discussed immediately above and increased amounts of professional fees and other shared administrative costs that are allocated between our manufacturing segments based upon revenues. Our 2007 Drilling Products and Systems operating results shown in the preceding table exclude the effects of the approximately $263 million of products and services provided at cost to our drilling division during the year, most of which was attributable to construction progress on the J. P. Bussell, the two 240C class jack ups and the six new land rigs. 35 Table of Contents The following table highlights the performance of our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment during 2007 compared to 2006 (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 213.8 100 $ 202.3 100 Operating costs (169.9 ) (79 ) (171.1 ) (85 ) Depreciation expense (5.3 ) (2 ) (4.3 ) (2 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (9.4 ) (5 ) (13.2 ) (7 ) Gains on property disposals and other (0.1 ) 0.8 1 Operating income $ 29.1 14 $ 14.5 7 Our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment achieved an aggregate $11.5 million or 6% increase in revenues in 2007. Shipments of mining loaders and forestry stackers totaled 30 units in 2007, down from 35 units in 2006, though 13 were the larger L 1850 and L 2350 models which carry a higher selling price. Total equipment revenues were $94.9 million in 2007, down by $6.1 million or 6% from 2006. Parts sales were a record $62.6 million in 2007, an improvement of $4.6 million or 8% from 2006. Steel shipments totaled 52,900 tons in 2007, up by 10,800 tons or 26% over 2006, and the mix changed from 40% external in 2006 to 51% external in 2007, yielding a 63% increase in external volume and an $18.1 million or 78% increase in plate revenues between periods. Our 2006 Mining, Forestry and Steel Products operating results included $7.8 million in environmental remediation costs incurred following detection of traces of radioactive material at our steel mill. Thus, as is shown in the preceding table, our average margin on operating costs increased to 21% of revenues in 2007 from 15% in 2006. Depreciation expense incurred by Mining, Forestry and Steel Products in 2007 increased by $1.0 million or 23% from 2006, due to the expansion of our steel mill along with machinery and equipment additions to increase capacity at our manufacturing facilities. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased by $3.8 million or 29% in 2007, due primarily to reduced amounts of professional fees and other shared administrative costs that are allocated between our manufacturing segments based upon revenues. 2006 Compared to 2005 The following table highlights the performance of our Drilling Products and Systems segment during 2006 compared to 2005 (dollars in millions): 2006 2005 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 241.0 100 $ 105.1 100 Operating costs (201.1 ) (83 ) (99.3 ) (94 ) Depreciation expense (8.1 ) (3 ) (6.1 ) (6 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (8.5 ) (4 ) (6.9 ) (7 ) Losses on property disposals and other 0.2 (0.6 ) Operating income $ 23.5 10 $ (7.8 ) (7 ) Our Drilling Products and Systems segment achieved an aggregate $135.9 million or 129% increase in revenues in 2006, which featured the following: $103.7 million recognized on long term rig and rig kit construction projects in 2006, up from $36.1 million in 2005; $44.3 million from 69 mud pumps shipped in 2006, up from $25.4 million and 39 pumps in 2005; $13.4 million related to drive and control system packages; $9.6 million from new motor shipments; and $7.7 million associated with land rigs and component packages. 36 Table of Contents The increased rig and kit construction revenues contributed significantly to the higher average margin on operating costs as shown in the preceding table. Efforts by Drilling Products and Systems to deliver the Hank Boswell almost three months ahead of schedule caused it to incur additional costs on the external rig construction project at Vicksburg, and our 2006 operating results included a $2.1 million charge for the estimated loss on that project. Depreciation expense incurred by Drilling Products and Systems in 2006 increased by $2.0 million or 33% over 2005, due to machinery, equipment and building additions to expand capacity at our manufacturing facilities. Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $1.6 million or 23% in 2006, due to higher selling related expenses and increased amounts of professional fees and other shared administrative costs that are allocated between our manufacturing segments based upon revenues. Our 2006 Drilling Products and Systems operating results shown in the preceding table exclude the effects of the approximately $230 million of products and services provided at cost to our drilling division during the year, most of which was attributable to completion of our third Tarzan Class jack up, the Hank Boswell, and construction progress on our fourth Tarzan Class jack up, the J. P. Bussell. The following table highlights the performance of our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment during 2006 compared to 2005 (dollars in millions): 2006 2005 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 202.3 100 $ 188.3 100 Operating costs (171.1 ) (85 ) (154.4 ) (82 ) Depreciation expense (4.3 ) (2 ) (5.7 ) (3 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (13.2 ) (7 ) (12.9 ) (7 ) Gains (losses) on property disposals and other 0.8 1 0.2 Operating income $ 14.5 7 $ 15.5 8 Our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment achieved an aggregate $14.0 million or 7% increase in revenues in 2006. Shipments of mining loaders and forestry stackers totaled 35 units in 2006, up from 34 units in 2005. Total equipment revenues were $101.1 million in 2006, up by $9.7 million or 11% from 2005. In addition, parts sales improved by $15.3 million or 34% between periods. Steel shipments totaled 42,100 tons in 2006, up by 3,800 tons or 10% over 2005, though the mix changed from 59% external in 2005 to 40% external in 2006, which yielded a 27% decrease in external volume and a $7.6 million or 25% decrease in plate revenues between periods. During 2006, we incurred $7.8 million of costs during the last half of the year to collect and dispose of a radioactive material that was released while processing scrap at our steel mill. Thus, as is shown in the preceding table, our average margin on operating costs decreased to 15% of revenues in 2006 from 18% in 2005. Depreciation expense incurred by Mining, Forestry and Steel Products in 2006 decreased by $1.4 million or 25% from 2006 as machining capacity in our Longview, Texas facility was reallocated to the Drilling Products and Systems segment. Similarly, Selling, general and administrative costs incurred in 2006 were virtually unchanged from 2005, as higher selling related expenses were offset by reduced amounts of professional fees and other shared administrative costs that are allocated between our manufacturing segments based upon revenues. Outlook Though less volatile than our drilling operations, our manufacturing operations are impacted by world commodities prices; in particular, prices for copper, iron ore, coal and gold. In addition, the prospects for our Drilling Products and Systems segment are closely tied to the condition of the overall drilling industry and its demand for equipment, parts and services. Many commodity prices continue to be at or near historically high levels due to strong worldwide demand. 37 Table of Contents Our external manufacturing backlog, which consists of executed contracts and customer commitments, was approximately $348 million at December 31, 2007, compared to $530 million at December 31, 2006, and included $295 million from Drilling Products and Systems. The backlog featured $151 million related to seven long term rig kit construction projects in process that are expected to run through early 2009, $92 million associated with nine land rigs and component packages that should be delivered in 2008 and the remaining $105 million related to mining loaders, log stackers, ad hoc drilling equipment and related parts orders that we expect to fulfill during 2008. The backlog was down by approximately 34% from the prior year end level due primarily to progress on long term rig or rig kit construction projects during 2007, including the $130 million external rig construction project which was completed in June. Thus far, we have been able to pass along the effects of raw material and labor cost increases to our customers in the form of higher sales prices. We are optimistic that commodity prices will remain firm, sustaining the demand for the types of equipment and services that we provide, and that our increased volumes will yield improved profitability. We cannot, however, accurately predict the duration of current business conditions or their impact on our operations. It is possible that the drop in backlog discussed above is indicative of decreasing demand for our manufactured products. Our manufacturing operations will be adversely affected if conditions deteriorate. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Key balance sheet amounts and ratios for 2007 and 2006 were as follows (dollars in millions): DECEMBER 31, 2007 2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 284.5 $ 258.0 Current assets $ 1,303.0 $ 1,102.8 Current liabilities $ 495.6 $ 516.7 Current ratio 2.63 2.13 Current maturities of long term debt $ 64.9 $ 64.9 Long term debt $ 420.5 $ 485.4 Stockholders equity $ 2,348.4 $ 1,874.0 Long term debt/total capitalization .15 .21 Reflected in the comparison above are the effects of the following sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents in 2007, with comparable amounts for 2006: SOURCES (USES) OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS 2007 2006 Net operating cash flows $ 432.6 $ 292.1 Net change in restricted cash balance 106.1 (156.1 ) Net proceeds from asset disposals 45.8 39.1 Proceeds from equity compensation and debenture plans 13.2 9.2 Capital expenditures (462.6 ) (479.1 ) Debt repayments (64.9 ) (64.9 ) Cash dividend payments (44.4 ) (60.5 ) All other 0.7 2.3 Total sources (uses) $ 26.5 $ (417.9 ) Operating Cash Flows Operating cash flows in 2007 included non cash or non operating adjustments to our net income totaling $162.3 million, less a net investment in working capital of $225.3 million. Non cash or non operating adjustments included depreciation expense of $118.8 million, deferred income taxes of $51.2 million, compensation expense of $9.3 million and net retirement plan expenses in excess of funding of $23.5 million, partially offset by net gains on asset disposals of $40.5 million. Working capital grew in 2007 with additional investments in trade receivables and inventories of $111.3 million and $59.0 million, respectively, coupled with reductions in trade payables and 38 Table of Contents deferred revenues of $57.1 million and $35.6 million respectively. Receivables grew in 2007 in line with revenues and inventories were increased in order to position our manufacturing operations for further growth. The decline in trade payables and deferred revenues during 2007 reflects progress made during the year on long term manufacturing projects and the comparative lack of in process rig mobilizations and related customer advances toward future drilling services at year end. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures in 2007 included $62.2 million towards construction of our fourth Tarzan Class jack up rig, the J.P. Bussell. Another shipyard is constructing the hull of the J. P. Bussell and we expect the rig to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2008. We currently expect to continue funding construction of the J. P. Bussell from available cash. See further discussion below under Contingent Liabilities. Capital expenditures during 2007 also included $114.8 million for progress towards the construction of the first of two 240C class jack up rigs, named the Rowan Mississippi, at our Vicksburg, Mississippi shipyard. Another $43.3 million was expended during 2007 on the second 240C rig, named the Ralph Coffman. The 240C class will be equipped for high pressure/high temperature drilling in water depths of up to 400 feet. The 240 C was designed to be a significant upgrade of the original 116C class, which has been the workhorse of the global drilling industry since its introduction in the late 1970s. The 240C will have more deck space, higher variable load, more drilling (hook load) capacity, more cantilever reach and greater personnel capacity than the 116C. Each rig is expected to cost approximately $200 million and be completed during the third quarters of 2008 and 2009, respectively. On November 1, 2007, we announced plans to construct two additional 240C class jack up rigs, with delivery expected in 2010 and 2011. We currently anticipate funding construction of all 240C rigs through operating cash flows, but will consider attractive financing alternatives. Should our cash flows prove to be insufficient, we could be forced to delay or halt construction. Capital expenditures in 2007 included $3.8 million towards construction of our third 240C class jack up rig. Also on November 1, 2007, we signed contracts with Keppel AmFELS, Inc. to have four Super 116E class rigs constructed at their Brownsville, Texas shipyard, with delivery expected in 2010 and 2011. We estimate that each rig will cost approximately $175 million, with more than a third of that amount attributable to the cost value of the design, kit components and drilling equipment to be provided by our manufacturing businesses. The Super 116E class will employ the latest technology to enable drilling of high pressure, high temperature and extended reach wells in most prominent jack up markets throughout the world. Each rig will be equipped with the hook load and horsepower required to efficiently drill beyond 30,000 feet. We currently anticipate funding construction of all Super 116E rigs through operating cash flows, but will consider attractive financing alternatives. Should our cash flows be insufficient, we could be forced to accept unfavorable financing terms in order to complete construction. Capital expenditures in 2007 included $42.8 million towards construction of the Super 116E class rigs. Capital expenditures in 2007 also included $38.7 million for progress towards the construction of six new 2000 horsepower land rigs, following the eight that were delivered during 2006. Two of the six rigs are currently in process with delivery expected during the first and second quarters of 2008. These expenditures have been and should continue to be financed from cash flows. The remainder of 2007 capital expenditures was primarily for major enhancements to existing offshore rigs and manufacturing facilities. Our 2008 capital budget has initially been set at approximately $529 million, and includes $48 million for the J. P. Bussell, $77 million for the Rowan Mississippi, $144 million toward construction of the second and third 240C class rigs, $75 million toward construction of the four Super 116E class rigs, $60 million for manufacturing machines and equipment and $18 million for the two remaining new land rigs. We will periodically review and adjust the capital budget as necessary based upon our existing working capital and anticipated market conditions in our drilling and manufacturing businesses. Long Term Debt Rowans first two Tarzan Class jack up rigs and each of our four Super Gorilla class rigs were substantially financed through long term bank loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Transportations Maritime 39 Table of Contents Administration (MARAD). Under the MARAD Title XI program, we obtained reimbursements for qualifying expenditures up to a pre approved limit based upon actual construction progress. Outstanding borrowings initially bear a floating rate of interest and notes require semi annual payments of principal and accrued interest. The notes are secured by a preferred mortgage on the rig. The following table summarizes the status of each of our Title XI borrowings at December 31, 2007 (dollars in millions). Interest Repayment Repayment Final Rig Delivery Borrowings Repayments Balance Rate Dates Amounts Maturity Gorilla V Dec 1998 $ 153.1 $ 114.8 $38.3 6.94%, 6.15% Jan 1, July 1 $ 6.4 July 2010 Gorilla VI June 2000 171.0 106.9 64.1 5.88% Mar 15, Sep 15 7.1 Mar 2012 Gorilla VII Dec 2001 185.4 92.7 92.7 2.8% Apr 20, Oct 20 7.7 Oct 2013 Bob Palmer Aug 2003 187.3 41.6 145.7 6.05% floating Jan 15, July 15 5.2 July 2021 Scooter Yeargain April 2004 91.2 21.3 69.9 4.33% May 1, Nov 1 3.0 May 2019 Bob Keller Aug 2005 89.7 15.0 74.7 5.95% floating May 10, Nov 10 3.0 May 2020 Total $ 877.7 $ 392.3 $485.4 $ 32.4 Our outstanding Bob Palmer and Bob Keller borrowings bear interest at a short term commercial paper rate plus .25% and .15%, respectively. Rowan may fix these interest rates at any time and must fix them by July 15, 2011 and August 31, 2009, respectively. Our debt agreements contain provisions that require minimum levels of working capital and stockholders equity and limit the amount of long term debt and, in the event of noncompliance, restrict investment activities, asset purchases and sales, lease obligations, borrowings and mergers or acquisitions. Our debt agreements also specify the minimum insurance coverage for our financed rigs. The extent of hurricane damage sustained throughout the Gulf Coast area in recent years has dramatically increased the cost and reduced the availability of insurance coverage for windstorm losses. During our April 2006 policy renewal, we determined that windstorm coverage meeting the requirements of our existing debt agreements was cost prohibitive. We obtained from MARAD a waiver of the original insurance requirements in return for providing additional security, including restricted and unrestricted cash balances. Effective March 30, 2007, in connection with our 2007 policy renewal, the additional security provisions were modified and our minimum restricted cash balance was reduced from $156.1 million to $50 million. This amount is maintained in a separate account in which MARAD has a security interest and is shown separately as Restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheet. In addition, our unrestricted cash requirement was reduced from $100 million to $31 million. We remain subject to restrictions on the use of certain insurance proceeds should we experience further losses. Each of these additional security provisions will be released by MARAD if we are able to obtain windstorm coverage that satisfies the original terms of our debt agreements. We were in compliance with each of our debt covenants at December 31, 2007. Pension Obligations We have contributed more than $148 million to our defined benefit pension plans over the past five years, including almost $90 million during 2005. Minimum contribution amounts are determined based upon actuarial calculations of pension assets and liabilities that involve, among other things, assumptions about long term asset returns and interest rates. Similar calculations were used to estimate pension costs and obligations as reflected in our consolidated financial statements, which showed an unfunded pension liability of $123.5 million at December 31, 2007. We have amended the drilling divisions plan to freeze participation effective January 1, 2008, though we expect to make additional pension contributions over the next several years even if plan assets perform as expected. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 generally requires that plans be fully funded within seven years, and we currently estimate pension contributions of approximately $29 million for 2008. Retirement benefits to be paid from our pension plans are expected to average over $28 million annually over the next ten years. Cash Dividends On February 25, 2005, in conjunction with the sale of our aviation operations, we paid a special cash dividend of $.25 per share of our common stock to stockholders of record on February 9, 2005. On September 1, 2005, in conjunction with the sale of several non core assets, we paid a special cash dividend of $.25 per share of our 40 Table of Contents common stock to stockholders of record on August 17, 2005. On February 24, 2006, we paid a special cash dividend of $.25 per common share to stockholders of record on February 8, 2006. On May 9, 2006, we announced a regular quarterly dividend of $.10 per common share, which we have paid approximately every three months since. At December 31, 2007, we had approximately $253 million of retained earnings available for distribution to stockholders under the most restrictive provisions of our debt agreements. Proceeds from Asset Disposals Rowan received $120.7 million in 2005 in connection with the disposal of various assets. In February, we sold the purchase options on four leased anchor handling boats for approximately $21 million in cash. In September, we sold one of our oldest jack up rigs, the Rowan Texas, for approximately $45 million in cash, after selling expenses. Another $9.6 million was received earlier in 2005 as proceeds from the sale of marketable investment securities that had a nominal carrying cost. In October 2005, we sold our only semi submersible rig for approximately $60 million in cash. Payment for the rig occurred over a 15 month period ending in January 2007, at which point the title to the rig was transferred to the buyer. We retained ownership of much of the drilling equipment on the rig, which was sold in 2006, and continued to provide (through February 2007) a number of operating personnel under a separate services agreement. The transaction was accounted for as a sales type lease with the expected gain on the sale and imputed interest income of approximately $46 million deferred until the net book value of the rig had been recovered. During 2007, we received all remaining payments totaling $23.4 million and recognized such amount as additional gain on the sale. Another $14.1 million of gain was realized in 2007 on the June sale of our Alaska drilling camps. Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2007 (dollars in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations Total Within 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Long term debt and interest(1) $ 618.9 $ 89.3 $ 168.5 $ 123.7 $ 237.4 Purchase obligations 482.3 207.2 265.1 10.0 Operating leases 14.8 7.5 6.2 1.1 Total $ 1,116.0 $ 304.0 $ 439.8 $ 134.8 $ 237.4 (1) Amounts represent contractual principal and interest payments. Interest amounts reflect either stated fixed rates or assume current floating rates remain constant throughout the period. The preceding table includes a 2008 semi annual operating lease payment of $2.4 million for the 116C class jack up Cecil Provine, which we sold and leased back in 1985. We have exercised a second renewal option and extended the lease for one additional year through June 2009. The semi annual lease payment during that additional year will reflect a fair market value charter rate determined through a joint appraisal process. We believe that the new lease payment may increase from its current level, although the amount is not presently determinable. Under the extended lease agreement, we retain additional lease and purchase options for the Cecil Provine. We periodically employ letters of credit or other bank issued guarantees in the normal course of our businesses, and were contingently liable for performance under such agreements to the extent of approximately $38 million at December 31, 2007. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments. Based on current and anticipated near term operating levels, we believe that operating cash flows together with existing working capital will be adequate to sustain planned capital expenditures and debt service and other requirements at least through the remainder of 2008. We currently have no other available credit facilities, but believe financing could be obtained if deemed necessary. 41 Table of Contents Contingent Liabilities During 2005, we lost four offshore rigs, including the Rowan Halifax, and incurred significant damage on a fifth as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Since that time, we have been working to locate the lost or damaged rigs, salvage related equipment, remove debris, wreckage and pollutants from the water, mark or clear navigational hazards and clear rights of way. At December 31, 2007, we had incurred $156.1 million of costs related to such efforts, of which $96.6 million had been reimbursed through insurance, leaving $59.4 million included in Receivables. We have since received another $35.5 million of insurance reimbursements. We expect to incur additional costs in the near term to fulfill our obligations to remove wreckage and debris in amounts that will depend on the extent and nature of work ultimately required and the duration thereof. Previously, we reported the filing of a lawsuit styled Rowan Companies, Inc. vs. Certain Underwriters at Lloyds and Insurance Companies Subscribing to Cover Note ARS 4183 in the 215th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas. The lawsuit was withdrawn following the agreement by such underwriters to reimburse us for the reasonable cost of removing wreckage and debris remaining on the drilling locations. We also previously reported that certain of our insurance underwriters at higher limits of liability had notified us that they were reserving their right to deny coverage for any costs incurred in wreckage and debris removal activities that they believed were outside the scope of their policy. This reservation of rights letter has now been withdrawn and our coverage for costs at these higher limits of liability has been reaffirmed. At this time, we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage and will be reimbursed for costs incurred and to be incurred. We leased the jack up Rowan Halifax under a charter agreement that commenced in 1984 and was scheduled to expire in March 2008. The rig was insured for $43.4 million prior to being lost during Hurricane Rita in 2005. We believe the insured value satisfied the requirements of the charter agreement, and by a margin sufficient to cover the $6.3 million carrying value of our equipment installed on the rig. However, the owner of the rig claimed that the rig should have been insured for its fair market value and sought recovery from us for compensation above the insured value. Thus, we assumed no insurance proceeds related to the Rowan Halifax and recorded a charge during 2005 for the full carrying value of our equipment. On November 3, 2005, we filed a declaratory judgment action styled Rowan Companies, Inc. vs. Textron Financial Corporation and Wilmington Trust Company as Owner Trustee of the Rowan Halifax 116 C Jack Up Rig in the 215th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas. The owner filed a similar declaratory judgment action, claiming a value of approximately $83 million for the rig. The owners motion for summary judgment was granted on January 25, 2007 which, unless overturned on appeal, would make us liable to the owner for the approximately $40 million difference between the owners claim and the insurance coverage, plus interest and costs. We continue to believe that our interpretation of the charter agreement is correct, and we are vigorously pursuing an appeal to overturn the summary judgment ruling. We do not believe, therefore, that it is probable that we have incurred a loss, nor one that is estimable, and have made no accrual for such at December 31, 2007. During 2004, we learned that the Environmental and Natural Resources Division, Environmental Crimes Section of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had begun conducting a criminal investigation of environmental matters involving several of our offshore drilling rigs, including a rig known as the Rowan Midland, which at various times operated at locations in the Gulf of Mexico. On October 9, 2007, we entered into a Plea agreement (Plea) with the DOJ, under which we pled guilty to three felony charges relating to operations on the Rowan Midland between 2002 and 2004: (i) causing the discharge of a pollutant, abrasive sandblast media, into U.S. navigable waters, thereby violating the Clean Water Act, (ii) failing to immediately report the discharge of waste hydraulic oil from the Rowan Midland into U.S. navigable waters, thereby violating the Clean Water Act, and (iii) discharging garbage from the Rowan Midland in violation of the Act to Prevent Pollution from Ships. As part of the Plea, we paid a fine of $7 million and made community service payments totaling $2 million to various organizations. In anticipation of such payments, we recognized a $9 million charge to our fourth quarter 2006 operations. Under the Plea, we would have been subject to unsupervised probation for a period of two years. The Plea was submitted for approval to the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. On November 8, 2007, we entered into an amended plea agreement with the DOJ extending the unsupervised probationary period from two to three years, which was then approved by the court on November 9, 2007. During the period of unsupervised probation, we must ensure that we commit no further criminal violations of federal, state, or local laws 42 Table of Contents or regulations and must also continue to implement our comprehensive Environmental Management System Plan. Subsequent to the conduct at issue, we sold the Rowan Midland to a third party. The Environmental Protection Agency has approved a compliance agreement with us which, among other things, contains a certification that the conditions giving rise to the violations to which we entered guilty pleas have been corrected. If we fully comply with the terms of the compliance agreement, we believe that we will not be suspended or debarred from entering into or participating in contracts with the U.S. Government or any of its agencies. On January 3, 2008, a civil lawsuit styled State of Louisiana, ex. rel. Charles C. Foti, Jr. , Attorney General vs. Rowan Companies, Inc. was filed in the Eastern District Court of Texas, Marshall Division, seeking damages, civil penalties and costs and expenses for alleged commission of maritime torts and violations of environmental and other laws and regulations involving the Rowan Midland and other facilities in areas in or near Louisiana. We intend to vigorously defend our position in this case but cannot estimate any potential liability at this time. During 2005, we learned that the DOJ was conducting an investigation of potential antitrust violations among helicopter transportation providers in the Gulf of Mexico. Our former aviation subsidiary, which was sold effective December 31, 2004, received a subpoena in connection with the investigation. We have not been contacted by the DOJ, but the purchaser claimed that we are responsible for any exposure it may have. We have disputed that claim. In June 2007, we received a subpoena for documents from the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Louisiana relating to a grand jury hearing. The agency requesting the information is the U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of Inspector General Investigations. The documents requested include all records relating to use of our entertainment facilities and entertainment expenses for a former employee of the Minerals Management Service, U.S. Department of Interior and other records relating to items of value provided to any official or employee of the U.S. Government. We have fully cooperated with the subpoena and have received no further requests. The construction of our fourth Tarzan Class jack up rig, the J. P. Bussell, was originally subcontracted to an outside Gulf of Mexico shipyard, Signal International LLC (Signal), and scheduled for delivery in the third quarter of 2007 at a total cost of approximately $145 million. As a result of various problems encountered on the project, the expected completion of the rig is now at least one year behind schedule and its expected final cost is at least 20% over the original estimate. Accordingly, we have recently declared Signal in breach of contract and initiated court proceedings styled Rowan Companies, Inc. and LeTourneau Technologies, Inc. vs. Signal International LLC in the 269th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas to relocate the rig to our Sabine Pass, Texas facility for completion by our Drilling Products and Systems segment and to recover the cost to complete the rig over and above the agreed contract price, plus interest. We anticipate that Signal will file a counterclaim against us, alleging breach of contract and claiming damages for amounts owed and additional costs incurred totaling in excess of $20 million. We intend to vigorously defend our rights under the contract. We do not believe that it is probable that we have incurred a loss, nor one that is estimable, and have made no accrual for such at December 31, 2007. We are involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to our businesses and are vigorously defending our position in all such matters. We believe that there are no other known contingencies, claims or lawsuits that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies and Management Estimates Rowans significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 52 of this Form 10 K. These policies, and management judgments, assumptions and estimates made in their application, underlie reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that our most critical accounting policies and management estimates involve revenue recognition (primarily upfront service fees for equipment moves and modifications and longer term manufacturing projects), property and depreciation (particularly capitalizable costs, useful lives and salvage values) and pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs (specifically assumptions used in actuarial calculations), as changes in such policies and or estimates would produce significantly different amounts from those reported herein. 43 Table of Contents Revenue recognition. Our drilling contracts generally provide for payment on a day rate basis, and revenues are recognized as the work progresses with the passage of time. We frequently receive lump sum payments at the outset of a drilling assignment as upfront service fees for equipment moves or modifications, and such payments (and related costs) are recognized as drilling revenues (and expenses) over the contract period. At December 31, 2007, we had deferred $80.1 million of revenues and $53.7 million of costs related to such upfront service fees, with such amounts primarily related to mobilization and modification activities in connection with Middle East drilling contracts. We generally recognize manufacturing sales and related costs when title passes as products are shipped. Revenues from longer term manufacturing projects such as rigs and rig kits are recognized on the percentage of completion basis using costs incurred relative to total estimated costs. We do not recognize any estimated profit until such projects are at least 10% complete, though a full provision is made immediately for any anticipated losses. Total estimated costs, which include project materials, direct labor and production overhead expenses, are critical to this process and are therefore reviewed on a regular basis. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized $158.5 million of manufacturing revenues and $133.7 million of costs related to such projects on the percentage of completion basis. Such costs include an additional $15.8 million loss recognized on our external rig construction project which was completed in June 2007, resulting in a total loss on the project of approximately $17.9 million. This additional loss resulted from an increase in the total cost of the project, most of which was due to the project requiring many more labor hours than were originally anticipated. The efforts by our Drilling Products and Systems segment to deliver the Hank Boswell three months ahead of schedule, rebuild the Rowan Louisiana and assist with modifications to our Middle East rigs had the effect of increasing the cost of this project. Property and depreciation. We provide depreciation under the straight line method from the date an asset is placed into service based upon estimated service lives ranging up to 40 years and salvage values ranging up to 20%. We continue to operate 14 offshore jack up rigs that were placed into service at various dates during the 1971 1986 period. Many of those rigs had met or far exceeded their assigned useful lives of 12 15 years when our next rig, the Super Gorilla class Gorilla V, was delivered in 1998. The Super Gorilla class and the subsequent Tarzan Class have been assigned 25 year useful lives and are specifically designed to achieve greater drilling performance while encountering tougher well conditions. Each class of rig employs technological advances in load bearing capability, power distribution and solids control designed to provide more efficient drilling to greater depths, which should help to ensure its continuing economic life to the Company. Expenditures for new property or enhancements to existing property are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Capitalized cost includes labor expended during installation and, on newly constructed assets, a portion of interest cost incurred during the construction period. Long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever circumstances indicate their carrying amounts may not be recoverable, such as following a sustained deficit in operating cash flows caused by a prominent decline in overall rig activity and average day rates. Pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs. As previously mentioned, our pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs are based upon actuarial computations that reflect our assumptions about future events, including long term asset returns, interest rates, annual compensation increases, mortality rates and other factors. Key assumptions for December 31, 2007 included discount rates ranging from 6.37% to 6.55%, an expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets of 8% and annual healthcare cost increases ranging from 10% in 2008 to 5% in 2012 and beyond. The assumed discount rate is based upon the average yield for Moodys Aa rated corporate bonds and the rate of return assumption reflects a probability distribution of expected long term returns that is weighted based upon plan asset allocations. A 1 percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase our recorded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities by approximately $81 million, while a 1 percentage point change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would change annual net benefits cost by approximately $3 million. A 1 percentage point increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would increase 2008 other benefits costs by $0.6 million. 44 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements Our adoption, effective January 1, 2006, of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, which requires the measurement and recognition of stock based compensation expense based upon grant date fair value, reduced our net income by approximately $3.2 million or $.03 per share in 2006. Prior to 2006, we used the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation pursuant to Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25. We estimate that the provisions of Statement 123R would have reduced net income by $3.0 million or $.02 per diluted share in 2005. Our adoption, effective January 1, 2006, of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 151, Inventory Costs, which clarifies the distinction between costs that are allocable to inventory and those that are expensed as incurred, did not materially impact our financial position or results of operations. As a result of the implementation of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, effective January 1, 2007, the Company recognized a $1.6 million decrease in Retained earnings and a $5.5 increase in Other liabilities as of that date. On December 31, 2007, Rowan had $3.4 million of unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would reduce the Companys income tax provision if recognized. Rowan does not expect to recognize significant increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 became effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008, and did not have a material impact on our financial statements. SFAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, which required that the funded status of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans be fully recognized in our December 31, 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet, had the effect of increasing our balances for Other liabilities, Deferred income taxes and Accumulated other comprehensive loss at that date by $67.1 million, $23.5 million and $43.6 million, respectively. Though balance sheet recognition is now required for the unamortized portion of gains and losses, prior service cost and transition assets, such amounts will continue to be excluded from net periodic benefits cost and included within other comprehensive income (loss). In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value. SFAS No. 159 became effective for our fiscal year beginning January 1, 2008, and did not have a material impact on our financial statements. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, which sets forth the Staffs views regarding the process of quantifying financial statement misstatements, did not materially affect our financial position or results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS Rowans outstanding debt at December 31, 2007 was comprised as follows: $265.0 million of fixed rate notes bearing a weighted average annual interest rate of 4.48% and $220.4 million of floating rate notes bearing a weighted average annual interest rate of 6.01%. Rowan believes that its exposure to risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates is limited in that the Company may fix the interest rate on its outstanding floating rate debt at any time. In addition, the majority of Rowans transactions are carried out in United States dollars; thus, the Companys foreign currency exposure is not material. Fluctuating commodity prices affect Rowans future earnings materially to the extent that they influence demand for the Companys products and services. Rowan does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments. 45
