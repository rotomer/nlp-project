ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table highlights Rowans operating results for the years indicated (in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Revenues: Drilling $ 1,451.6 $ 1,382.6 $ 1,067.4 Manufacturing: Drilling products and systems 493.5 498.6 241.0 Mining, forestry and steel products 267.6 213.8 202.3 Total manufacturing 761.1 712.4 443.3 Total revenues $ 2,212.7 $ 2,095.0 $ 1,510.7 Costs and expenses: Drilling $ 781.5 $ 720.8 $ 619.7 Manufacturing: Drilling products and systems 538.1 455.6 217.5 Mining, forestry and steel products 235.0 184.7 187.8 Total manufacturing 773.1 640.3 405.3 Total costs and expenses $ 1,554.6 $ 1,361.1 $ 1,025.0 Operating income: Drilling $ 670.1 $ 661.8 $ 447.7 Manufacturing: Drilling products and systems (44.6 ) 43.0 23.5 Mining, forestry and steel products 32.6 29.1 14.5 Total manufacturing (12.0 ) 72.1 38.0 Total operating income $ 658.1 $ 733.9 $ 485.7 Income from continuing operations $ 427.6 $ 483.8 $ 317.0 Income from discontinued operations $ 0.0 $ 0.0 $ 1.2 Net income $ 427.6 $ 483.8 $ 318.2 As indicated in the preceding table, Rowans results of operations are primarily driven by the performance of our Drilling division, which comprises about 95% of our fixed assets and, over the past three years, has generated 67% of our aggregate revenues and 95% of our aggregate operating income. Our Manufacturing division, featuring our Drilling Products and Systems segment, has led the strategic expansion and upgrade of our drilling fleet over the past decade and, in recent years, has expanded product lines and improved contributions to our operating results. Costs and expenses in 2008 included $111.2 million of charges and other expenses, including impairment charges relating to the cancelled rig construction project, realizable value of manufacturing inventories and goodwill, professional service fees and other expenses incurred in connection with the suspended LTI monetization process and severance costs resulting from the retirement of the Companys Chief Executive Officer effective December 31, 2008 and headcount reductions. The monetization costs were allocated between manufacturing segments based upon relative revenues; all other items were directly attributable to a specific operating segment. These items are described more fully in the operating segment discussions below. 29 Table of Contents Income from continuing operations is after interest income and expense, other income and expense items and provision for income taxes, as follows (in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Interest income $ 6.3 $ 20.9 $ 28.0 Interest expense (18.6 ) (25.9 ) (28.3 ) Capitalized interest 17.4 10.0 7.8 Other income (expense) net (9.1 ) 0.2 0.2 Provision for income taxes (226.5 ) (255.3 ) (176.4 ) The amount shown in the preceding table as Income from discontinued operations in 2006 reflects the after tax effect of an excise tax refund related to our aviation operations that were sold in 2004. The performance of each of our operating segments over the 2006 2008 period is discussed more fully below. Drilling Operations Rowans Drilling operating results are primarily a function of the activity (or utilization) and day rates achieved by our land and offshore rig fleets. Rig activity and day rates are primarily determined by oil and gas company exploration and development expenditures, which are heavily influenced by trends in oil and natural gas prices, and the availability of competitive equipment. When drilling markets are strengthening, as they have in recent years, day rates generally lag the upward trend in rig activity and day rate increases can be more significant as utilization approaches 100%. When drilling markets are weakening, as they are currently, day rates are often significantly reduced in an effort to maintain utilization. Due to intense competition in the contract drilling industry, both utilization and day rates have historically declined much faster than they have risen. Current Market Conditions For most of the past several years, global demand for oil and natural gas has been increasing, especially in developing nations like China and India. At the same time, many key producers increasingly struggled with depleting reserves, requiring more drilling simply to maintain production levels. These market forces caused a dramatic increase in energy prices. Oil prices, for example, which averaged around $30 per barrel throughout the 2000 2004 period, stayed consistently above $50 during the 2005 2006 period, ended 2007 near $100 and hit an all time high of more than $145 in July 2008. Natural gas prices have followed a similar pattern in recent years, though with much more volatility, generally staying above $6 per mcf since late 2004 and peaking in mid 2008 at around $14. As a result, marginal drilling projects that went undrilled with oil at $30 per barrel or gas at $3 per mcf, became very economical at prices well above $50 and $5, respectively. Many of these projects were in increasingly difficult drilling environments and demanded the most capable drilling equipment. Meanwhile, the global jack up fleet, with relatively few net rig additions between 1986 and 2005, continued to age. These factors caused a surge in worldwide drilling activity beginning in 2005, with all available rigs benefitting. The more capable rigs were marketable throughout the world, and were generally able to obtain longer term contracts and higher day rates than older and less capable commodity rigs. Rowans average day rates improved from less than $50,000 during 2004 to over $163,000 in 2008. Since the middle of 2008, when the global economy began slipping into recession and access to capital diminished significantly due to weakening financial markets, both oil and natural gas prices have declined by approximately 70%. Most companies have been forced to reduce spending in order to preserve liquidity, and energy companies in particular, with the prospect of significantly reduced cash flows and constrained capital resources, are cutting future exploration and development expenditures. We discuss the likely impact on our future operations under Outlook beginning on page 36. Our Rig Fleets Our offshore fleet consists currently of 22 jack up rigs, featuring: Two 84 class jack ups and one 116 class jack up built during the mid to late 1970s, Seven 116C class jack ups built during the early 1980s, 30 Table of Contents Three Gorilla class jack ups built during the early 1980s, Four Super Gorilla class jack ups constructed during the 1998 2003 period, Four Tarzan Class jack ups delivered during the 2004 2008 period, and One 240C class jack up delivered in 2008. Six additional jack ups are under construction or on order with deliveries currently expected over the 2009 2011 period, including two 240C class rigs and four EXL (formerly Super 116E) class rigs see further discussion of our offshore newbuild program under Capital Expenditures beginning on page 43. Our current land fleet totals 31 rigs, including 15 rigs constructed over the past three years, four rigs built during 2001 2002 and 12 older rigs that have been refurbished over the years. One additional land rig is expected to be delivered in the first quarter of 2009. Our International Expansion For most of our history offshore, our drilling operations have been focused in the Gulf of Mexico, where ten of our offshore rigs are currently operating. This market is highly fragmented among several oil and gas companies, many of whom are independent operators whose drilling activities are highly dependent upon near term operating cash flows. A typical drilling assignment may call for 60 days of exploration or development work, performed under a single well contract with negotiable renewal options. Long term contracts have been relatively rare, and generally are available only from the major integrated oil companies and a few of the larger independent operators. Thus, drilling activity and day rates in this market have tended to fluctuate rather quickly, and generally follow trends in natural gas prices. In 2005, we began to increasingly focus our marketing efforts in foreign areas where demand was strengthening and longer term drilling opportunities for high specification rigs were becoming more prevalent. Since that time, we have substantially diversified our drilling operations from the Gulf of Mexico. The relocation of rigs from one geographic area to another is a significant undertaking, which, together with any associated equipment upgrades, often interrupts revenues and cash flows for three to four months. Thus, such actions are typically carried out only when the likelihood of higher long term returns heavily outweighs the short term costs. This migration of rigs to foreign markets, together with the significant loss of equipment during the 2005 hurricanes and higher commodity prices, led to increased drilling activity and created a jack up supply deficit in the Gulf of Mexico in 2006. As a result, rig day rates, which increased dramatically in late 2005, continued to set new records during 2006 and early 2007, and the occasional term drilling contract, ranging from six months to two years, became available for certain high specification rigs that remained. Generally, Gulf of Mexico market conditions peaked in 2007 and began weakening in late 2008. The Middle East market has been a primary focus for our drilling operations since late 2005, when we obtained three year contracts from Saudi Aramco for four of our jack up rigs, which commenced operations offshore Saudi Arabia in April 2006. In 2007, we added four rigs to this market: two year contracts for Maersk offshore Qatar, which began in late January, and four year contracts covering two Tarzan Class rigs for Saudi Aramco, which began in late March. A third Tarzan Class rig became our ninth rig in the Middle East market when it began a three year assignment for Saudi Aramco in the second quarter of 2008. Both Qatar rigs have been extended for an additional year. The North Sea is a mature, harsh environment offshore drilling market that has long been dominated by major oil and gas companies operating within a relatively tight regulatory environment. Project lead times are often lengthy and drilling assignments, which typically require ultra premium equipment capable of handling extreme weather conditions and high down hole pressures and temperatures, can range from several months to several years. Thus, drilling activity and day rates in the North Sea move slowly in response to market conditions, and generally follow trends in oil prices. We currently have two Super Gorilla class rigs operating in the North Sea market, one under contract into the first quarter of 2010 and the other into the second quarter of 2010. 31 Table of Contents We have operated offshore eastern Canada at varying levels since the early 1980s, though not since late 2006. One of our Gorilla class rigs will return to eastern Canada in mid 2009 for two assignments totaling approximately eleven months. In the past, Rowan has not cold stacked its offshore drilling rigs during extended idle periods as the long term costs of rehiring and retraining personnel and restarting equipment typically negate any short term savings. Thus, our drilling expenses have not typically fluctuated with rig activity, though they have increased as our rig fleets have been expanded and relocated. 2008 Compared to 2007 The following table highlights the performance of our Drilling division during 2008 compared to 2007 (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 1,451.6 100 $ 1,382.6 100 Operating costs (629.8 ) (43 ) (591.4 ) (43 ) Depreciation expense (125.9 ) (9 ) (101.8 ) (7 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (69.2 ) (5 ) (68.3 ) (5 ) Gains on property disposals 68.0 5 40.7 3 Material charges and other operating expenses (24.6 ) (2 ) Operating income $ 670.1 46 $ 661.8 48 Drilling revenues increased by $69.0 million or 5% in 2008, due primarily to the effects of increased drilling activity and average day rates, as follows (in millions): New rigs $ 33.2 Increases in average day rates 23.7 Net increase in activity for existing rigs 16.6 Net increase in activity for relocated rigs 12.5 Lost or sold rigs (9.4 ) Other, primarily reduced rebilled expenses (7.6 ) Total increase $ 69.0 Our overall offshore fleet utilization was 95% in 2008, up from 94% in 2007, with most of the downtime in each period associated with rigs being prepared for long term assignments overseas. We compute rig utilization as revenue producing days divided by total available rig days. Our average offshore day rate was $163,200 in 2008, an increase of approximately 4% over 2007. Average day rates are determined as recorded revenues, excluding rebilled expenses, divided by revenue producing days. Total revenue producing days offshore increased by 103 or 1% between years, with most of that increase associated with our new rigs. Middle East. Our nine jack ups working offshore Saudi Arabia and Qatar collectively generated approximately $480 million of drilling revenues in 2008, averaging more than $155,000 per day, compared to almost $400 million from eight rigs averaging $149,000 per day in 2007. Our utilization averaged 94% in 2008, up from 92% in 2007. North Sea. Our two rigs working in the North Sea generated approximately $164 million of drilling revenues in 2008, averaging about $245,000 per day, compared to $246 million from three rigs averaging $241,000 per day in 2007. Our utilization averaged 91% in 2008, down from 96% in 2007, with most of the downtime in the current year due to rigs undergoing shipyard upgrades. 32 Table of Contents Other International. After relocating from the North Sea in early January 2008, Gorilla VII was 96% utilized offshore West Africa and provided almost $325,000 per day in drilling revenues during the remainder of the year. Gorilla III was 100% utilized offshore Trinidad during the first five months of 2008, generating approximately $40 million of drilling revenues during the period, or more than $249,000 per day. Gorilla III relocated to the Gulf of Mexico during the second quarter of 2008 where the rig was 98% utilized during the remainder of the year. Gulf of Mexico. The following table summarizes average natural gas prices and our Gulf of Mexico fleet utilization and average day rates during the year: Natural Average Average Gas (MCF)* Utilization Day Rate First quarter 2008 $ 8.74 91 % $ 114,100 Second quarter 2008 11.47 98 % 126,600 Third quarter 2008 8.98 100 % 131,400 Fourth quarter 2008 6.40 100 % 144,600 Full year 2008 8.90 97 % 129,900 Full year 2007 7.12 96 % 129,300 * Source: New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) Natural gas prices remained at historically high levels over the first half of 2008, and our fleet achieved stable utilization and increasing average day rates during that period, though shipyard time for upgrades to the Bob Palmer reduced average utilization during the first quarter. As prices weakened dramatically over the last half of the year, our contracted backlog helped to insulate Rowan from the effects of reduced drilling demand that ensued in the Gulf of Mexico and throughout the United States. The addition of the Rowan Mississippi and J. P. Bussell in November 2008, coupled with the loss of our oldest jack up, the Rowan Anchorage, during Hurricane Ike in September, increased our average rate during the fourth quarter. As shown in the preceding table, our average Gulf of Mexico day rate increased by $1,100 or 1% during 2008, though, by year end, we had begun to feel the impact of weakening demand for our three skid off rigs. Our total revenue producing days in the Gulf of Mexico decreased by 97 or 3% in 2008, due primarily to the effects of rig relocations. Land. Contracted backlog also enabled our 30 deep well land rigs in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Alaska to withstand the volatile domestic market conditions during 2008, and attain 93% utilization and an average day rate of $22,600 during the year, compared to 95% and $22,800 in 2007. The fleet included four new 2000 horsepower rigs that were delivered during 2008, which contributed to a 701 or 7% increase in revenue producing days during the year. Operating Costs. Drilling operating costs increased by $38.4 million or 6% in 2008 compared to 2007, due primarily to effects of the following (in millions): Compensation costs and related benefits for existing rigs increased by 7% $ 19.8 Repairs and maintenance for existing rigs increased by 18% 19.3 Rig insurance costs for existing rigs decreased by 21% (11.7 ) New rigs Rowan Mississippi and J. P. Bussell (November 2008) and four land rigs 11.2 All other (0.2 ) Total increase $ 38.4 Depreciation expense incurred by our drilling operations increased by $24.1 million or 24% in 2008, due primarily to the addition of the rigs noted above. Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $0.9 million or 1% in 2008, due primarily to higher professional service fees resulting from our international expansion and incremental incentive compensation costs associated with our improved financial results. Our drilling operations realized $68.0 million of gains on asset disposals during 2008, including $37.1 million from insurance proceeds received in connection with the loss of the Rowan Anchorage during Hurricane Ike, $14.5 million from the sale of our London office, $5.4 million from the sale of our Fourchon, Louisiana yard and 33 Table of Contents $4.7 million from the sale of a land rig. Our 2007 net gain was $40.7 million, and included $14.1 million from the sale of our Alaska based drilling camps and $23.4 million related to the installment sale of the Rowan Midland and related equipment. Our fourth quarter 2008 Drilling operations included $24.6 million of charges and other operating expenses, including $11.8 million for the estimated unrecoverable cost of amounts expended on the fourth 240C rig which has been cancelled, $8.5 million related to severance costs, including the impact of accelerated equity awards, primarily resulting from our CEOs retirement effective December 31, 2008, $2.8 million of primarily professional service fees incurred in connection with the suspended LTI monetization process, and $1.5 million related to the impairment of goodwill. 2007 Compared to 2006 The following table highlights the performance of our Drilling division during 2007 compared to 2006 (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 1,382.6 100 $ 1,067.4 100 Operating costs (591.4 ) (43 ) (504.9 ) (47 ) Depreciation expense (101.8 ) (7 ) (77.5 ) (7 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (68.3 ) (5 ) (56.5 ) (5 ) Gains on property disposals 40.7 3 19.2 2 Operating income $ 661.8 48 $ 447.7 43 Drilling revenues increased by $315.2 million or 30% in 2007, due primarily to the effects of increased average day rates between periods, which more than offset the net impact of changes in our rigs fleets and reduced drilling activity for relocating rigs, as follows (in millions): Increases in average day rates $ 140.8 New or reactivated rigs 124.3 Net increase in activity for relocated rigs 77.8 Decrease in rebilled expenses (18.8 ) Other, primarily net reduced activity for existing rigs (8.9 ) Total increase $ 315.2 Our overall offshore fleet utilization was 94% in 2007, up from 86% in 2006, as several rigs were being prepared for long term assignments overseas. Our average offshore day rate was $156,200 in 2007, an increase of approximately 11% over 2006. Total revenue producing days declined by just over 1,154 or 19% between years, with much of that decrease associated with the rigs that were being prepared for long term assignments overseas. Middle East. During early 2007, four of our rigs commenced operations in the Middle East under multi year contracts following their relocation from the Gulf of Mexico. Our eight jack ups working offshore Saudi Arabia and Qatar collectively generated approximately $400 million of drilling revenues in 2007, averaging almost $149,000 per day, compared to almost $115 million from four rigs averaging $113,000 per day in 2006. Our utilization averaged 92% in 2007, up from 66% in 2006, with most of the downtime in each period associated with relocating rigs. North Sea. After relocating from Canada in early 2007, Gorilla VI was 100% utilized in the North Sea and provided more than $302,000 per day there in drilling revenues during the remainder of the year. Our three rigs working in the North Sea generated approximately $246 million of drilling revenues in 2007, averaging more than $241,000 per day, compared to $119 million from two rigs averaging $169,000 per day in 2006. Our utilization averaged 96% in 2007, unchanged from 2006. 34 Table of Contents Other International. Gorilla III was 100% utilized offshore Trinidad in 2007 and generated more than $76 million of drilling revenues, or almost $209,000 per day during the year. Gulf of Mexico. The following table summarizes average natural gas prices and our Gulf of Mexico fleet utilization and average day rates during the year: Natural Average Average Gas (MCF)* Utilization Day Rate First quarter 2007 $ 7.17 98 % $ 127,700 Second quarter 2007 7.66 92 % 123,800 Third quarter 2007 6.24 98 % 132,100 Fourth quarter 2007 7.39 94 % 133,300 Full year 2007 7.12 96 % 129,300 Full year 2006 6.98 91 % 138,800 * Source: New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) As discussed above, natural gas prices remained at historically high levels throughout 2007, though fluctuating weather conditions and high storage levels contributed to price weakness during the third quarter and reduced drilling demand in the Gulf of Mexico and throughout the United States. Thus, the migration of many competitive jack ups from the Gulf of Mexico continued throughout the year. Most of the available rigs that remained in the area encountered tougher competition for fewer drilling assignments and, as a result, declining day rates. Our six month to two year term commitments for four of our nine Gulf of Mexico rigs helped to insulate Rowan from the impact of weakening demand, as such rigs above were collectively 95% utilized in 2007 and averaged more than $180,000 per day in drilling revenues during the year. As shown in the preceding table, our average Gulf of Mexico day rate decreased by $9,500 or 7% during 2007. The Rowan Louisiana, which was severely damaged in 2005 during Hurricane Katrina, returned to service in the Gulf of Mexico in December 2006, and was 100% utilized in 2007. Our total revenue producing days in the Gulf of Mexico decreased by 777 or 20% in 2007 due to the rig relocations that occurred over the past two years. Land. Our 29 deep well land rigs in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Alaska generally withstood the weakening domestic market conditions during 2007, and attained 95% utilization and an average day rate of $22,800 during the year, compared to 97% and $22,600 in 2006. The fleet included twelve new 2000 horsepower rigs that were constructed during the past two years which contributed to a 2,497 or 36% increase in revenue producing days in 2007. Operating Costs. Drilling operating costs increased by $86.5 million or 17% in 2007 compared to 2006, due primarily to effects of the following (in millions): New or reactivated rigs Hank Boswell (September 2006), Rowan Louisiana (December 2006) and twelve land rigs $ 57.9 Rebillable expenses for existing rigs primarily rig relocation costs decreased by 54% (25.9 ) Compensation costs and related benefits for existing rigs 18.6 Towing costs primarily international rig moves increased by 255% 13.4 Repairs and maintenance for existing rigs increased by 14% 11.1 All other 11.4 Total increase $ 86.5 Depreciation expense incurred by our drilling operations increased by $24.3 million or 31% in 2007, due primarily to the addition of the rigs noted above. Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $11.8 million or 21% in 2007, due primarily to incremental incentive compensation costs associated with our improved financial results. 35 Table of Contents Our drilling operations realized $40.7 million of gains on asset disposals during 2007, including a $14.1 million gain in connection with the sale of our Alaska based drilling camps and a $23.4 million gain related to the installment sale of the Rowan Midland and related equipment. The net gain for 2006 was $28.2 million, most of which related to the installment sale of the Rowan Midland and related equipment. Our 2006 operating results also included a $9.0 million charge in the fourth quarter for fines and community service payments made in 2007 in settlement of criminal charges stemming from a Department of Justice criminal investigation of environmental matters involving several of our offshore drilling rigs. This matter is discussed more fully under LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES: Contingent Liabilities beginning on page 46. Outlook Worldwide rig demand is inherently volatile and has historically varied from one market to the next, as has the supply of competitive equipment. Exploration and development expenditures can be impacted by many local factors, such as political and regulatory policies, seasonal weather patterns, lease expirations, new oil and gas discoveries and reservoir depletion. Over time, the level and expected direction of oil and natural gas prices appear to have been the principal determinants of drilling activity, and oil and gas prices are ultimately a function of the supply of and demand for those commodities. The dramatic declines in oil and natural gas prices over the last several months coupled with the weakness in the global capital markets have increased our customers efforts to preserve liquidity and have adversely affected the economics of certain drilling projects. Most oil and gas producers, in fact, have announced significant reductions in their 2009 drilling budgets, which has rapidly impacted the global jack up market, reducing rig utilization, increasing competition among available rigs for fewer drilling assignments and pressuring day rates downward. Limitations on the availability of capital, or higher costs of capital, may cause energy companies to make additional budget reductions in the future even if oil and natural gas prices return to and remain at historically high levels. Any such reductions would probably accelerate the decline in rig utilization and day rates. There are nearly 70 jack ups currently under construction or on order for completion by 2011, most of which do not have drilling contracts in place, and delivery of those rigs is expected to increase competitive pressures in the drilling industry. Our backlog of drilling contracts currently exceeds $1.7 billion and extends into 2011. More than one half of our available rig days in 2009 are under contract, and all of our drilling contracts have severe termination penalties. Facing reduced liquidity, certain of our customers have sought to modify existing contracts. Should market conditions worsen, they may seek to delay payments due to us or cancel drilling commitments. Though we intend to enforce our drilling contracts and will vigorously defend our rights thereunder, any such disputes would adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows to the extent that collections are delayed and administrative costs are increased. Hurricanes have caused tremendous damage to drilling and production equipment and facilities throughout the Gulf Coast in recent years, and we suffered a significant loss of prospective revenues from the total destruction of one rig in 2002, four rigs in 2005, and another rig in September 2008. This has severely impacted the availability and affordability of windstorm insurance in the Gulf of Mexico, which remains significantly more expensive than it was before the 2005 hurricanes despite rate reductions obtained in the past two years and our retention of significantly more risk for such losses. Our relocation of rigs from the Gulf of Mexico has helped to offset the increase in insurance rates since 2005. The damage experienced during the 2008 hurricane season is expected to significantly reduce the availability and increase the cost of windstorm insurance again in 2009, and we expect to assume more of the risk of such losses in 2009. Over the past few years, there have been notable declines in demand for available drilling equipment that coincided with the onset of hurricane season each June. This has periodically forced many jack up contractors, including Rowan, to accept reduced rates in certain cases in order to keep such rigs fully utilized. We expect that this pattern of reduced Gulf of Mexico drilling opportunities during hurricane season will continue. The surge in drilling activity in recent years has increased demand for, and cost of, parts, supplies and personnel. In addition, drilling equipment running near capacity for extended periods ultimately requires more 36 Table of Contents extensive maintenance and repairs. Despite reduced demand for drilling services, these inflationary pressures could continue in 2009, which would reduce operating results. Our Drilling operations are currently benefitting from contracted backlog obtained during the predominantly favorable market conditions of the past few years and are profitable. As noted above, such conditions have dramatically worsened over the past several months, and could worsen further in the near future. As our rigs roll off existing contracts, we will, in certain cases, be forced to accept reduced rates in order to preserve utilization, and may experience extended idle periods between contracts. We may need to move our rigs between geographic areas in order to obtain work, and may be unable to recover the cost of doing so. There is no assurance, in fact, that utilization of our available rigs can be preserved, that spot day rates will remain above breakeven levels or that our Drilling operations will remain profitable. Should we cold stack idle rigs, we would be exposed to higher severance costs and potential impairment charges from reductions in the fair value of our equipment. As previously reported, we have six jack up rigs currently under construction or on order for delivery during 2009 2011. These projects will require approximately an additional $850 million to complete, which may exceed our operating cash flows during this period and currently available borrowing capacity. With the prospect of reduced operating cash flows and uncertain access to additional capital, we have recently cancelled the fourth 240C rig. We have also suspended further construction of the third 240C and the fourth EXL class rig pending a decision in the coming months about whether to go forward with those rigs. If market conditions deteriorate further, we could be forced to accept unfavorable financing terms, if available, in order to complete construction. If financing is unavailable, we could be forced to further reduce our construction program to preserve adequate liquidity, which would expose us to cancellation fees. Manufacturing Operations We have manufacturing facilities in Longview and Houston, Texas and Vicksburg, Mississippi that collectively produce mining and timber equipment, alloy steel and steel plate, and drilling rigs and various rig components under two operating segments: Drilling Products and Systems and Mining, Forestry and Steel Products. The Drilling Products and Systems segment provides equipment, parts and services for the drilling industry. Featured products include complete jack up rigs, rig kits and component packages, primary drilling equipment such as mud pumps, drawworks, top drives and rotary tables, and electrical components such as variable speed motors and drives. The segment built the first offshore jack up drilling rig in 1955 and has designed or built more than 200 rigs since, including all 22 in our fleet. During 2008, Drilling Products and Systems completed construction of our fourth Tarzan Class rig, the J. P. Bussell, and our first 240C class rig, the Rowan Mississippi, and made significant progress on the construction of the second 240C class rig, the Ralph Coffman. The Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment produces large wheeled mining and timber equipment and related parts and carbon and alloy steel and steel plate. Our revenues are greatly influenced by the timing of product shipments, and our profitability is impacted by the mix of product sales. Original equipment sales, for example, have traditionally yielded lower margins than the related after market parts sales. Land rigs and component packages typically require more costs for commissioning than do individual pumps and other drilling equipment, and often carry a package discount. Thus, our gross margins are typically higher on equipment sales than on rigs and component packages. 37 Table of Contents 2008 Compared to 2007 The following table highlights the performance of our Drilling Products and Systems segment during 2008 compared to 2007 (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 493.5 100 % $ 498.6 100 % Operating costs (421.5 ) (85 ) (426.6 ) (86 ) Depreciation expense (9.5 ) (2 ) (11.7 ) (2 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (25.1 ) (5 ) (17.2 ) (3 ) Material charges and other operating expenses (81.9 ) (17 ) Losses on property disposals (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Operating income $ (44.6 ) (9 ) $ 43.0 9 Our Drilling Products and Systems segment sustained a $5.1 million or 1% decrease in revenues in 2008, which featured the following: $175.4 million associated with 16 land rigs and component packages shipped in 2008, up from $148.3 million in 2007; $153.5 million recognized on eight rig kit projects in 2008, up from $116.9 million in 2007; $41.5 million from 63 mud pumps shipped in 2008, down from $49.8 million and 70 pumps in 2007; $14.9 million related to drive and control system packages, down from $33.4 million in 2007; $12.9 million from 216 motors shipped in 2008, down from $15.2 million in 2007; and $7.7 million from custom fabrication work, down from $27.9 million in 2007. Our 2007 operating results included $41.6 million of revenues and a $15.8 million loss on the external rig construction project which required many more labor hours than we originally anticipated. There were no such revenues in 2008. Thus, as is shown in the preceding table, our average margin over operating costs increased slightly to 15% of revenues in 2008 from 14% in 2007. Depreciation expense incurred by Drilling Products and Systems in 2008 decreased by $2.2 million or 19% over 2007, due primarily to incremental depreciation related to a land rig lease transaction during 2007. Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $7.9 million or 46% in 2008, due primarily to higher expenses related to our sales and marketing efforts. As discussed further under Outlook on page 41, the prospects of our Drilling Products and Systems have weakened dramatically over the past few months. Thus, our 2008 operating results included material charges and other operating expenses of $81.9 million, which included a $62.4 million charge for estimated surplus inventory, $10.9 million for goodwill impairment, $6.4 million of allocated monetization costs and $2.2 million for severance costs incurred in connection with headcount reductions. Our 2008 Drilling Products and Systems operating results shown in the preceding table exclude the effects of the approximately $383 million of products and services provided to our drilling division during the year, most of which was attributable to construction progress on the Rowan Mississippi, the J. P. Bussell and the Ralph Coffman. 38 Table of Contents The following table highlights the performance of our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment during 2008 compared to 2007 (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 267.6 100 % $ 213.8 100 % Operating costs (203.3 ) (76 ) (169.9 ) (79 ) Depreciation expense (6.1 ) (2 ) (5.3 ) (2 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (20.8 ) (8 ) (9.4 ) (5 ) Material charges and other operating expenses (4.7 ) (2 ) Losses on property disposals and other (0.1 ) (0.1 ) Operating income $ 32.6 12 $ 29.1 14 Our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment achieved an aggregate $53.8 million or 25% increase in revenues in 2008, which featured the following: $107.9 million of equipment revenues in 2008, up from $94.9 million in 2007; shipments of mining loaders and forestry stackers totaled 29 units in 2008, down from 30 units in 2007, though 16 of the 2008 units were the larger L 1850 model which carry a higher selling price, up from 13 larger units in 2007; $71.9 million from parts sales in 2008, up from $62.6 million in 2007; $66.9 million from steel plate revenues in 2008, up from $41.2 million in 2007; shipments totaled 61,900 tons in 2008, up by 9,000 tons or 17% over 2007, and the mix changed from 51% external in 2007 to 59% external in 2008, yielding a 33% increase in external volume between years. Thus, as is shown in the preceding table, our average margin on operating costs increased to 24% of revenues in 2008 from 21% in 2007. Depreciation expense incurred by Mining, Forestry and Steel Products in 2008 increased by $.8 million or 15% from 2007, due to machinery and equipment additions made in the previous year to increase our manufacturing capacity. Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $11.4 million or 121% in 2008, due primarily to higher expenses related to our sales and marketing efforts and increased amounts of professional fees and other shared administrative costs that are allocated between our manufacturing segments based upon revenues. Our 2008 operating results included charges and other operating expenses of $4.7 million, which included $3.5 million of allocated monetization costs and $1.2 million for goodwill impairment. 2007 Compared to 2006 The following table highlights the performance of our Drilling Products and Systems segment during 2007 compared to 2006 (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 498.6 100 % $ 241.0 100 % Operating costs (426.6 ) (86 ) (201.1 ) (83 ) Depreciation expense (11.7 ) (2 ) (8.1 ) (3 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (17.2 ) (3 ) (8.5 ) (4 ) Gains (losses) on property disposals and other (0.1 ) 0.2 Operating income $ 43.0 9 $ 23.5 10 39 Table of Contents Our Drilling Products and Systems segment achieved an aggregate $257.6 million or 107% increase in revenues in 2007, which featured the following: $148.3 million associated with 13 land rigs and component packages shipped in 2007, up from $7.7 million in 2006; $116.9 million recognized on eight rig kit projects in 2007, up from $36.0 million in 2006; $49.8 million from 70 mud pumps shipped in 2007, up from $44.3 million and 69 pumps in 2006; $41.6 million recognized on the external rig construction project which was completed in June 2007, down from $67.7 million recognized in 2006; $33.4 million related to drive and control system packages, up from $13.4 million in 2006; $27.9 million from custom fabrication work, up from $18.5 million in 2006; and $15.2 million from 271 motors shipped in 2007, up from $9.6 million in 2006. Our 2007 Drilling Products and Systems operating results included a $15.8 million loss on the external rig construction project which required many more labor hours than we originally anticipated. Efforts made in late 2006 and early 2007 to deliver the Hank Boswell three months ahead of schedule, rebuild the Rowan Louisiana and assist with contractually required modifications to our Middle East rigs had the effect of delaying progress on the external rig construction project. Thus, as is shown in the preceding table, our average margin on operating costs decreased to 14% of revenues in 2007 from 17% in 2006. Depreciation expense incurred by Drilling Products and Systems in 2007 increased by $3.6 million or 44% over 2006, due to machinery, equipment and building additions to expand capacity at our manufacturing facilities. Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $8.7 million or 102% in 2007, due to higher selling related expenses and incremental staffing required to facilitate the growth in operations discussed immediately above and increased amounts of professional fees and other shared administrative costs that are allocated between our manufacturing segments based upon revenues. Our 2007 Drilling Products and Systems operating results shown in the preceding table exclude the effects of the approximately $263 million of products and services provided at cost to our drilling division during the year, most of which was attributable to construction progress on the J. P. Bussell, the two 240C class jack ups and the six new land rigs. The following table highlights the performance of our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment during 2007 compared to 2006 (dollars in millions): 2007 2006 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 213.8 100 % $ 202.3 100 % Operating costs (169.9 ) (79 ) (171.1 ) (85 ) Depreciation expense (5.3 ) (2 ) (4.3 ) (2 ) Selling, general and administrative expenses (9.4 ) (5 ) (13.2 ) (7 ) Gains (losses) on property disposals and other (0.1 ) 0.8 1 Operating income $ 29.1 14 $ 14.5 7 Our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment achieved an aggregate $11.5 million or 6% increase in revenues in 2007, which featured the following: $94.9 million of equipment revenues in 2007, down from $101.0 million in 2006; shipments of mining loaders and forestry stackers totaled 30 units in 2007, down from 35 units in 2006, though 13 were the larger L 1850 and L 2350 models which carry a higher selling price; $62.6 million from parts sales in 2007, up from $58.0 million in 2006 40 Table of Contents $41.2 million from steel plate revenues in 2007, up from $23.1 million in 2006; shipments totaled 52,900 tons in 2007, up by 10,800 tons or 26% over 2006, and the mix changed from 40% external in 2006 to 51% external in 2007, yielding a 63% increase in external volume between years. Our 2006 Mining, Forestry and Steel Products operating results included $7.8 million in environmental remediation costs incurred following detection of traces of radioactive material at our steel mill. Thus, as is shown in the preceding table, our average margin on operating costs increased to 21% of revenues in 2007 from 15% in 2006. Depreciation expense incurred by Mining, Forestry and Steel Products in 2007 increased by $1.0 million or 23% from 2006, due to the expansion of our steel mill along with machinery and equipment additions to increase capacity at our manufacturing facilities. Selling, general and administrative costs decreased by $3.8 million or 29% in 2007, primarily due to reduced professional fees and other shared administrative costs that are allocated between our manufacturing segments based upon revenues. Outlook Our Manufacturing operations are impacted by world commodities prices. Our Drilling Products and Systems operations are closely tied to the condition of the overall drilling industry and its demand for equipment, parts and services which, as discussed above, is heavily influenced by oil and natural gas prices. In addition, the prospects for our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment are affected by prices for copper, iron ore, coal and timber. Over the past several months, many commodity prices have declined from their historically high levels due to slowing worldwide demand. This trend, combined with the weakness in global capital markets, has forced many of our customers to preserve liquidity, and we have begun to experience reduced demand for certain products and services. We cannot accurately predict the duration of current business conditions or quantify their impact on our operations. Our Manufacturing operations will be adversely affected if conditions remain weak or deteriorate further. Our external manufacturing backlog, which consists of executed contracts and customer commitments, was approximately $562 million at December 31, 2008, compared to $348 million at December 31, 2007, and included $491 million from Drilling Products and Systems. The backlog included $304 million associated with 29 land rigs and component packages scheduled for delivery in 2009, $79 million related to three long term rig kit construction projects in process that are expected to run through early 2010, and the remaining $179 million comprised of mining loaders, log stackers, ad hoc drilling equipment and related parts orders that we expect to fulfill during 2009. Facing reduced liquidity, certain of our customers have sought to modify existing orders by delaying deliveries and related payments. Others are attempting to reduce or cancel orders altogether. Though we fully intend to enforce our contractual rights, such actions could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows to the extent that collections are delayed, administrative costs are increased and we are otherwise unable to fully recover the in process cost attributable to such orders. We estimate that as much as $236 million, or 42% of our December 31, 2008 backlog, is at risk of being delayed or canceled. Should market conditions worsen, these actions may intensify, though we cannot assess that likelihood or the resulting impact on our results of operations or cash flows. On March 31, 2008, we announced that our Board of Directors had decided to pursue a monetization of our investment in LTI during 2008, and that if that monetization were accomplished through an initial public offering or private sale of all or a portion of our Manufacturing operations (but not through a public or private merger), we would repurchase at least $400 million of our outstanding common stock. On November 4, 2008, we announced that recent capital markets and commodity price weakness had adversely affected opportunities for monetizing our investment in LTI for what we believe to be adequate value for our stockholders, and that we are not pursuing any further negotiations with potential partners. We will continue to review all strategic options, including a spin off of LTI to our stockholders, but do not anticipate that a transaction, if any, will be completed until capital markets conditions improve significantly. 41 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Key balance sheet amounts and ratios for 2008 and 2007 were as follows (dollars in millions): December 31, 2008 2007 Cash and cash equivalents $ 222.4 $ 284.5 Current assets $ 1,369.2 $ 1,303.0 Current liabilities $ 744.6 $ 495.6 Current ratio 1.84 2.63 Current maturities of long term debt $ 64.9 $ 64.9 Long term debt $ 355.6 $ 420.5 Stockholders equity $ 2,659.8 $ 2,348.4 Long term debt/total capitalization .12 .15 Reflected in the comparison above are the effects of the following sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents in 2008, with comparable amounts for 2007: Sources (Uses) of Cash and Cash Equivalents 2008 2007 Net operating cash flows $ 694.5 $ 432.6 Net change in restricted cash balance 50.0 106.1 Net proceeds from asset disposals 97.6 45.8 Proceeds from equity compensation and debenture plans 33.8 13.2 Capital expenditures (829.1 ) (462.6 ) Debt repayments (64.9 ) (64.9 ) Cash dividend payments (45.0 ) (44.4 ) All other 1.1 0.7 Total sources (uses) $ (62.0 ) $ 26.5 Operating Cash Flows Operating cash flows in 2008 included non cash or non operating adjustments to our net income totaling $152 million plus a net reduction in working capital of $132 million. Non cash or non operating adjustments included depreciation expense of $141 million, deferred income taxes of $51 million and compensation expense of $16 million, partially offset by net gains on asset disposals of $68 million. Working capital was reduced in 2008 as increases in trade payables, income taxes payable and deferred revenues of $129 million, $32 million and $63 million, respectively, more than offset an additional investment in inventories of $93 million. Inventories had increased in recent years as product lines were being expanded to position our Manufacturing operations for further growth. This trend continued for much of 2008 when, as a result of the dramatic decline in commodity prices and profound capital market weakness over the last half of the year, we began to experience reduced demand for certain products and services in the fourth quarter. The amount shown above is net of an approximately $71 million incremental inventory valuation allowance recorded during 2008. The increase in deferred revenues during 2008 reflects additional customer advances toward future product deliveries while fourth quarter income tax payments were deferred as part of Hurricane Ike relief. The increase in accounts payable reflects efforts to better manage the growth in capital and other expenditures. 42 Table of Contents Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures in 2008 included: $75 million towards completion of our fourth Tarzan Class jack up rig, the J.P. Bussell, which was delivered and commenced operations in the Gulf of Mexico in November; see further discussion below under Contingent Liabilities; $94 million towards completion of our first 240C class jack up rig, the Rowan Mississippi, which was also delivered and commenced operations in the Gulf of Mexico in November; $106 million for our second 240C rig, the Ralph Coffman, which is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of 2009; $119 million for the Cecil Provine, which we purchased in early July 2008 following the conclusion of our operating lease agreement; $58 million towards the construction of four new 2000 horsepower land rigs, two of which commenced operations in 2008; the third rig was delivered and commenced operations in February 2009 and the fourth rig should be completed and begin operating by the end of the first quarter of 2009. In late 2007, we announced plans to construct two additional 240C class jack up rigs, to be financed from available cash flows and delivered in 2010 and 2011. Capital expenditures in 2008 included $43 million towards construction of the third 240C rig and $12 million towards construction of the fourth 240C rig. With the prospect of reduced operating cash flows and uncertain access to additional capital, we announced on January 26, 2009 that we were cancelling the fourth 240C rig and suspending construction of the third 240C rig until at least mid year 2009. A portion of amounts expended toward the fourth 240C class rig will be applied to other projects. Our fourth quarter 2008 operating results included an $11.8 million impairment charge for the estimated unrecoverable cost of amounts committed toward the fourth 240C rig, including a $6 million charge for expected deliveries in early 2009. We have commitments outstanding and are subject to cancellation fees on the third 240C rig totaling approximately $26 million. Should our cash flows and available borrowing capacity prove to be insufficient, if we are unable to obtain alternative financing or if market conditions continue to deteriorate, we may elect to cancel construction of the third 240C rig, in which case we would probably incur an impairment charge for a significant portion of the $73 million of expenditures made and to be made. Also in late 2007, we signed contracts with Keppel AmFELS, Inc. (Keppel) to have four EXL (formerly Super 116E) class rigs constructed at its Brownsville, Texas shipyard, to be financed from available cash flows and delivered in 2010 and 2011. Each rig is expected to cost between $185 190 million, with more than a third of that amount attributable to the design, kit components and drilling equipment to be provided by our Manufacturing division. Capital expenditures in 2008 included $150 million towards construction of the EXL rigs, including $16.5 related to the fourth rig. With the prospect of reduced operating cash flows and uncertain access to additional capital, we have suspended activity on the fourth rig pending a decision in the coming months about whether to go forward with that rig. We have commitments outstanding and are subject to cancellation fees on the fourth rig totaling approximately $30 million, including a $21 million cancellation payment to Keppel. Should our cash flows be insufficient, we could be forced to accept unfavorable financing terms in order to complete construction of and avoid penalties on the first EXL three rigs. Should we cancel construction of the fourth EXL rig, we would probably incur an impairment charge for a significant portion of the $57 million of expenditures made and to be made. The remainder of 2008 capital expenditures was primarily for major enhancements to existing offshore rigs and manufacturing facilities. Our 2009 capital budget, as approved by our Board of Directors, is approximately $560 million, and includes $87 million toward construction of the second 240C class rig, $265 million toward construction of the first three EXL class rigs and $30 million for contractually required rig upgrades, and gives effect to the cancellation of our fourth 240C rig and the suspension of construction activities on our third 240C rig and fourth EXL rig. We will periodically review and adjust the capital budget as necessary based upon current and forecasted cash flows and liquidity, anticipated market conditions in our drilling and manufacturing businesses, the availability of financing sources and alternative uses of capital to enhance shareholder value. Any such adjustments, 43 Table of Contents including those that may result from a decision to resume construction of the two suspended rigs, require Board approval. Long Term Debt Rowans first two Tarzan Class jack up rigs and each of our four Super Gorilla class rigs were substantially financed through long term bank loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Transportations Maritime Administration (MARAD). Under the MARAD Title XI program, we obtained financing as a reimbursement for qualifying expenditures up to a pre approved limit and based upon actual construction progress. Outstanding borrowings initially bear a floating rate of interest and notes require semi annual payments of principal and accrued interest. The notes are secured by a preferred mortgage on the rig. The following table summarizes the status of each of our Title XI borrowings at December 31, 2008 (dollars in millions). Repayment Repayment Final Rig Delivery Borrowings Repayments Balance Interest Rate Dates Amounts Maturity Gorilla V Dec 1998 $ 153.1 $ 127.6 $ 25.6 6.94%, 6.15% Jan 1, July 1 $ 6.4 July 2010 Gorilla VI June 2000 171.0 121.1 49.9 5.88% Mar 15, Sep 15 7.1 Mar 2012 Gorilla VII Dec 2001 185.4 108.2 77.2 2.8% Apr 20, Oct 20 7.7 Oct 2013 Bob Palmer Aug 2003 187.3 52.0 135.3 3.47% floating Jan 15, July 15 5.2 July 2021 Scooter Yeargain April 2004 91.2 27.4 63.8 4.33% May 1, Nov 1 3.0 May 2019 Bob Keller Aug 2005 89.7 20.9 68.7 3.37% floating May 10, Nov 10 3.0 May 2020 Total $ 877.7 $ 457.2 $ 420.5 $ 32.4 Our outstanding Bob Palmer and Bob Keller borrowings bear interest at a short term commercial paper rate plus .25% and .15%, respectively. Rowan may fix these interest rates at any time and must fix them by July 15, 2011 and August 31, 2009, respectively. Our debt agreements contain provisions that require minimum levels of working capital and stockholders equity and limit the amount of long term debt and, in the event of noncompliance, restrict investment activities, asset purchases and sales, lease obligations, borrowings and mergers or acquisitions. Our debt agreements also specify the minimum insurance coverage for our financed rigs. The extent of hurricane damage sustained throughout the Gulf Coast area in recent years has dramatically increased the cost and reduced the availability of insurance coverage for windstorm losses. During our April 2006 policy renewal, we determined that windstorm coverage meeting the requirements of our existing debt agreements was cost prohibitive. We obtained from MARAD a waiver of the original insurance requirements in return for providing additional security, including restricted and unrestricted cash balances. On March 31, 2008, in connection with our policy renewal, the additional security provisions were modified and our restricted cash requirement was eliminated. In addition, our unrestricted cash requirement was reduced from $31 million to $25 million. We remain subject to restrictions on the use of certain insurance proceeds should we experience further losses. Each of these additional security provisions will be released by MARAD if we are able to obtain windstorm coverage that satisfies the original terms of our debt agreements. On June 23, 2008, we entered into a three year $155 million revolving credit facility, which we intend to use, as necessary, for general corporate purposes. The underlying credit agreement limits new borrowings, requires minimum cash flows, provides that the facility will not be available in the event of a material adverse change in our condition, operations, business, assets, liabilities or ability to perform, and otherwise contains restrictions similar those noted above. On July 7, 2008, we borrowed $80 million under the credit facility to complete the Cecil Provine purchase, and repaid such amount in full on August 4, 2008. We had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at December 31, 2008. Despite the recent weakness in global credit markets, we believe that funding under the credit facility continues to be available, if necessary. We were in compliance with each of our debt covenants at December 31, 2008 and, based on current projections, we do not expect to encounter difficulty complying in 2009. Our most onerous financial covenant is the requirement to maintain at least $25 million of unrestricted cash, and we were $197 million in excess of that requirement and had another $155 million of available borrowing capacity at December 31, 2008. 44 Table of Contents Pension Obligations We have contributed $179 million to our defined benefit pension plans over the past six years. Minimum contribution amounts are determined based upon actuarial calculations of pension assets and liabilities that involve, among other things, assumptions about long term asset returns and interest rates. Similar calculations were used to estimate pension costs and obligations as reflected in our consolidated financial statements, which showed an unfunded pension liability of $298 million at December 31, 2008. Although we amended the benefit formula for new Drilling division plan entrants effective January 1, 2008 in order to reduce the rate at which the plans liabilities are growing, we will need to make significant pension contributions over the next several years regardless of future plan asset performance, and even more funding would be required if assets decline. While the Pension Protection Act of 2006 generally increased funding requirements for underfunded plans, recent legislation relaxed such requirements in the wake of the profound capital market weakness over the last several months of 2008. We currently expect minimum pension contributions of approximately $42 million for 2009. Retirement benefits to be paid from our pension plans are expected to average over $30 million annually over the next ten years. Cash Dividends On February 24, 2006, we paid a special cash dividend of $.25 per common share to stockholders of record on February 8, 2006. On May 9, 2006, we announced a regular quarterly dividend of $.10 per common share, which we have paid approximately every three months since. On January 23, 2009, in light of the commitments under our newbuild program, the dramatic decrease in world oil prices and consequent reduction in worldwide demand for oil services and the severe illiquidity in world credit markets, our Board of Directors eliminated our quarterly cash dividend. Future dividends, if any, will only be paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors. At December 31, 2008, we had approximately $197 million of retained earnings available for distribution to stockholders under the most restrictive provisions of our debt agreements. Proceeds from Asset Disposals In October 2005, we sold a rig for approximately $60 million in cash, which was received over a 15 month period ending in January 2007, at which point the title to the rig was transferred to the buyer. We retained ownership of much of the drilling equipment on the rig, which was sold in 2006 and 2007, and continued to provide (through February 2007) a number of operating personnel under a separate services agreement. The original transaction was accounted for as a sales type lease with the expected gain on the sale and imputed interest income of approximately $46 million deferred until the net book value of the rig had been recovered. During 2007, we received all remaining payments totaling $23.4 million and recognized such amount as additional gain on the sale. Another $14.1 million of gain was realized in 2007 on the June sale of our Alaska drilling camps. During 2008, we sold our London office building for $17.6 million and a land rig for $10.8 million, recognizing gains of $14.5 million and $4.7 million, respectively. During this period, we also received approximately $16.5 million in cash and recognized a $5.4 million gain in connection with the sale of our Fourchon, Louisiana service facility. On September 13, 2008, we lost the jack up rig Rowan Anchorage during Hurricane Ike. The rig was insured for $60 million and subject to a $17.5 million deductible. During the fourth quarter of 2008, we received the full $42.5 million of insurance proceeds and recognized a $37.1 million gain. 45 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2008 (dollars in millions): Payments Due by Period Total Within 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Contractual Obligations Long term debt and interest(1) $ 496.9 $ 81.0 $ 140.6 $ 98.0 $ 177.3 Purchase obligations, including capital expenditures 460.0 329.0 131.0 Operating leases 13.3 5.8 4.8 0.7 2.0 Total $ 970.2 $ 415.8 $ 276.4 $ 98.7 $ 179.3 (1) Amounts represent contractual principal and interest payments. Interest amounts reflect either stated fixed rates or assume current floating rates remain constant throughout the period. We periodically employ letters of credit or other bank issued guarantees in the normal course of our businesses, and were contingently liable for performance under such agreements to the extent of approximately $46 million at December 31, 2008. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments. Based on current and anticipated near term operating levels, we believe that operating cash flows together with existing working capital and our currently available borrowing capacity will be adequate to sustain planned capital expenditures and debt service and other requirements at least through the remainder of 2009. We currently have no other available credit facilities, and if the capital markets do not improve significantly, we may be unable to obtain additional debt or equity financing, should that become necessary. Contingent Liabilities During 2005, we lost four offshore rigs, including the Rowan Halifax, and incurred significant damage on a fifth as a result of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita. We also lost another offshore rig during Hurricane Ike in 2008. Since 2005, we have been working to locate the lost or damaged rigs, salvage related equipment, remove debris, wreckage and pollutants from the water, mark or clear navigational hazards and clear rights of way. At December 31, 2008, we had incurred $206.5 million of costs related to such efforts, of which $153.3 million had been reimbursed through insurance, leaving $53.2 million included in Receivables. We expect to incur additional costs in 2009 to fulfill our obligations to remove wreckage and debris in amounts that will depend on the extent and nature of work ultimately required and the duration thereof. At this time, we believe that we have adequate insurance coverage and will be reimbursed for costs incurred and to be incurred. We leased the jack up Rowan Halifax under a charter agreement that commenced in 1984 and was scheduled to expire in March 2008. The rig was insured for $43.4 million prior to being lost during Hurricane Rita in 2005. We believe the insured value satisfied the requirements of the charter agreement, and by a margin sufficient to cover the $6.3 million carrying value of our equipment installed on the rig. However, the owner of the rig claimed that the rig should have been insured for its fair market value and is seeking recovery from us for compensation above the insured value. Thus, we assumed no insurance proceeds related to the Rowan Halifax and recorded a charge during 2005 for the full carrying value of our equipment. On November 3, 2005, we filed a declaratory judgment action styled Rowan Companies, Inc. vs. Textron Financial Corporation and Wilmington Trust Company as Owner Trustee of the Rowan Halifax 116 C Jack Up Rig in the 215th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas. The owner filed a similar declaratory judgment action, claiming a value of approximately $83 million for the rig. The owners motion for summary judgment was granted on January 25, 2007 which, unless overturned on appeal, would make us liable to the owner for the approximately $50 million difference between the owners claim and the insurance coverage, including interest and costs to date. We continue to believe that our interpretation of the charter agreement is correct, and we are vigorously pursuing an appeal to overturn the summary judgment ruling. We do not believe, therefore, that it is probable that we have incurred a loss and have made no accrual for such at December 31, 2008. 46 Table of Contents During 2004, we learned that the Environmental and Natural Resources Division, Environmental Crimes Section of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) had begun conducting a criminal investigation of environmental matters involving several of our offshore drilling rigs, including a rig known as the Rowan Midland, which at various times operated in the Gulf of Mexico. In 2007, we entered into a plea agreement with the DOJ under which we agreed to pay fines and community service payments totaling $9 million and be subject to unsupervised probation for a period of three years. During the period of unsupervised probation, we must ensure that we commit no further criminal violations of federal, state, or local laws or regulations and must also continue to implement our comprehensive Environmental Management System Plan. Subsequent to the conduct at issue, we sold the Rowan Midland to a third party. The Environmental Protection Agency has approved a compliance agreement with us which, among other things, contains a certification that the conditions giving rise to the violations to which we entered guilty pleas have been corrected. If we fully comply with the terms of the compliance agreement, we believe that we will not be suspended or debarred from entering into or participating in contracts with the U.S. Government or any of its agencies. On January 3, 2008, a civil lawsuit styled State of Louisiana, ex. rel. Charles C. Foti, Jr. , Attorney General vs. Rowan Companies, Inc. was filed in the U.S. District Court, Eastern District of Texas, Marshall Division, seeking damages, civil penalties and costs and expenses for alleged commission of maritime torts and violations of environmental and other laws and regulations involving the Rowan Midland and other facilities in areas in or near Louisiana. Subsequently, the case was transferred to U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas, Houston Division. We intend to vigorously defend our position in this case but cannot estimate any potential liability at this time. In June 2007, we received a subpoena for documents from the U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Louisiana relating to a grand jury hearing. The agency requesting the information is the U.S. Department of the Interior, Office of Inspector General Investigations. The documents requested include all records relating to use of our entertainment facilities and entertainment expenses for a former employee of the Minerals Management Service, U.S. Department of Interior, and other records relating to items of value provided to any official or employee of the U.S. Government. We have fully cooperated with the subpoena and have received no further requests. The construction of our fourth Tarzan Class jack up rig, the J. P. Bussell, was originally subcontracted to Signal International LLC (Signal), and scheduled for delivery in the third quarter of 2007 at a total cost of approximately $145 million. As a result of various problems encountered on the project, we overtook construction of the rig in March 2008 as permitted under the construction contract. The rig was delivered more than one year behind schedule and its final cost was approximately 40% over the original estimate. Accordingly, we declared Signal in breach of contract and initiated court proceedings styled Rowan Companies, Inc. and LeTourneau Technologies, Inc. vs. Signal International LLC in the 269th Judicial District Court of Harris County, Texas to recover the cost to complete the rig over and above the agreed contract price, as well as other damages, plus interest. Signal filed a separate counterclaim against us styled Signal International LLC vs. LeTourneau, Inc. in the U.S. District Court, Southern District of Texas, Houston Division, alleging breach of contract and claiming unspecified damages for cost overruns. That case has been administratively stayed in favor of the State Court proceeding filed by the Company. We expect that Signal will claim damages for amounts owed and additional costs incurred, totaling in excess of $20 million. We intend to vigorously defend and prosecute our rights under the contract. We do not believe that it is probable that we will be held liable for the claims brought by Signal, and have made no accrual for such at December 31, 2008. We are involved in various other legal proceedings incidental to our businesses and are vigorously defending our position in all such matters. We believe that there are no other known contingencies, claims or lawsuits that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Critical Accounting Policies and Management Estimates Rowans significant accounting policies are outlined in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements beginning on page 57 of this Form 10 K. These policies, and management judgments, assumptions and estimates made in their application underlie reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 47 Table of Contents statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that our most critical accounting policies and management estimates involve revenue recognition (primarily upfront service fees for equipment moves and modifications and longer term manufacturing projects), inventory (primarily valuation allowances for excess and obsolete inventories), property and depreciation (particularly capitalizable costs, useful lives and salvage values), carrying values of long lived assets and goodwill, and pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs (specifically assumptions used in actuarial calculations), as changes in such policies and or estimates would produce significantly different amounts from those reported herein. Revenue recognition. Our drilling contracts generally provide for payment on a day rate basis, and revenues are recognized as the work progresses with the passage of time. We frequently receive lump sum payments at the outset of a drilling assignment as upfront service fees for equipment moves or modifications, and such payments (and related costs) are recognized as drilling revenues (and expenses) over the contract period. At December 31, 2008, we had deferred $47.6 million of revenues and $32.9 million of costs related to such upfront service fees, with such amounts primarily related to mobilization and modification activities in connection with Middle East and West Africa drilling contracts. We also recognize revenue for certain rebillable costs. Each rebillable item and amount is stipulated in our drilling contract with the customer, and such items and amounts frequently vary between contracts. We have recognized rebillable costs on the gross basis, as both revenues and expenses, as we are the primary obligor in the arrangement, we have discretion in supplier selection, we are involved in determining product or service specifications and we assume full credit risk related to the rebillable costs. We generally recognize manufacturing sales and related costs when title passes as products are shipped. Revenues from longer term manufacturing projects such as rigs and rig kits are recognized on the percentage of completion basis using project costs incurred relative to total estimated project costs. A rig kit includes selected rig components and parts manufactured over a six to nine month period in our Longview, Texas facility. A rig construction project typically occurs over a two year period at our Vicksburg, Mississippi shipyard and includes a significant labor cost component for fabrication and assembly. Costs are recorded separately for each project, and by significant activity or component within each project, and include materials issued to the project, labor expenses that are incurred directly for the project and overhead expenses that are allocated across all projects at consistent rates per labor hour. Incurred costs include only those that measure project work performed. Material costs incurred, for example, do not include materials purchased but remaining in inventory. Only when such materials have been used in production on the project are they included in incurred project costs. The determination of total estimated project costs is performed monthly based upon then current information. This process involves an evaluation of progress towards project milestones and an assessment of work left to complete each project activity or component, and is based on physical observations by project managers and engineers. An estimate of project costs is then developed for each significant activity or component based upon the assessment of project status, actual costs incurred to date and outstanding commitments for project materials and services. We do not recognize any estimated profit until such projects are at least 10% complete, though a full provision is made immediately for any anticipated losses. During 2007, we recognized a $15.8 million loss on our external rig construction project, bringing the total loss on the project to approximately $17.9 million. This was the first rig construction project for an external customer that we had performed in over a decade, and we have no further plans for additional external rig construction projects at this time. With respect to our rig kits, due to the smaller size and duration of the projects and lesser labor cost component, we have not experienced any significant fluctuations in the percentage of completion measurements, nor have we incurred any losses on such projects. During 2008, we recognized $153.5 million of manufacturing revenues and $93.1 million of costs related to rig kit projects on the percentage of completion basis. Inventory. Inventory is carried at the lower of average cost or estimated net realizable value. Costs include labor, material and an allocation of production overhead. We determine valuation allowances or reserves for inventory based on historical usage of inventory on hand, assumptions about future demand based on market conditions, and estimates about potential alternative uses, which are usually limited. Our inventory generally consists of spare parts, work in process, and raw materials to support ongoing manufacturing operations and the Companys installed base of drilling, mining and timber equipment. Customers rely on us to stock these specialized 48 Table of Contents items to ensure that their equipment can be repaired and serviced in a timely manner. The estimated carrying value of our inventory therefore ultimately depends upon demand driven by oil, natural gas and other commodity prices, general economic conditions worldwide and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell, among other factors. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, our inventory reserves totaled 13% and 3% of gross inventory, respectively. Recent declines in oil and natural gas prices, the onset of global recession and weakness in capital markets provided the basis for our reduced estimates of the future usage of our drilling equipment inventories which, coupled with the earlier growth in such inventories in order to fuel product line expansion, resulted in the significant increase in inventory reserves at December 31, 2008. Further deterioration in worldwide demand for oil, natural gas and certain other commodities, or the development of new technologies which make older drilling, mining and timber equipment technologies obsolete, could require us to record additional reserves to reduce the value of our inventory. Property and depreciation. Expenditures for new property or enhancements to existing property are capitalized and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Capitalized cost includes labor expended during installation and, on newly constructed assets, a portion of interest cost incurred during the construction period. We provide depreciation under the straight line method from the date an asset is placed into service based upon estimated service lives ranging up to 40 years and salvage values ranging up to 20%. We continue to operate 13 offshore jack up rigs that were placed into service at various dates during the 1971 1986 period. Many of those rigs had met or far exceeded their assigned useful lives of 12 15 years when our next rig, the Super Gorilla class Gorilla V, was delivered in 1998. The Super Gorilla class and the subsequent Tarzan Class and 240C class have been assigned 25 year useful lives and are specifically designed to achieve greater drilling performance while encountering tougher well conditions. Each class of rig employs technological advances in load bearing capability, power distribution and solids control designed to provide more efficient drilling to greater depths, which should help to ensure its continuing economic life to the Company. Impairment of Long lived Assets and Goodwill. We evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment, primarily our drilling rigs, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such rigs may not be recoverable. Generally, extended periods of idle time and or our inability to contract rigs at economical rates are an indication that a rig may be impaired. However, the offshore drilling industry has historically been highly cyclical and it is not unusual for rigs to be unutilized or underutilized for extended periods of time and subsequently resume full or near full utilization when business cycles change. Likewise, during periods of excess supply, rigs are frequently contracted at or near cash break even rates for extended periods. Impairment situations may arise with respect to specific individual rigs, groups of rigs, such as a specific type of drilling rig, or rigs in a certain geographic region. Our rigs are mobile and may generally be moved from markets with excess supply, if economically feasible. We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists. The goodwill impairment test requires us to identify reporting units and estimate the fair value of those units as of the testing date. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, its goodwill is considered not impaired. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, we estimate the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to such excess. Based on our goodwill impairment analysis performed as of December 31, 2008, goodwill was fully impaired at December 31, 2008, and we have charged the carrying value of $13.6 million to income. Asset impairment evaluations are, by nature, highly subjective. In most instances, they involve expectations of future cash flows to be generated by our drilling rigs and are based on managements judgments and assumptions regarding future industry conditions and operations, as well as managements estimates of future expected utilization, contract rates, expense levels and capital requirements of our drilling rigs. The estimates, judgments and assumptions used by management in the application of our asset impairment policies reflect both historical experience and an assessment of current operational, industry, market, economic and political environments. The use of different estimates, judgments, assumptions and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations would likely result in materially different carrying values of assets and operating results. 49 Table of Contents Pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs. As previously mentioned, our pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs are based upon actuarial computations that reflect our assumptions about future events, including long term asset returns, interest rates, annual compensation increases, mortality rates and other factors. Key assumptions for December 31, 2008 included discount rates ranging from 6.11% to 6.34%, an expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets of 8% and annual healthcare cost increases ranging from 9% in 2010 to 4.5% in 2029 and beyond. The assumed discount rate is based upon the average yield for Moodys Aa rated corporate bonds and the rate of return assumption reflects a probability distribution of expected long term returns that is weighted based upon plan asset allocations. A 1 percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase our recorded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities by approximately $100 million, while a 1 percentage point change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would change annual net benefits cost by approximately $3.7 million. A 1 percentage point increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would increase 2009 other benefits costs by $0.5 million. New Accounting Pronouncements As a result of the implementation of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109, effective January 1, 2007, the Company recognized a $1.6 million decrease in Retained earnings and a $5.5 increase in Other liabilities as of that date. During 2008, the Company increased Other liabilities by $2.3 million and, at December 31, 2008, Rowan had $3.6 million of unrecognized tax benefits, all of which would reduce the Companys income tax provision if recognized. Rowan does not expect to recognize significant increases or decreases in unrecognized tax benefits during the next 12 months. Our adoption, effective January 1, 2008, of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, which establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements, did not have a material impact on our financial statements. SFAS No. 158 Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, which required that the funded status of our pension and other postretirement benefit plans be fully recognized in our December 31, 2006 Consolidated Balance Sheet, had the effect of increasing our balances for Other liabilities, Deferred income taxes and Accumulated other comprehensive loss at that date by $67.1 million, $23.5 million and $43.6 million, respectively. Though balance sheet recognition is now required for the unamortized portion of gains and losses, prior service cost and transition assets, such amounts will continue to be excluded from net periodic benefits cost and included within other comprehensive income (loss). Effective January 1, 2008, we adopted SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, Including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115. SFAS No. 159, which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at fair value, did not have a material impact on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS Rowans outstanding debt at December 31, 2008 was comprised as follows: $216.5 million of fixed rate notes bearing a weighted average annual interest rate of 4.40% and $204 million of floating rate notes bearing a weighted average annual interest rate of 3.44%. The floating rate notes consist of outstanding Bob Palmer and Bob Keller borrowings, which bear interest at a short term commercial paper rate plus .25% and .15%, respectively. Rowan may fix these interest rates at any time and must fix them by July 15, 2011 and August 31, 2009, respectively. Thus, Rowan believes that its exposure to risk of earnings loss due to changes in market interest rates is limited. In addition, the majority of Rowans transactions are carried out in United States dollars; thus, the Companys foreign currency exposure is not material. Fluctuating commodity prices affect Rowans future earnings materially to the extent that they influence demand for the Companys products and services. Rowan does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments. 50 Table of Contents
