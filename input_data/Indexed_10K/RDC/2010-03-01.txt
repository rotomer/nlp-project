ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY During 2009, our results of operations continued to benefit from contracts executed prior to the downturn that began in mid 2008 in markets for our products and services. Reduced activity levels, however, caused by the continuing global economic weakness resulted in a decline in our 2009 revenues and profitability. We are currently receiving above market day rates on several long term drilling contracts, most of which are scheduled to conclude in 2010 or 2011. Absent a rebound in drilling demand sufficient to enable a recovery in market day rates, our future results of operations would be further negatively impacted as lower market rates are realized in our reported results. Although our operations are currently profitable overall, we can provide no assurance that they will continue to be profitable. As of February 16, 2010, we had nine offshore rigs in the Middle East, eight in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, two in the North Sea, and one each offshore West Africa, Eastern Canada, Mexico and Egypt. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table highlights Rowans operating results for the years indicated (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Revenues: Drilling services $ 1,214.9 $ 1,451.6 $ 1,382.6 Manufacturing sales andservices: Drilling products and systems 369.4 493.5 498.6 Mining, forestry and steel products 185.9 267.6 213.8 Total manufacturing sales and services 555.3 761.1 712.4 Total revenues $ 1,770.2 $ 2,212.7 $ 2,095.0 Costs and expenses: Drilling services $ 742.8 $ 781.5 $ 720.8 Manufacturing sales andservices: Drilling products and systems 366.0 538.1 455.6 Mining, forestry and steel products 160.4 235.0 184.7 Total manufacturing sales and services 526.4 773.1 640.3 Total costs and expenses $ 1,269.2 $ 1,554.6 $ 1,361.1 Operating income: Drilling services $ 472.1 $ 670.1 $ 661.8 Manufacturing sales andservices: Drilling products and systems 3.4 (44.6 ) 43.0 Mining, forestry and steel products 25.5 32.6 29.1 Total manufacturing sales and services 28.9 (12.0 ) 72.1 Total operating income $ 501.0 $ 658.1 $ 733.9 Net income $ 367.5 $ 427.6 $ 483.8 As indicated in the preceding table, Rowans results of operations are primarily driven by the performance of our Drilling Services segment, which comprises about 95% of our fixed assets and, over the past three years, has generated two thirds of our aggregate revenues and 95% of our aggregate operating income. Our manufacturing division, featuring our Drilling Products and Systems segment, has led the strategic expansion and upgrade of our drilling fleet over the past decade and, in recent years, has expanded product lines and sought to grow its external business. Costs and expenses in 2008 included $111.2 million of special items, including (i) impairment charges relating to a cancelled rig construction project, the realizable value of manufacturing inventories and goodwill, (ii) professional service fees and other expenses incurred in connection with the suspended LeTourneau monetization process and (iii) severance costs in 22 Table of Contents connection with the retirement of the Companys former Chief Executive Officer in 2008 and headcount reductions. These items are described more fully in the operating segment discussions below and in Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net income includes income from operations plus the following items (in millions): 2009 2008 2007 Interest income $ 1.2 $ 6.3 $ 20.9 Interest expense (29.5 ) (18.6 ) (25.9 ) Capitalized interest 21.5 17.4 10.0 Other income (expense) net 6.9 (9.1 ) 0.2 Provision for income taxes (133.6 ) (226.5 ) (255.3 ) In 2009, the Company recognized a $25.4 million tax benefit as a result of applying our facts to a recent third party tax case that provides a more favorable tax treatment for certain foreign contracts entered into in prior years. The Company has deferred recognition of a remaining $49.2 million estimated benefit in accordance with the accounting guidelines for income tax uncertainties. The performance of each of our operating segments over the period from 2007 through 2009 is discussed more fully below. Drilling Operations Drilling Services operating results are primarily a function of the activity (or utilization) and day rates achieved by our land and offshore rig fleets. Rig activity and day rates are primarily determined by oil and gas exploration and development expenditures, which are heavily influenced by trends in oil and natural gas prices, and the availability of competitive equipment. When drilling markets are strengthening, day rates generally lag the upward trend in rig activity, and day rate increases can be more significant as utilization approaches 100%. When drilling markets are weakening, day rates are often significantly reduced in an effort to maintain utilization. Due to intense competition in the contract drilling industry, both market utilization and day rates have historically declined much faster than they have risen. Market Conditions Over the period from 2007 through mid 2008, global demand for oil and natural gas continued to increase, especially in developing nations such as China and India. At the same time, many key producers increasingly struggled with depleting reserves, requiring more drilling simply to maintain production levels. These market forces caused a dramatic increase in energy prices, and the per barrel price of oil rose from the low $50s in early 2007 to an all time high of more than $145 in July 2008. Natural gas prices followed a similar pattern during the period, though with much more volatility, generally ranging from $5.50 to $8.50 per mcf during 2007 and peaking in mid 2008 at nearly $14. As a result, drilling demand surged over the period, with all available rigs benefiting. Many of the projects were in increasingly difficult drilling environments and demanded the most capable drilling equipment. Meanwhile, the global jack up fleet, with relatively few net rig additions between 1986 and 2005, continued to age. The more capable rigs were marketable throughout the world, and were generally able to obtain longer term contracts and higher day rates than older and less capable commodity rigs. In mid 2008, when the global economy began slipping into recession and access to capital diminished significantly due to weakening financial markets, both oil and natural gas prices began to decline precipitously, and were down from their highs by approximately 79% and 61%, respectively, by the end of 2008. Most companies reduced spending in 2009, and energy companies in particular, with the prospect of significantly reduced cash flows and constrained capital resources, dramatically cut exploration and development expenditures, with most of the reductions targeted at shallow water and land drilling. As access to capital began to be restored and global economies began to stabilize in 2009, oil prices more than doubled from their lows and global drilling activity appeared to bottom during the second quarter. Most drilling budgets in 2010 show increases over the reduced 2009 levels. Natural gas prices remained weak for most of 2009, causing a collapse in domestic land and offshore drilling markets early in the year, particularly in the Gulf of Mexico, though prices began strengthening and activity had begun to recover by years end. See further discussion under Drilling Operations Outlook. 23 Table of Contents Our Rig Fleets Our offshore fleet currently consists of 23 jack up rigs, featuring: Two 240C class jack ups, one of which was delivered in late 2008 and one in late 2009, Four Tarzan Class jack ups delivered during the 2004 2008 period, Four Super Gorilla class jack ups delivered during the 1998 2003 period, Three Gorilla class jack ups built during the early 1980s, Seven 116C class jack ups built during the early 1980s, and Two 84 class jack ups and one 116 class jack up built during the mid to late 1970s. The 240Cs, Tarzan Class, Super Gorillas and one of the Gorilla class rigs have at least two million pounds of hook load capability, enabling efficient drilling beyond 30,000 feet. We consider such rigs high specification jack ups. Five additional high specification jack ups are under construction with deliveries currently expected over the period from the second quarter of 2010 through the first quarter of 2012, including one 240C class rig and four EXL class rigs. See further discussion of our offshore newbuild program under Liquidity and Capital Resources Capital Expenditures. During 2009, we discontinued active marketing of three of our thirty two land rigs. Our land fleet currently consists of 29 marketed rigs, including 16 rigs constructed since 2005, four rigs built during 2001 2002 and nine older rigs that have been refurbished over the years. Current Operations The U.S. Gulf of Mexico offshore drilling market is highly fragmented among several oil and gas companies, many of which are independent operators whose drilling activities are highly dependent on near term operating cash flows. A typical drilling assignment may call for 60 days of exploration or development work performed under a single well contract with negotiable renewal options. Long term contracts have been relatively rare, and generally are available only from the major integrated oil companies and a few of the larger independent operators. Drilling activity and day rates in the Gulf of Mexico have tended to fluctuate rather quickly, and generally follow trends in natural gas prices. Offshore drilling demand in the Gulf reached a peak in 2007, began weakening in late 2008, and generally has remained weak since that time. We currently have eight rigs in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico seven under contracts expiring in 2010 and one that is idle. International markets present more opportunities for longer term drilling contracts and high specification rigs than do domestic markets. The relocation of rigs from domestic to foreign markets is a significant undertaking, and often interrupts revenues and cash flows for up to three to four months, particularly when equipment upgrades are involved. Thus, major relocations are typically carried out only when the likelihood of higher long term returns heavily outweighs the short term costs. The North Sea is a mature, harsh environment offshore drilling market that has long been dominated by major oil and gas companies operating within a relatively tight regulatory environment. Project lead times are often lengthy, and drilling assignments, which typically require ultra premium equipment capable of handling extreme weather conditions and high down hole pressures and temperatures, can range from several months to several years. Thus, drilling activity and day rates in the North Sea move slowly in response to market conditions, and generally follow trends in oil prices. We currently have two Super Gorilla class rigs operating in the North Sea one under contract that is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2011 and another under contract that is estimated to be completed in the third quarter of 2011. We have operated offshore eastern Canada at varying levels since the early 1980s, though we had vacated that market in late 2006. In July 2009, one of our Gorilla class rigs returned to eastern Canada, where it is operating under a contract that is expected to continue through the third quarter of 2010. The Middle East has been a primary focus among our international operations in recent years. In 2007, we added four rigs to our four existing rigs in the region two 116Cs with initial two year contracts with Maersk offshore Qatar, and two Tarzan Class rigs under four year contracts with Saudi Aramco. We added a third Tarzan Class rig in the Middle East under a three year contract in 2008 and currently have nine rigs in the region two under contracts expiring in 2010, four under contracts expiring in 2011 and three that are idle. 24 Table of Contents In October 2009, we completed mobilizing the J.P. Bussell to Egypt where it began operating for Shell under an approximate 20 month contract. Our two remaining rigs operating internationally are the Rowan Gorilla IV, which is operating for PEMEX in the Gulf of Mexico under a contract that is expected to conclude in the third quarter of 2011, and the Rowan Gorilla VII, which, after completion of the current contract in the second quarter of 2010, will mobilize from West Africa to the North Sea, where it has a contract that is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2012. 2009 Compared to 2008 The following table highlights the performance of our Drilling Services segment during 2009 compared to 2008 (dollars in millions, except day rates): 2009 2008 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 1,214.9 100 % $ 1,451.6 100 % Operating costs (525.2 ) 43 % (629.8 ) 43 % Depreciation expense (155.9 ) 13 % (125.9 ) 9 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (68.0 ) 6 % (69.2 ) 5 % Gains on property disposals 6.3 1 % 68.0 5 % Material charges and other operating expenses 0 % (24.6 ) 2 % Operating income $ 472.1 39 % $ 670.1 46 % Offshore fleet: Average day rate $ 175,100 $ 163,200 Rig utilization 73 % 95 % Revenue producing days 5,876 7,313 Land fleet: Average day rate $ 23,200 $ 22,600 Rig utilization 62 % 93 % Revenue producing days 7,175 10,067 The following table summarizes average prices for oil and natural gas and our utilization and average day rates by quarter in 2009, and for the full years 2009 and 2008 for our offshore fleet: Oil (per bbl) * Natural gas (per MCF) * Average utilization Average day rate 2009: First quarter $ 43.14 $ 4.47 93 % $ 173,600 Second quarter $ 59.61 $ 3.81 78 % $ 177,200 Third quarter $ 68.14 $ 3.44 59 % $ 182,500 Fourth quarter $ 76.00 $ 4.93 63 % $ 167,700 Full year: 2009 $ 61.95 $ 4.16 73 % $ 175,100 2008 $ 99.67 $ 8.90 95 % $ 163,200 * Source: New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) 25 Table of Contents The dramatic declines in oil and natural gas prices that began in mid 2008 coupled with the weakness in the global capital markets increased our customers efforts to preserve liquidity and adversely affected the economics of certain drilling projects. Most oil and gas producers significantly reduced their 2009 drilling expenditures, and that reduction was most prominent for shallow water and onshore projects. The reduction in demand reduced global jack up and land rig utilization, increased competition among available rigs for fewer drilling assignments, and pressured day rates. Drilling revenues for 2009 decreased by $236.7 million, or 16%, compared to 2008 as a result of the following (in millions): Increase (Decrease) Lower offshore rig utilization $ (274.7 ) Lower land rig utilization (86.3 ) Loss of the Rowan Anchorage1 (15.2 ) Reimbursables and other, net (10.8 ) Higher average land day rates 1.9 Addition of four land rigs2 23.3 Higher average offshore day rates 45.6 Addition of the J.P. Bussell and Rowan Mississippi3 79.5 Net decrease $ (236.7 ) 1The Rowan Anchorage was lost in September 2008 during Hurricane Ike. 2The four land rigs added to the fleet over the period from May 2008 through June 2009 contributed an additional 939 revenue producing days in 2009 as compared to 2008. 3The J.P. Bussell and Rowan Mississippi commenced operations in November 2008 and contributed 548 revenue producing days in 2009, as compared to 86 days in 2008. 26 Table of Contents The following table presents certain key performance measures by geographic area for our offshore fleet for 2009 and 2008. The number of rigs in each location is based on location for the majority of the period and includes active and idle rigs. Revenues include those attributable to reimbursable costs. Average day rates are computed by dividing revenues recognized during the year, excluding reimbursables, by the number of revenue producing days. Rig utilization is computed as the number of revenue producing days divided by total available rig days. 2009 2008 Gulf of Mexico: Number of rigs 8 8 Revenues $ 297,206,000 $ 402,696,000 Average day rate $ 145,600 $ 129,900 Utilization 64 % 97 % Middle East: Number of rigs 9 9 Revenues $ 373,059,000 $ 480,981,000 Average day rate $ 153,300 $ 155,400 Utilization 74 % 94 % North Sea: Number of rigs 2 2 Revenues $ 172,610,000 $ 166,486,000 Average day rate $ 243,400 $ 244,900 Utilization 97 % 91 % Other international: Number of rigs 3 2 Revenues $ 199,449,000 $ 158,988,000 Average day rate $ 257,600 $ 301,200 Utilization 83 % 98 % Drilling operating costs in 2009 decreased by $104.6 million, or 17% from 2008, as set forth in the table below (in millions): Increase (Decrease) % Change Personnel and related costs for existing rigs $ (55.3 ) 16 % Repairs and maintenance for existing rigs (27.5 ) 21 % Reimbursable expenses (9.8 ) 34 % Rig insurance costs for existing rigs (3.1 ) 7 % All other (8.9 ) 11 % Net decrease $ (104.6 ) 17 % The declines in personnel and related costs and repairs and maintenance expenses were primarily the result of reduced activity levels. Additionally, several shipyard upgrade projects on many of our idle rigs absorbed certain personnel related costs and resulted in lower routine repair and maintenance expenses that we would have otherwise incurred. Operating margins before depreciation and selling, general and administrative expenses were 57% in both 2009 and 2008. Drilling depreciation expense increased by $30.0 million or 24% between periods due primarily to the addition of the J.P. Bussell and Rowan Mississippi in November 2008. 27 Table of Contents 2008 Compared to 2007 The following table highlights the performance of our Drilling Services segment during 2008 compared to 2007 (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 1,451.6 100 % $ 1,382.6 100 % Operating costs (629.8 ) 43 % (591.4 ) 43 % Depreciation expense (125.9 ) 9 % (101.8 ) 7 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (69.2 ) 5 % (68.3 ) 5 % Gains on property disposals 68.0 5 % 40.7 3 % Material charges and other operating expenses (24.6 ) 2 % 0 % Operating income $ 670.1 46 % $ 661.8 48 % Drilling revenues increased by $69.0 million or 5% in 2008, due primarily to the effects of increased drilling activity and average day rates, as follows (in millions): Increase (Decrease) New rigs $ 33.2 Increases in average day rates 23.7 Net increase in utilization for existing rigs 16.6 Net increase in utilization for relocated rigs 12.5 Lost or sold rigs (9.4 ) Other, primarily reduction in reimbursables (7.6 ) Net increase $ 69.0 Our overall offshore fleet utilization was 95% in 2008, up from 94% in 2007, with most of the downtime in each period associated with rigs being prepared for long term assignments overseas. Our average offshore day rate was $163,200 in 2008, an increase of approximately 4% over 2007. Total revenue producing days offshore increased by 103 or 1% between years, with most of that increase associated with our new rigs. Middle East. Our nine jack ups working offshore Saudi Arabia and Qatar collectively generated approximately $480 million of drilling revenues in 2008, averaging more than $155,000 per day, compared to almost $400 million from eight rigs averaging $149,000 per day in 2007. Our utilization averaged 94% in 2008, up from 92% in 2007. North Sea. Our two rigs working in the North Sea generated approximately $164 million of drilling revenues in 2008, averaging about $245,000 per day, compared to $246 million from three rigs averaging $241,000 per day in 2007. Our utilization averaged 91% in 2008, down from 96% in 2007, with most of the downtime in 2008 due to rigs undergoing shipyard upgrades. Other International. After relocating from the North Sea in early January 2008, Gorilla VII was 96% utilized offshore West Africa and provided almost $325,000 per day in drilling revenues during the remainder of the year. Gorilla III was 100% utilized offshore Trinidad during the first five months of 2008, generating approximately $40 million of drilling revenues during the period, or more than $249,000 per day. Gorilla III relocated to the Gulf of Mexico during the second quarter of 2008 where the rig was 98% utilized during the remainder of the year. 28 Table of Contents Gulf of Mexico. The following table summarizes average oil and natural gas prices and our Gulf of Mexico fleet utilization and average day rates by quarter in 2008, and for the full years 2008 and 2007: Oil (per bbl) * Natural gas (MCF) * Average utilization Average day rate 2008: First quarter $ 97.86 $ 8.74 91 % $ 114,100 Second quarter $ 123.78 $ 11.47 98 % $ 126,600 Third quarter $ 118.29 $ 8.98 100 % $ 131,400 Fourth quarter $ 58.68 $ 6.40 100 % $ 144,600 Full year: 2008 $ 99.67 $ 8.90 97 % $ 129,900 2007 $ 72.34 $ 7.12 96 % $ 129,300 * Source: New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) Natural gas prices remained at historically high levels over the first half of 2008, and our fleet achieved stable utilization and increasing average day rates during that period, though shipyard time for upgrades to the Bob Palmer reduced average utilization during the first quarter. As prices weakened dramatically over the last half of the year, our contracted backlog helped to insulate Rowan from the effects of reduced drilling demand that ensued in the Gulf of Mexico and throughout the United States. The addition of the Rowan Mississippi and J.P. Bussell in November 2008, coupled with the loss of our oldest jack up, the Rowan Anchorage, during Hurricane Ike in September, increased our average rate during the fourth quarter. As shown in the preceding table, our average Gulf of Mexico day rate increased by $1,100 or 1% during 2008, though, by year end, we had begun to feel the impact of weakening demand for our three skid off rigs. Our total revenue producing days in the Gulf of Mexico decreased by 97 or 3% in 2008, due primarily to the effects of rig relocations. Land. Contracted backlog also enabled our 30 deep well land rigs in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma and Alaska to withstand the volatile domestic market conditions during 2008, and attain 93% utilization and an average day rate of $22,600 during the year, compared to 95% and $22,800 in 2007. The fleet included four new 2000 horsepower rigs that were delivered during 2008, which contributed to a 701 or 7% increase in revenue producing days during the year. Operating Costs. Drilling operating costs increased by $38.4 million or 6% in 2008 compared to 2007, due primarily to effects of the following (in millions): Increase (Decrease) % Change Personnel and related costs for existing rigs $ 19.8 7 % Repairs and maintenance for existing rigs 19.3 18 % Rig insurance costs for existing rigs (11.7 ) 21 % Addition of Rowan Mississippi and J.P. Bussell and four land rigs 11.2 All other (0.2 ) Net increase $ 38.4 6 % Depreciation expense incurred by our drilling operations increased by $24.1 million or 24% in 2008, due primarily to the addition of the rigs noted above. Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $0.9 million or 1% in 2008, due primarily to higher professional service fees resulting from our international expansion and incremental incentive compensation costs associated with our improved financial results. Our drilling operations realized $68.0 million of gains on asset disposals during 2008, including $37.1 million from insurance proceeds received in connection with the loss of the Rowan Anchorage during Hurricane Ike, $14.5 million from the sale of our London office, $5.4 million from the sale of our Fourchon, Louisiana, yard and $4.7 million from the sale of a land rig. Our 2007 net gain was $40.7 million, and included $14.1 million from the sale of our Alaska based drilling camps and $23.4 million related to the installment sale of the Rowan Midland and related equipment. 29 Table of Contents Our 2008 Drilling Services operating income included $24.6 million of special charges, including $11.8 million for the estimated unrecoverable cost of amounts expended on construction of our fourth 240C rig which we cancelled, $8.5 million related to severance costs, including the impact of accelerated equity awards primarily resulting from our CEOs 2008 retirement, $2.8 million of primarily professional service fees incurred in connection with the suspended LeTourneau monetization process, and $1.5 million related to the impairment of goodwill. Outlook Worldwide rig demand is inherently volatile and has historically varied from one geographic market to the next, as has the supply of competitive equipment. Exploration and development expenditures can be impacted by many local factors, such as political and regulatory policies, seasonal weather patterns, lease expirations, new oil and gas discoveries and reservoir depletion. Over time, the level and expected direction of oil and natural gas prices are the principal determinants of drilling activity, and oil and gas prices are ultimately a function of the supply of and demand for those commodities. Our backlog of drilling contracts as of February 16, 2010, was approximately $1.3 billion, which we estimate will be realized as follows: 2010 $905 million, 2011 $335 million, 2012 and later years $70 million. About 58% of our remaining available offshore rig days in 2010, and 17% of available days in 2011 are currently under contract, and most of our drilling contracts have termination penalties. Though we have had several notable additions to our drilling backlog over the past year, the total is down by approximately one quarter over this period. Certain of our customers have sought to modify existing contracts, and we have accepted modifications in the few cases where we felt it in our best long term interest to do so. We intend to enforce our drilling contracts and will vigorously defend our rights thereunder. Any such disputes may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows to the extent that collections are delayed and administrative costs are increased. As of February 16, 2010, ten of our offshore rigs had drilling contracts estimated to complete in 2010, eight had contracts estimated to complete in 2011, one had a contract estimated to complete in 2012 and four were available. We received delivery of the newly constructed Ralph Coffman in December 2009, and the rig commenced operations in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico in January 2010. Among the five rigs currently under construction and expected to be delivered over the period from early 2010 through early 2012, we have a contract from a customer for the use of one rig, and the remaining four are not yet contracted. Hurricanes (or windstorms) have caused tremendous damage to drilling and production equipment and facilities throughout the Gulf Coast in recent years, and insurance companies have incurred substantial losses as a result. Accordingly, insurance companies have substantially reduced the levels of windstorm coverage available and have dramatically increased the cost of such coverage. Coverage for potential liabilities to third parties associated with property damage and personal injuries, as well as coverage for environmental liabilities and removal of wreckage and debris associated with hurricane losses has also been limited. Rowan suffered a significant loss of prospective revenues and has incurred significant claims for removal of wreckage from the total destruction of six rigs in four separate storms from 2002 through 2008. Due to the increased cost and reduced availability of coverage as discussed above, in 2009 we decided to discontinue windstorm physical damage coverage on four of our older, lower specification jack up rigs, and our coverage for removal of wreckage is subject to a $100 million per occurrence deductible. Our windstorm physical damage coverage is subject to a $50 million per occurrence deductible with an annual aggregate limit of $150 million and covers only the Gorilla II, the Bob Palmer and the Rowan Mississippi. In each of the past several years, the onset of hurricane season has coincided with declines in drilling activity in the Gulf of Mexico. We expect this pattern to continue in future years. Our drilling operations are currently benefiting from contracted backlog obtained during the predominantly favorable market conditions of the past few years. As our rigs rolled off existing contracts throughout 2009, opportunities for new contracts were limited, and some of our rigs became and remain idle. Such opportunities have become more prevalent in recent months, though most encounter interest from many competing contractors and rigs. We believe there are currently 61 jack ups under construction for completion by 2012, most of which do not have drilling contracts in place. Delivery of those rigs is expected to further increase competition among jack up contractors. Thus, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to replace our contract backlog as it is realized, that we can maintain current utilization levels, that spot day rates will remain above breakeven levels, or that our drilling operations will remain profitable. 30 Table of Contents Manufacturing Operations We have manufacturing facilities in Longview and Houston, Texas, and Vicksburg, Mississippi, which collectively produce drilling rigs and various rig components and mining and forestry equipment, alloy steel and steel plate under two operating segments Drilling Products and Systems and Mining, Forestry and Steel Products. The Drilling Products and Systems segment provides equipment, parts and services for the offshore and onshore oil and gas drilling industry. Featured products include complete jack up rigs, rig kits and component packages, primary drilling equipment such as mud pumps, drawworks, top drives and rotary tables, and electrical components such as variable speed motors and drives. The segment built the first offshore jack up drilling rig in 1955 and has since designed, built or licensed the construction of more than 200 rigs, including all 23 in our fleet. During 2008, Drilling Products and Systems completed construction of our fourth Tarzan Class rig, the J.P. Bussell, and our first 240C class rig, the Rowan Mississippi, and in December 2009, completed construction of the second 240C class rig, the Ralph Coffman. The Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment produces large wheeled mining and timber equipment and related parts and carbon and alloy steel and steel plate. Our manufacturing revenues are greatly influenced by the timing of product shipments, and our profitability is impacted by the mix of product sales. Original equipment sales, for example, have traditionally yielded lower margins than the related after market parts sales. Land rigs and component packages typically require more costs for commissioning than do individual pumps and other drilling equipment, and often carry a package discount. Thus, our gross margins are typically higher on equipment sales than on rigs and component packages. 2009 Compared to 2008 The following table highlights the performance of our Drilling Products and Systems segment for 2009 and 2008 (dollars in millions): 2009 2008 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 369.4 100 % $ 493.5 100 % Operating costs (341.0 ) 92 % (421.5 ) 85 % Depreciation expense (9.0 ) 2 % (9.5 ) 2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (16.0 ) 4 % (25.1 ) 5 % Material charges and other operating expenses 0 % (81.9 ) 17 % Net gain (loss) on property disposals 0 % (0.1 ) 0 % Operating income (loss) $ 3.4 1 % $ (44.6 ) 9 % Revenues from Drilling Products and Systems decreased by $124.1 million, or 25%, between periods due primarily to the following: A decrease of $78.0 million attributable to $111.6 million of revenues recognized on five offshore rig kit projects in 2009, as compared to $189.6 million recognized on eight projects in 2008; A decrease of $36.3 million attributable to $103.0 million recognized on shipments of land rigs and component packages in 2009, down from $139.3 million in 2008; A decrease of $23.8 million attributable to $1.9 million of revenues recognized on shipments of top drives in 2009, down from $25.7 million in 2008; An increase of $8.6 million attributable to $50.1 million recognized on 57 mud pumps shipped in 2009, up from $41.5 million on 63 pumps in 2008. Our average margin before depreciation and selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 8% of revenues in 2009 from 15% in 2008. Margins in 2009 were negatively affected by sales mix, with a greater share of revenues from some of our lower margin products as compared to the prior year and poor results on several land rig projects. 31 Table of Contents Selling, general and administrative costs declined by $9.1 million or 36% between periods due primarily to lower compensation and related fringe benefit costs associated with reduced employment levels. Our Drilling Products and Systems operating results for 2009 exclude $278.9 million of revenues and $182.3 million of expenses in connection with sales of products and services to our Drilling Services segment, much of which was attributable to construction of the newbuild jack up, Ralph Coffman, and kits and equipment provided for our EXL rigs. Drilling Products and Systems operating results for 2008 excludes $382.9 million of revenues and $307.7 million of expenses, primarily for construction of the J.P. Bussell, Rowan Mississippi and Ralph Coffman. The following table highlights the performance of our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment for 2009 and 2008 (dollars in millions): 2009 2008 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 185.9 100 % $ 267.6 100 % Operating costs (134.6 ) 72 % (203.3 ) 76 % Depreciation expense (6.5 ) 3 % (6.1 ) 2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (18.8 ) 10 % (20.8 ) 8 % Material charges and other operating expenses 0 % (4.7 ) 2 % Net loss on property disposals (0.5 ) 0 % (0.1 ) 0 % Operating income $ 25.5 14 % $ 32.6 12 % Revenues from Mining, Forestry and Steel Products decreased by $81.7 million or 31% between periods due primarily to the following: Lower sales of new mining loaders and forestry stackers, which declined by $38.9 million or 38%, from $102.6 million in 2008 to $63.7 million in 2009. We shipped 14 new mining loaders and forestry stackers 2009, as compared to 29 units in 2008; Lower sales of steel plate, which declined by $35.0 million or 52%, from $66.9 million in 2008 to $31.9 million in 2009; A two percent increase in part sales, to $73.3 million in 2009 from $71.9 million in 2008. Our average margin before depreciation and selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 28% of revenues in 2009 from 24% in 2008. The higher margins were attributable to primarily product sales mix, particularly a greater proportion of higher margin after market parts and service revenues in 2009. 2008 Compared to 2007 The following table highlights the performance of our Drilling Products and Systems segment during 2008 compared to 2007 (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 493.5 100 % $ 498.6 100 % Operating costs (421.5 ) 85 % (426.6 ) 86 % Depreciation expense (9.5 ) 2 % (11.7 ) 2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (25.1 ) 5 % (17.2 ) 3 % Material charges and other operating expenses (81.9 ) 17 % 0 % Losses on property disposals (0.1 ) 0 % (0.1 ) 0 % Operating income $ (44.6 ) 9 % $ 43.0 9 % 32 Table of Contents Our Drilling Products and Systems segment sustained a $5.1 million or 1% decrease in revenues in 2008, which featured the following: $175.4 million associated with 16 land rigs and component packages shipped in 2008, up from $148.3 million in 2007; $153.5 million recognized on eight rig kit projects in 2008, up from $116.9 million in 2007; $41.5 million from 63 mud pumps shipped in 2008, down from $49.8 million and 70 pumps in 2007; $14.9 million related to drive and control system packages, down from $33.4 million in 2007; $12.9 million from 216 motors shipped in 2008, down from $15.2 million in 2007; and $7.7 million from custom fabrication work, down from $27.9 million in 2007. Our 2007 operating results included $41.6 million of revenues and a $15.8 million loss on the external rig construction project which required many more labor hours than we originally anticipated. There were no such revenues in 2008. Thus, as is shown in the preceding table, our average margin over operating costs increased slightly to 15% of revenues in 2008 from 14% in 2007. Depreciation expense incurred by Drilling Products and Systems in 2008 decreased by $2.2 million or 19% over 2007, due primarily to incremental depreciation related to a land rig lease transaction during 2007. Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $7.9 million or 46% in 2008, due primarily to higher expenses related to our sales and marketing efforts. Drilling Products and Systems operating results for 2008 included material charges and other operating expenses of $81.9 million, which included a $62.4 million charge for estimated surplus inventory, $10.9 million for goodwill impairment, $6.4 million of allocated monetization costs and $2.2 million for severance costs incurred in connection with headcount reductions. Operating results for 2008 shown in the preceding table exclude the effects of the approximately $383 million of revenues and $308 million of expenses in connection with products and services provided to our Drilling Services segment during the year, most of which was attributable to construction progress on the Rowan Mississippi, the J.P. Bussell and the Ralph Coffman. The following table highlights the performance of our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment during 2008 compared to 2007 (dollars in millions): 2008 2007 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 267.6 100 % $ 213.8 100 % Operating costs (203.3 ) 76 % (169.9 ) 79 % Depreciation expense (6.1 ) 2 % (5.3 ) 2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (20.8 ) 8 % (9.4 ) 4 % Material charges and other operating expenses (4.7 ) 2 % 0 % Losses on property disposals and other (0.1 ) 0 % (0.1 ) 0 % Operating income $ 32.6 12 % $ 29.1 14 % Our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment achieved an aggregate $53.8 million or 25% increase in revenues in 2008, which featured the following: $107.9 million of equipment revenues in 2008, up from $94.9 million in 2007; shipments of mining loaders and forestry stackers totaled 29 units in 2008, down from 30 units in 2007, though 16 of the 2008 units were the larger L 1850 model which carry a higher selling price, up from 13 larger units in 2007; $71.9 million from parts sales in 2008, up from $62.6 million in 2007; $66.9 million from steel plate revenues in 2008, up from $41.2 million in 2007; shipments totaled 61,900 tons in 2008, up by 9,000 tons or 17% over 2007, and the mix changed from 51% external in 2007 to 59% external in 2008, yielding a 33% increase in external volume between years. Thus, as is shown in the preceding table, our average margin on operating costs increased to 24% of revenues in 2008 from 21% in 2007. 33 Table of Contents Depreciation expense incurred by Mining, Forestry and Steel Products in 2008 increased by $.8 million or 15% from 2007, due to machinery and equipment additions made in the previous year to increase our manufacturing capacity. Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $11.4 million or 121% in 2008, due primarily to higher expenses related to our sales and marketing efforts and increased amounts of professional fees and other shared administrative costs that are allocated between our manufacturing segments based upon revenues. Mining, Forestry and Steel Products operating results for 2008 included charges and other operating expenses of $4.7 million, which included $3.5 million of allocated monetization costs and $1.2 million for goodwill impairment. Outlook Our manufacturing operations are highly impacted by world commodities prices. Our Drilling Products and Systems segment is closely tied to the condition of the overall drilling industry and demand for drilling equipment, parts and services. The prospects for our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment are strongly affected by prices for copper, iron ore, coal and timber. The volatility of commodity prices and weakness in global capital markets over the latter half of 2008 and much of 2009 resulted in reduced demand for most of the manufactured products and services that we offer, though prices and demand, particularly for mined commodities, began improving in late 2009. We cannot predict the duration of the current operating environment or quantify the impact that current business conditions will have on our future operations. Our external manufacturing backlog, which consists of executed contracts and customer commitments, was approximately $413 million at December 31, 2009, compared to $562 million at December 31, 2008, and included $217 million related to offshore rig projects, $71 million related to land rig projects, $67 million of mining and forestry equipment, $29 million of drilling equipment and $29 million primarily for parts and other components. We expect that about 95% of our external backlog at December 31, 2009, will be realized as revenue in 2010 and the balance in 2011 and 2012. We can provide no assurance we will be able to maintain or significantly increase our backlog going forward. Facing reduced liquidity, certain of our customers sought to modify existing orders by delaying deliveries and related payments. Others attempted to reduce or cancel orders altogether. Though we fully intend to enforce our contractual rights, such actions by our customers could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows to the extent that collections are delayed, administrative costs are increased, and we are otherwise unable to fully recover the in process cost attributable to such orders. We estimate that approximately $15 million or less than 4% of our December 31, 2009, manufacturing backlog is at risk of being delayed or canceled. Should market conditions worsen, these actions may intensify, though we cannot assess that likelihood or the resulting impact on our results of operations or cash flows. We currently have no further plans for rig construction at our Vicksburg shipyard following the delivery of our third 240C class rig, the Joe Douglas, in 2011. Absent additional orders or sufficient prospects for future work, the activities at the facility would be significantly reduced at that time, in which case we would incur additional costs such as employee severance, among other charges. Closing or significantly reducing activity levels at the facility could result in the incurrence of cash charges ranging from $5 million to $6 million and noncash charges ranging from $7 million to $10 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Key balance sheet amounts and ratios for 2009 and 2008 were as follows (dollars in millions): December 31, December 31, 2009 2008 Cash and cash equivalents $ 639.7 $ 222.4 Current assets $ 1,549.8 $ 1,369.2 Current liabilities $ 568.3 $ 744.6 Current ratio 2.73 1.84 Current maturities of long term debt $ 64.9 $ 64.9 Long term debt, less current maturities $ 787.5 $ 355.6 Stockholders equity $ 3,110.4 $ 2,659.8 Long term debt/total capitalization 0.20 0.12 34 Table of Contents Reflected in the comparison above are the effects of the following sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents in 2009, with comparable amounts for 2008: 2009 2008 Net operating cash flows $ 544.1 $ 694.5 Borrowings, net of issue costs 491.7 80.0 Proceeds from asset disposals 8.6 97.6 Proceeds from equity compensation and debenture plans and other 1.5 33.8 Capital expenditures (566.4 ) (829.1 ) Debt repayments (64.9 ) (144.9 ) Cash dividend payments (45.0 ) Net change in restricted cash balance 50.0 All other, net 2.7 1.1 Total sources (uses) $ 417.3 $ (62.0 ) Operating Cash Flows Operating cash flows approximated $544.1 million for 2009 as compared to $694.5 million for 2008. Our cash flows from operations have benefited and will continue to benefit from long term drilling contracts entered into when rates were significantly higher than current market rates. Several of our offshore rigs are operating under contracts at above market rates negotiated in periods of stronger demand. As a result, operating cash flows may be negatively affected in the future as these higher day rate contracts are completed. Capital Expenditures Capital expenditures in 2009 totaled $566 million and included: $261 million towards construction of the four EXL class rigs; $99 million towards construction of our second and third 240C class rigs, the Ralph Coffman and Joe Douglas; $164 million for improvements to the existing offshore fleet; $8 million for our land rig fleet, including $5 million towards construction of two new land rigs. The remaining $34 million included the cost of drill pipe, improvements to our rig service and repair facility at Sabine Pass and other enhancements. Reference should be made to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K for a detailed status of our newbuild projects. Our 2010 capital budget, as approved by our Board of Directors, is approximately $501 million, and includes $107 million toward construction of the 240C class rig, Joe Douglas, $229 million toward construction of the four EXL class rigs and $119 million for upgrades to existing rigs. Over the past few years, as a result of our fleet expansion program, our cash flows from operations have not been sufficient to cover our capital expenditures and debt service requirements. As noted under Long term Debt below, in July 2009, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7.875% Senior Notes due August 2019 (the Senior Notes), and received net proceeds of $492 million. Despite the current weak operating environment, we anticipate that our cash flows from operations will continue to cover a significant amount of our capital expenditures, debt service, and other cash requirements over the next twelve months, and cash flows from operations plus available cash balances will be sufficient to meet such requirements over this period. We will periodically review and adjust the capital budget as necessary based upon current and forecasted cash flows and liquidity, anticipated market conditions in our drilling and manufacturing businesses, the availability of financing sources, and alternative uses of capital to enhance shareholder value. Certain such adjustments would require Board approval. 35 Table of Contents Long term Debt On July 21, 2009, the Company completed the issuance and sale of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 7.875% Senior Notes. Net proceeds to the Company, after underwriting discount and offering expenses, were $492 million. The Company intends to use the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable in semi annual installments of $19.7 million on February 1 and August 1 of each year, commencing in 2010. No principal payments are required prior to maturity. The Company may, at its option, redeem all or part of the Senior Notes at any time at a make whole price. The Senior Notes are general unsecured, senior obligations that rank (a) pari passu in right of payment with any of the Companys existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not by its terms subordinated to the Senior Notes, including any indebtedness under the Companys senior revolving credit facility (other than letter of credit reimbursement obligations that are secured by cash deposits), (b) effectively junior to the Companys existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness under its secured notes issued pursuant to the MARAD Title XI program to finance several offshore drilling rigs), in each case, to the extent of the value of the Companys assets constituting collateral securing that indebtedness and (c) effectively junior to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Companys subsidiaries (other than indebtedness and liabilities owed to the Company). In August 2009, we fixed the interest rate for the remaining term on the $65.7 million of outstanding MARAD debt collateralized by the offshore rig, Bob Keller, at an annual rate of 3.525%. Prior to that time, the rate floated based on a short term commercial paper rate plus 0.15%. In November 2009, we fixed the interest rate for the remaining term on the $124.9 million of outstanding MARAD debt collateralized by the offshore rig, Bob Palmer, at an annual rate of 3.158%. Prior to that time, the rate floated based on a short term commercial paper rate plus 0.25%. Rowans first two Tarzan Class jack up rigs and each of our four Super Gorilla class rigs were substantially financed through long term bank loans guaranteed by the U.S. Department of Transportations Maritime Administration (MARAD). Under the MARAD Title XI program, we obtained financing as a reimbursement for qualifying expenditures up to a pre approved limit and based upon actual construction progress. Each note requires semi annual payments of principal and interest and is secured by a preferred mortgage on the rig. The following table summarizes the status of each of our Title XI borrowings at December 31, 2009 (dollars in millions): Rig Delivery Borrowings Repayments Balance Interest rate (a) Principal repayment dates Principal repayment amounts Final maturity Gorilla V Dec 1998 $ 153.1 $ 140.4 $ 12.7 6.50 % Jan 1, July 1 $ 6.4 Jul 2010 Gorilla VI Jun 2000 171.0 135.4 35.6 5.88 % Mar 15, Sep 15 $ 7.1 Mar 2012 Gorilla VII Dec 2001 185.4 123.6 61.8 2.80 % Apr 20, Oct 20 $ 7.7 Oct 2013 Scooter Yeargain Apr 2004 91.2 33.4 57.8 4.33 % May 1, Nov 1 $ 3.0 May 2019 Bob Keller Aug 2005 89.7 26.9 62.8 3.53 % May 1, Nov 1 $ 3.0 May 2020 Bob Palmer Aug 2003 187.3 62.4 124.9 3.16 % Jan 15, July 15 $ 5.2 Jul 2021 Total $ 877.7 $ 522.1 $ 355.6 (a) Interest rates are as of December 31, 2009. The interest rate for the Gorilla V is a weighted average of two notes for that rig. Our debt agreements contain provisions that require minimum levels of working capital and stockholders equity and limit the amount of long term debt and, in the event of noncompliance, restrict investment activities, asset purchases and sales, lease obligations, borrowings and mergers or acquisitions. Our debt agreements also specify the minimum insurance coverage for our financed rigs. The extent of hurricane damage sustained throughout the Gulf Coast area in recent years has dramatically increased the cost and reduced the availability of insurance coverage for windstorm losses. As a result, we determined that windstorm coverage meeting the requirements of our existing debt agreements was cost prohibitive. At the Companys request, MARAD waived certain windstorm insurance coverage requirements under the loan agreements, for which the Company agreed to a covenant to maintain a minimum cash balance, which is currently $25 million. Rowan remains subject to restrictions on the use of certain insurance proceeds should the Company experience future windstorm losses. Each of these security provisions will be released by MARAD should Rowan be able to obtain windstorm coverage that satisfies the original terms of its debt agreements. 36 Table of Contents In June 2008, we entered into a three year $155 million revolving credit facility, which we intend to use, as necessary, for general corporate purposes. The underlying credit agreement limits new borrowings, requires minimum cash flows, provides that the facility will not be available in the event of a material adverse change in our condition, operations, business, assets, liabilities or ability to perform, and otherwise contains restrictions similar to those noted above. We had no borrowings outstanding under the credit facility at December 31, 2009. We believe that funding under the credit facility continues to be available, if necessary. We were in compliance with each of our debt covenants at December 31, 2009 and, based on current projections, we expect to be in compliance in 2010. We believe our most restrictive financial covenant is the requirement that our prior 12 month earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation be at least three times interest expense. At December 31, 2009, we exceeded that requirement by $579 million. Pension Obligations Minimum pension contributions are determined based upon actuarial calculations of pension assets and liabilities that involve, among other things, assumptions about long term asset returns and interest rates. Similar calculations were used to estimate pension costs and obligations as reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2009, our financial statements reflected an aggregate unfunded pension liability of $195 million, most of which relates to our drilling employees plan. In order to slow the rate at which plan benefits were growing, we amended the benefit formula for new drilling plan entrants effective January 1, 2008, and further amended the plan for remaining active participants effective July 1, 2009. The plan changes that became effective in 2009 resulted in an approximately $15 million annualized reduction in pension expense. Despite the changes to the drilling plan, we will need to make significant pension contributions over the next several years, and additional funding would be required if asset values decline. We currently expect to make minimum pension contributions of approximately $57 million in 2010. Cash Dividends In May 2006, our Board of Directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per common share, which we paid approximately every three months thereafter through November 2008. In January 2009, in light of prevailing business conditions, our Board of Directors decided to discontinue the payment of dividends, and no dividends have been paid since that time. Future dividends, if any, will only be paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors. At December 31, 2009, we had approximately $615 million of retained earnings available for distribution to stockholders under provisions of our debt agreements. We do not expect to pay dividends in the foreseeable future. Proceeds from Asset Disposals In 2008, we sold our London office building for $17.6 million and a land rig for $10.8 million, and recognized gains of $14.5 million and $4.7 million, respectively. In 2008 we also received approximately $16.5 million in cash and recognized a $5.4 million gain in connection with the sale of our Fourchon, Louisiana service facility. In 2008, we lost the jack up rig Rowan Anchorage during Hurricane Ike. The rig was insured for $60 million and subject to a $17.5 million deductible. In 2008, we received the full $42.5 million of insurance proceeds and recognized a $37.1 million gain. In 2005, we sold our semi submersible rig, the Rowan Midland, for approximately $60 million in cash, which was received over a 15 month period ending in January 2007, at which time title to the rig was transferred to the buyer. We retained ownership of much of the drilling equipment on the rig through 2006 and 2007 and continued to provide a number of operating personnel under a separate services agreement through February 2007. The transaction was accounted for as a sales type lease with the expected gain on sale and imputed interest income of approximately $46 million deferred until the net book value of the rig had been recovered. During 2007, we received remaining payments totaling $23.4 million and recognized such amount as additional gain on the sale. Another $14.1 million of gain was realized in 2007 on the June sale of our Alaska drilling camps. 37 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2009 (dollars in millions): Payments due by period Total Within 1 year 2 to 3 years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Long term debt obligations, including interest $ 1,312 $ 117 $ 195 $ 152 $ 848 Purchase obligations, including capital expenditures 1,254 761 493 Operating leases 17 6 5 2 4 Total $ 2,583 $ 884 $ 693 $ 154 $ 852 We periodically employ letters of credit or other bank issued guarantees in the normal course of our businesses, and had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $42.0 million at December 31, 2009. Based on current and anticipated near term operating levels, we believe that operating cash flows together with existing working capital and our currently available borrowing capacity will be adequate to sustain planned capital expenditures and debt service and other requirements at least through the remainder of 2010. Contingent Liabilities Reference should be made to Note 6 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a discussion of the status of significant legal proceedings. Critical Accounting Policies and Management Estimates Rowans significant accounting policies are presented in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. These policies, and management judgments, assumptions and estimates made in their application underlie reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that our most critical accounting policies and management estimates involve revenue recognition (primarily upfront service fees for equipment moves and modifications and longer term manufacturing projects), inventory (primarily valuation allowances for excess and obsolete inventories), property and depreciation (particularly capitalizable costs, useful lives and salvage values), carrying values of long lived assets, pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs (specifically assumptions used in actuarial calculations), and income taxes (particularly our estimated reserves for uncertain tax positions), as changes in such policies and or estimates would produce significantly different amounts from those reported herein. Revenue recognition Our drilling contracts generally provide for payment on a day rate basis, and revenues are recognized as the work progresses with the passage of time. We frequently receive lump sum payments at the outset of a drilling assignment as upfront service fees for equipment moves or modifications, and such payments (and related costs) are recognized as drilling revenues (and expenses) over the contract period. At December 31, 2009, we had deferred $38.4 million of revenues and $27.5 million of costs related to such upfront service fees, with such amounts primarily related to mobilization and modification activities in connection with our foreign drilling contracts. We also recognize revenue for certain reimbursable costs. Each reimbursable item and amount is stipulated in our drilling contract with the customer, and such items and amounts frequently vary between contracts. We have recognized reimbursable costs on the gross basis, as both revenues and expenses, because we are the primary obligor in the arrangement, we have discretion in supplier selection, we are involved in determining product or service specifications and we assume full credit risk related to the reimbursable costs. We generally recognize manufacturing sales and related costs when title passes as products are shipped. Revenues from longer term contracts such as for the construction of offshore rigs and rig kits are recognized on the percentage of completion basis using contract costs incurred relative to total estimated project costs. An offshore rig construction project typically occurs over a two year period at our Vicksburg, Mississippi, shipyard and includes a significant labor cost component for fabrication and assembly. A rig kit includes selected rig components and parts manufactured over a six to nine month period in our Longview, Texas, facility. Costs are recorded separately for each offshore rig or rig kit project, and by significant activity or component within each project, and include materials issued to the project, labor expenses that are incurred directly for the project and overhead expenses that are allocated across all projects at consistent rates per labor hour. 38 Table of Contents Incurred costs include only those that measure project work performed. Material costs incurred, for example, do not include materials purchased but remaining in inventory. Only when such materials have been used in production on the project are they included in incurred project costs. The determination of total estimated project costs is performed monthly based upon then current information. This process involves an evaluation of progress towards project milestones and an assessment of work left to complete each project activity or component, and is based on physical observations by project managers and engineers. An estimate of project costs is then developed for each significant activity or component based upon the assessment of project status, actual costs incurred to date and outstanding commitments for project materials and services. We do not recognize any estimated profit until such projects are at least 10% complete, though a full provision is made immediately for any anticipated losses. During 2007, we recognized a $15.8 million loss on our external rig construction project, bringing the total loss on the project to approximately $17.9 million. This was the first rig construction project for an external customer that we had performed in over a decade, and we have no further plans for additional external rig construction projects at this time. With respect to our rig kits, due to the smaller size and duration of the projects and lesser labor cost component, we have not experienced any significant fluctuations in the percentage of completion measurements, nor have we incurred any losses on such projects. In 2009 we recognized $101.4 million of manufacturing revenues and $69.5 million of costs related to rig kit projects on the percentage of completion basis. Inventory Inventory is carried at the lower of average cost or estimated net realizable value. Costs include labor, material and an allocation of production overhead. We determine valuation allowances or reserves for inventory based on historical usage of inventory on hand, assumptions about future demand based on market conditions, and estimates about potential alternative uses, which are usually limited. Our inventory generally consists of spare parts, work in process, and raw materials to support ongoing manufacturing operations and the Companys installed base of drilling, mining and timber equipment. Customers rely on us to stock these specialized items to ensure that their equipment can be repaired and serviced in a timely manner. The estimated carrying value of our inventory therefore ultimately depends upon demand driven by oil, natural gas and other commodity prices, general economic conditions worldwide and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell, among other factors. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, our inventory reserves totaled 8% and 13% of gross inventory, respectively. As a result of declines in oil and natural gas prices, the onset of global recession and weakness in capital markets in 2008, we reduced our estimates of the future usage of our drilling equipment inventories and significantly increased our inventory valuation reserves at December 31, 2008. Further deterioration in worldwide demand for oil, natural gas and certain other commodities, or the development of new technologies which make older drilling, mining and timber equipment technologies obsolete, could require us to record additional reserves to reduce the value of our inventory. Property and depreciation Expenditures for new property or enhancements to existing property are capitalized, and expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred. Capitalized cost includes labor expended during installation and, on newly constructed assets, a portion of interest cost incurred during the construction period. We provide depreciation under the straight line method from the date an asset is placed into service based upon estimated service lives ranging up to 40 years and salvage values ranging up to 20%. Thirteen of our twenty three jack up rigs were placed into service at various dates during the period from 1971 to 1986. Many of those rigs had met or far exceeded their assigned useful lives of 12 to 15 years by the time our Super Gorilla class rig, the Gorilla V, was delivered in 1998. The Super Gorilla class and the subsequent Tarzan Class and 240C class have been assigned 25 year useful lives. Each class of rig has been specifically designed to achieve greater drilling performance while encountering tougher well conditions and employs technological advances in load bearing capability, power distribution, and solids control designed to provide more efficient drilling to greater depths, helping to ensure continuing economic life to the Company. 39 Table of Contents Impairment of long lived assets We evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment, primarily our drilling rigs, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such rigs may not be recoverable. Generally, extended periods of idle time and or our inability to contract rigs at economical rates are an indication that a rig may be impaired. However, the offshore drilling industry has historically been highly cyclical and it is not unusual for rigs to be unutilized or underutilized for extended periods of time and subsequently resume full or near full utilization when business cycles change. Likewise, during periods of excess supply, rigs are frequently contracted at or near cash break even rates for extended periods. Impairment situations may arise with respect to specific individual rigs, groups of rigs, such as a specific type of drilling rig, or rigs in a certain geographic region. Our rigs are mobile and may generally be moved from regions with excess supply, if economically feasible. Asset impairment evaluations are, by nature, highly subjective. In most instances, they involve expectations of future cash flows to be generated by our drilling rigs and are based on managements judgments and assumptions regarding future industry conditions and operations, as well as managements estimates of future expected utilization, contract rates, expense levels and capital requirements of our drilling rigs. The estimates, judgments and assumptions used by management in the application of our asset impairment policies reflect both historical experience and an assessment of current operational, industry, market, economic and political environments. The use of different estimates, judgments, assumptions and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations would likely result in materially different carrying values of assets and operating results. Pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs Our pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs are based upon actuarial computations that reflect our assumptions about future events, including long term asset returns, interest rates, annual compensation increases, mortality rates and other factors. Key assumptions at December 31, 2009, included discount rates ranging from 5.83% to 5.97%, an expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets of 8% and annual healthcare cost increases ranging from 8.7% in 2010 to 4.5% in 2029 and beyond. The assumed discount rate is based upon the average yield for Moodys Aa rated corporate bonds and the rate of return assumption reflects a probability distribution of expected long term returns that is weighted based upon plan asset allocations. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase our recorded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities by approximately $90 million, while a one percentage point change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would change annual net benefits cost by approximately $3.5 million. A one percentage point increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would increase 2010 net other postretirement benefit cost by $0.6 million. Income taxes As discussed in Note 9 to the financial statements, in 2009 we recognized tax benefits of $25 million as a result of applying our facts to a recent third party tax case that provides a more favorable tax treatment for certain foreign contracts entered into in prior years. In accordance with accounting guidelines for income tax uncertainties, we evaluate a tax position to determine if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on its merits. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in income for the period, and a reserve, if any. Our income tax returns are subject to audit by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. Determinations by such taxing authorities that differ materially from our recorded estimates, either favorably or unfavorably, may have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We believe our reserve for uncertain tax positions totaling $55 million at December 31, 2009, is properly recorded in accordance with the accounting guidelines. New Accounting Standards In October 2009, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (ASU) No. 2009 13, Revenue Recognition (Topic 605), Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements, a consensus of the FASB Emerging Issues Task Force. ASU No. 2009 13 addresses accounting by vendors who provide multiple products or services to customers at different points in time or over different time periods. Specifically, ASU No. 2009 13 eliminates the residual method of allocating revenues to each activity and requires that revenue be allocated at inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using a relative selling price method. ASU No. 2009 13 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010 and may be applied prospectively for arrangements entered into after the effective date or retrospectively for all periods presented. The Company is currently studying what impact, if any, adoption may have on its financial statements. 40 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS Rowans outstanding debt at December 31, 2009, was comprised entirely of fixed rate debt with a carrying value of $852.4 million, bearing a weighted average annual interest rate of 6.2%. Due to the fixed rate nature of the Companys debt, management believes the risk of loss due to changes in market interest rates is not material. The majority of Rowans transactions are denominated in United States dollars. The Company has some exposure to currency exchange fluctuations primarily in Brazil and Australia as a result of its manufacturing presence in those countries. In order to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, Rowan generally requires customer payments to be in U.S. dollars and limits foreign currency holdings to the extent they are needed to pay liabilities denominated in such currencies. The Company recognized a net foreign currency gain of $5.4 million in 2009 and a loss of $10.8 million in 2008, primarily attributable to operations in Australia and Brazil. Fluctuating commodity prices affect Rowans future earnings materially to the extent that they influence demand for the Companys products and services. As a general practice, Rowan does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments.
