ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS SUMMARY Our 2010 drilling operating results benefited from offshore fleet additions and improved land activity levels, the effects of which substantially offset the impact of our concluding several peak day rate contracts during the year and lower utilization of our less capable rigs, resulting in a slight decline in drilling revenues from 2009. These factors, however, also caused an increase in operating expenses between periods, which reduced operating margins. We were successful throughout the year in both maintaining a high level of utilization for our higher specification rigs and in obtaining contractual commitments for our newly constructed high spec jack ups prior to delivery, as oil and gas companies have increasingly sought more capable equipment to meet ever more demanding drilling requirements. Our less capable rigs, on the other hand, have encountered much more competition for the relatively fewer available assignments, resulting in extended periods of idle time. This segmentation of demand based on rig capability has been an emerging trend over the past two years, and one that we believe will continue. All but one of our sixteen high spec jack ups were under drilling contracts or commitments at February 25, 2011, as were two of our three high spec rigs under construction, whereas only seven of our remaining twelve offshore rigs were contracted at that date. In September 2010, we completed the acquisition of Skeie Drilling & Production ASA SKDP, a Norwegian entity that owned and managed the construction of three high spec jack up rigs. The Rowan Viking was delivered in October 2010 and is scheduled to commence operations in late March 2011 under a 19 month assignment in the UK sector of the North Sea after completion of contractually required modifications. The Rowan Stavanger was delivered in January 2011 and is expected to commence operations in the second quarter of 2011 for up to 150 days of accommodation work in the Norwegian sector, followed by an approximately 10 month drilling commitment for four wells beginning in late 2011 for w ork in the UK and Norwegian sectors of the North Sea. The Rowan Norway is expected to be delivered in June 2011 and has a 240 day contract for work in the UK sector of the North Sea beginning in late 2011, plus a one year priced option. As of February 25, 2011, we had ten offshore rigs in the Middle East, ten in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, five in or en route to the North Sea, one each in Mexico, Trinidad and Egypt, and three under construction. At that date, fifteen of our offshore rigs had drilling contracts estimated to complete in 2011, three had contracts or commitments estimated to complete in 2012, one had a contract estimated to complete in 2013, three had contracts estimated to complete in 2014, and six were available. Additionally, at February 25, 2011, we had 30 land rigs located in Texas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Alabama and Alaska, 24 of which were under contract with estimated completion dates as follows: sixteen in 2011, six in 2012, and one each in 2014 and 2015. A key element of our strategy has been to separate our manufacturing and land drilling operations from our core offshore drilling business when market conditions were suitable. We believe conditions are suitable now and expect to begin a process in 2011 to sell or spin off these businesses. 23 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table highlights Rowans operating results by business segment (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Revenues: Drilling services $ 1,208.8 $ 1,214.9 $ 1,451.6 Manufacturing sales and services: Drilling products and systems 310.3 369.4 493.5 Mining, forestry and steel products 300.1 185.9 267.6 Total manufacturing sales and services 610.4 555.3 761.1 Total revenues $ 1,819.2 $ 1,770.2 $ 2,212.7 Costs and expenses: Drilling services $ 809.8 $ 742.8 $ 781.5 Manufacturing sales and services: Drilling products and systems 383.3 366.0 538.1 Mining, forestry and steel products 235.1 160.4 235.0 Total manufacturing sales and services 618.4 526.4 773.1 Total costs and expenses $ 1,428.2 $ 1,269.2 $ 1,554.6 Operating income: Drilling services $ 399.0 $ 472.1 $ 670.1 Manufacturing sales and services: Drilling products and systems (73.0 ) 3.4 (44.6 ) Mining, forestry and steel products 65.0 25.5 32.6 Total manufacturing sales and services (8.0 ) 28.9 (12.0 ) Total operating income $ 391.0 $ 501.0 $ 658.1 Net income $ 280.0 $ 367.5 $ 427.6 Rowans results of operations are primarily driven by the performance of our Drilling Services segment, which comprises about 95% of our fixed assets and over the past three years has generated two thirds of our consolidated revenues and over 90% of operating income. Costs and expenses in 2010 and 2008 included $42.0 million and $111.2 million, respectively, of certain items, which are discussed more fully in the detailed discussion of results of operations which follows. Added (deducted) from operating income to arrive at net income were the following (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Interest income $ 1.5 $ 1.2 $ 6.3 Interest expense, net of interest capitalized (24.9 ) (8.0 ) (1.2 ) Gain on debt extinguishment 5.3 Other income (expense) net 6.1 6.9 (9.1 ) Provision for income taxes (99.0 ) (133.6 ) (226.5 ) The increase in 2010 interest expense, net of interest capitalized, resulted from additional borrowings in 2009 and 2010 to finance our newbuild construction program and to refinance debt assumed in the SKDP acquisition. The gain on debt extinguishment in 2010 was attributable to the redemption of the assumed SKDP debt. See Liquidity and Capital Resources Financing Activities for further discussion. 24 Table of Contents Historically, we have conducted our foreign operations through U.S. subsidiaries, which resulted in income tax at or near the U.S. statutory rate of 35%. In late 2009, we began operating many of our foreign based rigs through our international subsidiaries, and we have asserted that such earnings are permanently reinvested abroad. As a result, we lowered our effective tax rate to 26.1% in 2010 as compared to 26.7% in 2009 and 34.6% in 2008. The reduced rate in 2009 compared to 2008 included the effect of operating rigs in our international subsidiaries for a part of 2009 and the effect of applying the facts of a third party tax case to our tax situation. That case provided a more favorable tax treatment for certain foreign contracts entered into in prior years. The reduced rate in 2010 was attributable to moving certain other rigs into our international subsidiaries and to having a greater proportion of income in lower tax jurisdictions. The full year impact of rig movements completed in 2010 combined with the startup of additional foreign owned rigs should lower our effective tax rate to the upper teens in 2011. The performance of each of our operating segments over the period from 2008 through 2010 is discussed more fully below. Drilling Services Drilling Services operating results are primarily a function of rig utilization and day rates achieved by our land and offshore rig fleets. Utilization and day rates are primarily determined by the level of oil and gas exploration and development expenditures, which are heavily influenced by trends in oil and natural gas prices, and the availability of competitive equipment. When drilling markets are strengthening, day rates generally lag the upward trend in rig utilization, and day rate increases can be more significant as utilization approaches 90% or more. When drilling markets are weakening, contractors often reduce day rates in an effort to maintain utilization. Both rig utilization and day rates have historically declined much faster than they have risen. Our Rig Fleets Our offshore fleet currently consists of 28 jack up rigs, featuring: Two N Class jack ups delivered in October 2010 and January 2011, Three EXL class jack ups delivered from May through December 2010, Two 240C class jack ups, delivered in 2008 and 2009, respectively, Four Tarzan Class jack ups delivered from 2004 through 2008, Four Super Gorilla class jack ups delivered from 1998 through 2003, Three Gorilla class jack ups built during the early 1980s, Seven 116C class jack ups built during the early 1980s, and Two 84 class jack ups and one 116 class jack up built during the mid to late 1970s. Sixteen of the twenty eight rigs in our jack up fleet have at least two million pounds of hook load capability, which enables efficient drilling beyond 30,000 feet. We consider such rigs to be high specification rigs, which include the N Class, EXL Class, 240Cs, Tarzan Class, Super Gorillas and one of the Gorilla class rigs. We have three additional high specification jack ups under construction the N Class Rowan Norway, the 240C Class Joe Douglas, and the EXL IV with expected deliveries from mid to late 2011. See further discussion of our offshore newbuild program under Liquidity and Capital Resources Investing Activities. In addition to our offshore fleet, we own a fleet of 30 land rigs, including 16 rigs constructed since 2005, four rigs built from 2001 through 2002, and ten older rigs that have been refurbished over the years. Current Operations and Markets Worldwide rig demand is inherently volatile and has historically varied among geographic markets, as has the supply of competitive equipment. Exploration and development expenditures can be impacted by many local factors, such as political and regulatory policies, seasonal weather patterns, lease expirations, new oil and gas discoveries and reservoir depletion. Over time, the level and expected direction of oil and natural gas prices are the principal determinants of drilling activity, and oil and gas prices are ultimately a function of the supply of and demand for those commodities. Our primary drilling markets are currently the U.S. Gulf of Mexico (US GOM), the Middle East, and the North Sea. We also have single rigs located in Mexico, Trinidad and Egypt. 25 Table of Contents The US GOM offshore drilling market is highly fragmented among several oil and gas companies, many of which are independent operators whose drilling activities may be highly dependent on near term operating cash flows. A typical drilling assignment may call for 60 days of exploration or development work performed under a single well contract with negotiable renewal options. Long term contracts have been relatively rare, and generally are available only from the major integrated oil companies and a few of the larger independent operators. Drilling activity and day rates in the US GOM have tended to fluctuate rather quickly, and generally follow trends in natural gas prices. Offshore drilling demand in the shallower waters of the US GOM has been weak over the last few years as a result of low natural gas prices. In 2010, the market slowed further as a result of the fallout from the Deepwater Horizon incident in April 2010 and the delayed permitting process that followed (see further discussion under Drilling Services Outlook). As of February 25, 2011, industry utilization in the US GOM was 42%. We currently have ten rigs in the US GOM six under contracts expiring in 2011, one commitment expiring in 2012 and two that are idle. One of the rigs under contract, the Ralph Coffman, is scheduled to begin mobilizing to the Middle East for a three year contract to commence in the third quarter of 2011. International markets present more opportunities for longer term drilling contracts and high specification rigs than do domestic markets. The relocation of rigs from domestic to foreign markets is a significant undertaking, and often interrupts revenues and cash flows for up to five months, particularly when equipment upgrades are involved. Thus, major relocations are typically carried out only when the likelihood of higher long term returns heavily outweighs the short term costs. The Middle East has been a primary focus among our international operations in recent years. We currently have three rigs operating in Saudi Arabia, three rigs operating in Qatar, and one in a shipyard in Bahrain undergoing modifications for a contract in Saudi Arabia (see also Drilling Outlook for further discussion). Three additional rigs are located in a shipyard in Dubai. As of February 25, 2011, industry utilization in the Middle East was 72%. Six of our ten rigs there have contracts expiring in 2011, two rigs (including the Ralph Coffman) have contracts expiring in 2014 and three rigs ar e idle. The North Sea is a mature, harsh environment offshore drilling market that has long been dominated by major oil and gas companies operating within a relatively tight regulatory environment. Project lead times are often lengthy, and drilling assignments, which typically require ultra premium equipment capable of handling extreme weather conditions and high down hole pressures and temperatures, can range from several months to several years. Thus, drilling activity and day rates in the North Sea move slowly in response to market conditions, and generally follow trends in oil prices. As of February 25, 2011, industry utilization in the North Sea was 87%. We currently have five rigs located in or en route to the North Sea, with contracts or commitments expiring from 2011 through 2013. Our remaining rigs outside the U.S. are the Rowan Gorilla IV, which is operating in the Gulf of Mexico under a contract that is expected to conclude in the third quarter of 2011, and the EXL II, which began a three year contract for work in Trinidad in early 2011. The J.P. Bussell recently completed work offshore Egypt and is currently available. In addition to our offshore rigs, at February 25, 2011, we had eighteen land rigs in Texas, eight in Louisiana, two in Oklahoma and one each in Alabama and Alaska, of which 24 were operating under contracts ranging from less than one to four years. 26 Table of Contents 2010 Compared to 2009 The following table highlights the performance of our Drilling Services segment during 2010 compared to 2009 (dollars in millions, except day rates): 2010 2009 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 1,208.8 100 % $ 1,214.9 100 % Operating costs (554.0 ) 46 % (525.2 ) 43 % Depreciation expense (170.2 ) 14 % (155.9 ) 13 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (85.0 ) 7 % (68.0 ) 6 % (Loss) gain on property disposals (0.6 ) 0 % 6.3 1 % Operating income $ 399.0 33 % $ 472.1 39 % Offshore fleet: Average day rate $ 162,300 $ 175,100 Revenue producing days 6,162 5,876 Available rig days 8,614 8,030 Rig utilization 72 % 73 % Land fleet: Average day rate $ 20,600 $ 23,200 Revenue producing days 8,947 7,175 Available rig days 11,312 11,503 Rig utilization 79 % 62 % The following table summarizes average prices for oil and natural gas and our utilization and average day rates by quarter in 2010, and for the full years 2010 and 2009 for our offshore fleet: Oil (per bbl) * Natural gas (per MCF) * Average utilization Average day rate 2010: First quarter $ 78.81 $ 4.99 75 % $ 183,200 Second quarter $ 77.82 $ 4.35 75 % $ 174,500 Third quarter $ 76.06 $ 4.24 72 % $ 147,300 Fourth quarter $ 85.16 $ 3.98 65 % $ 142,500 Full year: 2010 $ 79.48 $ 4.38 72 % $ 162,300 2009 $ 61.95 $ 4.16 73 % $ 175,100 * Source: New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) 27 Table of Contents Drilling revenues for 2010 decreased by $6.1 million, or less than 1%, compared to 2009 as a result of the following (in millions): Increase (Decrease) Lower average offshore day rates $ (62.2 ) Lower offshore rig utilization (49.2 ) Lower average land day rates (23.3 ) Addition of two land rigs1 4.1 Reimbursables and other, net 5.0 Higher land rig utilization 37.0 Addition of the Ralph Coffman and EXL I2 82.5 Net decrease $ (6.1 ) 1In the first and second quarters of 2009, we added two land rigs to the fleet, which together contributed an additional 162 revenue producing days in 2010 as compared to 2009. 2The Ralph Coffman and EXL I were added to the fleet in the first and second quarters of 2010 and together contributed 567 revenue producing days in 2010. The following table presents certain key performance measures by geographic area for our offshore fleet for 2010 and 2009. Revenues include those attributable to reimbursable costs. Average day rates are computed by dividing revenues recognized during the year, excluding reimbursables, by the number of revenue producing days. Rig utilization is computed as the number of revenue producing days divided by total available rig days. 2010 2009 Gulf of Mexico: Revenues $ 286,356,000 $ 297,206,000 Average day rate $ 133,600 $ 145,600 Utilization 68 % 64 % Middle East: Revenues $ 285,950,000 $ 373,059,000 Average day rate $ 140,900 $ 153,300 Utilization 61 % 74 % North Sea: Revenues $ 179,828,000 $ 172,610,000 Average day rate $ 227,100 $ 243,400 Utilization 94 % 97 % Other international: Revenues $ 264,348,000 $ 199,449,000 Average day rate $ 205,000 $ 257,600 Utilization 92 % 83 % Drilling operating costs in 2010 increased by $28.8 million, or by 5% from 2009, primarily due to personnel and related costs attributable to the 2010 fleet additions of the Ralph Coffman and EXL I.

Drilling depreciation expense increased by $14.3 million or 9% between periods due primarily to the addition of the Ralph Coffman and EXL I. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $17.0 million or 25% over 2009 due primarily to a $5.3 million provision for the cost of terminating the Companys agency agreement in Mexico and higher personnel related costs and professional fees. 2009 Compared to 2008 The following table highlights the performance of our Drilling Services segment during 2009 compared to 2008 (dollars in millions, except day rates): 2009 2008 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 1,214.9 100 % $ 1,451.6 100 % Operating costs (525.2 ) 43 % (629.8 ) 43 % Depreciation expense (155.9 ) 13 % (125.9 ) 9 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (68.0 ) 6 % (69.2 ) 5 % Gains on property disposals 6.3 1 % 68.0 5 % Material charges and other operating expenses 0 % (24.6 ) 2 % Operating income $ 472.1 39 % $ 670.1 46 % Offshore fleet: Average day rate $ 175,100 $ 163,200 Revenue producing days 5,876 7,313 Available rig days 8,030 7,663 Rig utilization 73 % 95 % Land fleet: Average day rate $ 23,200 $ 22,600 Revenue producing days 7,175 10,067 Available rig days 11,503 10,779 Rig utilization 62 % 93 % 29 Table of Contents The following table summarizes average prices for oil and natural gas and our utilization and average day rates by quarter in 2009, and for the full years 2009 and 2008 for our offshore fleet: Oil (per bbl) * Natural gas (per MCF) * Average utilization Average day rate 2009: First quarter $ 43.14 $ 4.47 93 % $ 173,600 Second quarter $ 59.61 $ 3.81 78 % $ 177,200 Third quarter $ 68.14 $ 3.44 59 % $ 182,500 Fourth quarter $ 76.00 $ 4.93 63 % $ 167,700 Full year: 2009 $ 61.95 $ 4.16 73 % $ 175,100 2008 $ 99.67 $ 8.90 95 % $ 163,200 * Source: New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) The dramatic declines in oil and natural gas prices that began in mid 2008 coupled with the weakness in the global capital markets increased our customers efforts to preserve liquidity and adversely affected the economics of certain drilling projects. Most oil and gas producers significantly reduced their 2009 drilling expenditures, and that reduction was most prominent for shallow water and onshore projects. The reduction in demand reduced global jack up and land rig utilization, increased competition among available rigs for fewer drilling assignments, and pressured day rates. Drilling revenues for 2009 decreased by $236.7 million, or 16%, compared to 2008 as a result of the following (in millions): Increase (Decrease) Lower offshore rig utilization $ (274.7 ) Lower land rig utilization (86.3 ) Loss of the Rowan Anchorage1 (15.2 ) Reimbursables and other, net (10.8 ) Higher average land day rates 1.9 Addition of four land rigs2 23.3 Higher average offshore day rates 45.6 Addition of the J.P.

Bussell and Rowan Mississippi commenced operations in November 2008 and contributed 548 revenue producing days in 2009, as compared to 86 days in 2008. 30 Table of Contents The following table presents certain key performance measures by geographic area for our offshore fleet for 2009 and 2008. Revenues include those attributable to reimbursable costs. Average day rates are computed by dividing revenues recognized during the year, excluding reimbursables, by the number of revenue producing days. Rig utilization is computed as the number of revenue producing days divided by total available rig days. 2009 2008 Gulf of Mexico: Revenues $ 297,206,000 $ 402,696,000 Average day rate $ 145,600 $ 129,900 Utilization 64 % 97 % Middle East: Revenues $ 373,059,000 $ 480,981,000 Average day rate $ 153,300 $ 155,400 Utilization 74 % 94 % North Sea: Revenues $ 172,610,000 $ 166,486,000 Average day rate $ 243,400 $ 244,900 Utilization 97 % 91 % Other international: Revenues $ 199,449,000 $ 158,988,000 Average day rate $ 257,600 $ 301,200 Utilization 83 % 98 % Drilling operating costs in 2009 decreased by $104.6 million, or 17% from 2008, as set forth in the table below (in millions): Increase (Decrease) % Change Personnel and related costs $ (55.3 ) 16 % Repairs and maintenance (27.5 ) 21 % Reimbursable expenses (9.8 ) 34 % Rig insurance costs (3.1 ) 7 % All other (8.9 ) 11 % Net decrease $ (104.6 ) 17 % The declines in personnel and related costs and repairs and maintenance expenses were primarily the result of reduced activity levels. Additionally, several shipyard upgrade projects on many of our idle rigs absorbed certain personnel related costs and resulted in lower routine repair and maintenance expenses that we would have otherwise incurred. Our average operating margin (revenues in excess of operating costs, other than depreciation and selling, general and administrative expenses) was 57% of revenues in both 2009 and 2008. Drilling depreciation expense increased by $30.0 million or 24% between periods due primarily to the addition of the J.P. Bussell and Rowan Mississippi in November 2008. 31 Table of Contents Outlook Our drilling backlog by geographic area as of February 25, 2011 (the date of our most recent Rig Fleet and Contract Status report), as compared to the prior year amount, is set forth below (in millions): February 25, 2011 February 16, 2010 Middle East $ 621 $ 275 North Sea 608 327 Gulf of Mexico 274 234 Other international 156 240 Subtotal offshore 1,659 1,076 Land 143 234 Total drilling backlog $ 1,802 $ 1,310 We estimate our drilling backlog will be realized as follows (in millions): Offshore Land Total 2011 $ 718 $ 75 $ 793 2012 618 37 655 2013 243 14 257 2014 80 14 94 2015 3 3 Total drilling backlog $ 1,659 $ 143 $ 1,802 About 44% of our remaining available offshore rig days in 2011 and 26% of available days in 2012 were under contract or commitment as of February 25, 2011. As of February 25, 2011, fifteen of our offshore rigs had drilling contracts estimated to complete in 2011, three had contracts or commitments estimated to complete in 2012, one had a contract estimated to complete in 2013, three had contracts estimated to complete in 2014, and six were available. Additionally, the Rowan Norway, which is currently under construction with an expected delivery date of June 2011, has a 240 day contract for work in the UK sector of the North Sea beginning in late 2011, plus a one year priced option. One of the two remaining rigs under construction has a verbal commitment for up to about one year of work, and the other rig under construction was without a commitment. In each of the past several years, the onset of hurricane season has coincided with declines in drilling activity in the US GOM. We expect this pattern to continue in future years. In response to the Deepwater Horizon incident on April 20, 2010, and subsequent oil spill, the U.S. Secretary of the Interior on May 27, 2010, announced a moratorium on U.S. offshore deepwater drilling, which was subsequently lifted on October 12, 2010. In addition, the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement (BOEMRE), which was formerly known as the Minerals Management Service, issued Notices to Lessees (NTLs) implementing new safety regulations applicable to drilling operations in the Gulf of Mexico. These NTLs have adversely impacted the ability of our customers to obtain necessary permits and approval on a timely basis and or to continue operations uninterrupted under existing permits. On October 15, 2010, the BOEMRE issued new regulations which formalized many of the requirements set for th in the NTLs and issued additional environmental and safety requirements. We believe the impact of the NTLs and delayed permitting process on our US GOM operating results has not been significant to date; however, we can provide no assurance that will continue to be the case going forward. In recent years, we have significantly expanded our operations internationally. Foreign operations are often subject to political, economic and other uncertainties not typically encountered in domestic operations. Recent political unrest in Egypt and other Middle East countries could spread to nearby areas where we have operations. Such unrest could potentially delay projects, either planned or currently in progress, or could impact the Company in other unforeseen ways. Any such unforeseen events could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We 32 Table of Contents currently have three rigs operating in Saudi Arabia, three rigs operating in Qatar, one rig in a shipyard in Bahrain undergoing modifications for a contract in Saudi Arabia, three idle rigs in Dubai, and one idle rig in Egypt. We believe there are currently 67 jack ups under construction for completion over the next three years, most of which do not have drilling contracts in place. Delivery of those rigs is expected to further increase competition among jack up contractors. Thus, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to continue to replace our contract backlog as it is realized, that we can maintain current utilization levels, that spot day rates will remain above breakeven levels, or that our drilling operations will remain profitable. Manufacturing Operations Overview Our manufacturing operations are conducted by LeTourneau Technologies, Inc, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and consist of two business segments Drilling Products and Systems and Mining, Forestry and Steel products. The Drilling Products and Systems segment provides equipment, parts and services for the offshore and onshore oil and gas drilling industry. Featured products include complete jack up rigs, rig kits and component packages, primary drilling equipment such as mud pumps, drawworks, top drives and rotary tables, and electrical components such as variable speed motors and drives. Our Drilling Products and Systems segment is currently constructing our third 240C class rig, the Joe Douglas, for delivery later in 2011. The Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment produces large wheeled mining and timber equipment and related parts and carbon and alloy steel and steel plate. Demand for our manufactured products is significantly influenced by the level and direction of world commodities prices. Results for our Drilling Products and Systems segment are highly correlated to the condition of the oil and gas production industry and demand for drilling equipment, parts and services, which are in turn impacted by the level and direction of oil and natural gas prices. The prospects for our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment are strongly affected by prices for copper, iron ore, coal and timber. Our manufacturing revenues in any period are impacted by the timing of product shipments, and our profitability is affected in part by the mix of product sales. Original equipment sales, for example, have traditionally yielded lower margins than the related after market parts sales. Land rigs and component packages typically require more costs for commissioning than do individual pumps and other drilling equipment, and often carry a package discount. Thus, our gross margins are typically higher on equipment sales than on rigs and component packages. 2010 Compared to 2009 Drilling Products and Systems The following table highlights the performance of our Drilling Products and Systems segment in 2010 and 2009 (dollars in millions): 2010 2009 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 310.3 100 % $ 369.4 100 % Operating costs (305.8 ) 99 % (341.0 ) 92 % Depreciation expense (8.6 ) 3 % (9.0 ) 2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (26.9 ) 9 % (16.0 ) 4 % Material charge manufacturing inventories (42.0 ) 14 % 0 % Operating income (loss) $ (73.0 ) 24 % $ 3.4 1 % 33 Table of Contents Revenues from Drilling Products and Systems decreased by $59.1 million or 16% between periods due to the following (in millions): Increase (Decrease) Higher revenues recognized on offshore rig kits in progress $ 70.7 Lower sales of land rigs and rig kits (62.3 ) Lower sales of power system packages and motors (33.4 ) Lower mud pump sales (22.9 ) Lower parts sales (8.1 ) Other, net (3.1 ) Net decrease $ (59.1 ) Our average operating margin (revenues in excess of operating costs, other than depreciation and selling, general and administrative expenses and material charges) declined to 1% of revenues in 2010 from 8% in 2009. The lower margin in 2010 was primarily attributable to much lower sales volumes and higher warranty costs. (Management believes that average operating margin, as defined, is a more meaningful measure of performance in a discussion of results of manufacturing operations, than absolute changes in operating costs.) Selling, general and administrative costs increased by $10.9 million between periods due primarily to the addition of personnel in the fourth quarter of 2009 and first quarter of 2010, incremental costs in connection with a quality initiative at the Companys manufacturing operations and due to higher bad debt expense. In early 2010, the Drilling Products and Systems segment performed an assessment of its Houston based raw materials and supplies inventory. As a result of the assessment, the Company increased its inventory valuation reserve by approximately $42.0 million and recorded a corresponding charge to expense in the first quarter of 2010. See Inventories in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Our Drilling Products and Systems operating results for 2010 exclude $205.0 million of revenues and $148.3 million of expenses in connection with sales of products and services to our Drilling Services segment, most of which was attributable to construction of the newbuild jack up, Joe Douglas. Drilling Products and Systems operating results for 2009 excludes $278.9 million of revenues and $182.3 million of expenses most of which was attributable to construction of the newbuild jack up, Ralph Coffman, and kits and equipment provided for our EXL rigs. Mining, Forestry and Steel Products The following table highlights the performance of our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment for 2010 and 2009 (dollars in millions): 2010 2009 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 300.1 100 % $ 185.9 100 % Operating costs (206.5 ) 69 % (134.6 ) 72 % Depreciation expense (7.8 ) 3 % (6.5 ) 3 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (20.6 ) 7 % (18.8 ) 10 % Net loss on property disposals (0.2 ) 0 % (0.5 ) 0 % Operating income $ 65.0 22 % $ 25.5 14 % 34 Table of Contents Revenues from Mining, Forestry and Steel Products increased by $114.2 million or 61% between periods due to the following (in millions): Increase (Decrease) Higher sales of mining loaders (25 loaders in 2010 compared to 14 in 2009) $ 63.0 Higher sales of parts 35.2 Higher sales of steel plate 7.7 Other, net 8.3 Net increase $ 114.2 Our average operating margin (revenues in excess of operating costs, other than depreciation and selling, general and administrative expenses) increased to 31% of revenues in 2010 from 28% in 2009. The higher margin was attributable to increased sales volumes as well as product sales mix, particularly a greater proportion of higher margin mining loaders and parts sales in 2010. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $1.8 million or 10% between periods primarily due to the settlement of a 2001 Chilean arbitration in connection with the loss of a loader sustained by a customer. 2009 Compared to 2008 Drilling Products and Systems The following table highlights the performance of our Drilling Products and Systems segment for 2009 and 2008 (dollars in millions): 2009 2008 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 369.4 100 % $ 493.5 100 % Operating costs (341.0 ) 92 % (421.5 ) 85 % Depreciation expense (9.0 ) 2 % (9.5 ) 2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (16.0 ) 4 % (25.1 ) 5 % Material charges and other operating expenses 0 % (81.9 ) 17 % Net gain (loss) on property disposals 0 % (0.1 ) 0 % Operating income (loss) $ 3.4 1 % $ (44.6 ) 9 % Revenues from Drilling Products and Systems decreased by $124.1 million, or 25%, between periods due primarily to the following: A decrease of $78.0 million attributable to $111.6 million of revenues recognized on five offshore rig kit projects in 2009, as compared to $189.6 million recognized on eight projects in 2008; A decrease of $36.3 million attributable to $103.0 million recognized on shipments of land rigs and component packages in 2009, down from $139.3 million in 2008; A decrease of $23.8 million attributable to $1.9 million of revenues recognized on shipments of top drives in 2009, down from $25.7 million in 2008; An increase of $8.6 million attributable to $50.1 million recognized on 57 mud pumps shipped in 2009, up from $41.5 million on 63 pumps in 2008. Our average operating margin (revenues in excess of operating costs, other than depreciation, selling, general and administrative expenses and material charges) decreased to 8% of revenues in 2009 from 15% in 2008. Margins in 2009 were negatively affected by sales mix, with a greater share of revenues from some of our lower margin products as compared to the prior year and poor results on several land rig projects. Selling, general and administrative costs declined by $9.1 million or 36% between periods due primarily to lower compensation and related fringe benefit costs associated with reduced employment levels. 35 Table of Contents Our Drilling Products and Systems operating results for 2009 exclude $278.9 million of revenues and $182.3 million of expenses in connection with sales of products and services to our Drilling Services segment, much of which was attributable to construction of the newbuild jack up, Ralph Coffman, and kits and equipment provided for our EXL rigs. Drilling Products and Systems operating results for 2008 excludes $382.9 million of revenues and $307.7 million of expenses, primarily for construction of the J.P. Bussell, Rowan Mississippi and Ralph Coffman. Mining, Forestry and Steel Products The following table highlights the performance of our Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segment for 2009 and 2008 (dollars in millions): 2009 2008 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 185.9 100 % $ 267.6 100 % Operating costs (134.6 ) 72 % (203.3 ) 76 % Depreciation expense (6.5 ) 3 % (6.1 ) 2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (18.8 ) 10 % (20.8 ) 8 % Material charges and other operating expenses 0 % (4.7 ) 2 % Net loss on property disposals (0.5 ) 0 % (0.1 ) 0 % Operating income $ 25.5 14 % $ 32.6 12 % Revenues from Mining, Forestry and Steel Products decreased by $81.7 million or 31% between periods due primarily to the following: Lower sales of new mining loaders and forestry stackers, which declined by $38.9 million or 38%, from $102.6 million in 2008 to $63.7 million in 2009. We shipped 14 new mining loaders and forestry stackers in 2009, as compared to 29 units in 2008; Lower sales of steel plate, which declined by $35.0 million or 52%, from $66.9 million in 2008 to $31.9 million in 2009; A two percent increase in part sales, to $73.3 million in 2009 from $71.9 million in 2008. Our average operating margin (revenues in excess of operating costs, other than depreciation, selling, general and administrative expenses and material charges) increased to 28% of revenues in 2009 from 24% in 2008. The higher margins were attributable to primarily product sales mix, particularly a greater proportion of higher margin after market parts and service revenues in 2009. (Management believes that average operating margin, as defined, is a more meaningful measure of performance in a discussion of results of manufacturing operations, than absolute changes in operating costs.) Outlook Our external manufacturing backlog includes executed contracts and customer commitments and comprised the following (in millions): December 31, 2010 2009 Mining, Forestry, and Steel Products Mining loaders $ 132 $ 67 Drilling Products and Systems Offshore rig projects 70 217 Drilling Products and Systems Land rig projects 38 71 Drilling Products and Systems Drilling equipment 22 29 Drilling Products and Systems Parts, power systems and other components 20 14 Mining, Forestry, and Steel products Other parts and steel products 17 15 Total manufacturing backlog $ 299 $ 413 We expect a substantial majority of our external manufacturing backlog at December 31, 2010, will be realized as revenue in 2011. The changes reflected in the table above were indicative of the trends for most of 2010 in each of our significant product lines. Beginning in late 2010 and more recently, however, requests for quotations have increased at Drilling 36 Table of Contents Products and Systems, especially for offshore rig kits and related drilling equipment packages. We believe we will be successful at obtaining new business in these areas. As reflected in the preceding table, our backlog of mining and forestry equipment improved significantly during 2010. In December 2010, we received an order to manufacture and deliver 15 front end wheel loaders, valued at approximately $85 million, which is included in our backlog at December 31. The loaders, purchased by a single customer for iron ore mining operations in Brazil, are scheduled for delivery throughout 2011. The global mining equipment market has been increasingly active throughout 2010 and into 2011, and we believe 2011 will be a strong year for our Mining Products business. We can provide no assurance we will be able to maintain or significantly increase our backlog going forward. We currently have no further plans for rig construction at our Vicksburg shipyard following the delivery of our third 240C class rig, the Joe Douglas, in 2011, but may continue to use the facility for other operations. Absent additional orders or sufficient prospects for future work, the activities at the facility would be significantly reduced at that time, in which case we would incur additional costs such as employee severance, among other charges. Closing or significantly reducing activity levels at the facility could result in the incurrence of cash charges ranging from $8 million to $10 million. A key element of our strategy has been to separate our manufacturing operations from our core offshore drilling operations when market conditions were suitable. We believe conditions are suitable now and expect to begin a process in 2011 to sell or spin off our manufacturing operations. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Key balance sheet amounts and ratios for 2010 and 2009 were as follows (dollars in millions): December 31, 2010 2009 Cash and cash equivalents $ 437.5 $ 639.7 Current assets $ 1,324.8 $ 1,549.8 Current liabilities $ 529.2 $ 568.3 Current ratio 2.50 2.73 Current maturities of long term debt $ 52.2 $ 64.9 Long term debt, less current maturities $ 1,133.7 $ 787.5 Stockholders equity $ 3,752.3 $ 3,110.4 Long term debt/total capitalization 0.23 0.20 Reflected in the comparison above are the effects of the following sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents in 2010, with comparable amounts for 2009: 2010 2009 Net operating cash flows $ 508.2 $ 544.1 Borrowings, net of issue costs 395.5 491.7 Proceeds from equity compensation and debenture plans and other 8.0 1.5 Proceeds from asset disposals 3.3 8.6 Net change in restricted cash balance (15.3 ) Net cash used in acquisition of SKDP (17.7 ) Capital expenditures (490.6 ) (566.4 ) Debt repayments (594.0 ) (64.9 ) All other, net 0.4 2.7 Total sources (uses) $ (202.2 ) $ 417.3 37 Table of Contents Operating Cash Flows Our cash flows from operations in 2010 and 2009 have benefited from long term drilling contracts entered into when rates were significantly higher than current market rates. As a result, operating cash flows have been and may continue to be negatively affected as these higher day rate contracts are completed. This impact, however, has been and should continue to be at least partially offset as a result of our newbuild offshore rig additions, particularly in 2010 and planned for 2011. Management believes that 2011 cash flow from operating activities will not be sufficient to fund its current rig construction program, which should be completed in 2011, and its 2011 debt service requirements, and as a result, anticipates drawing down on the Companys $350 million term loan facility in the first half of the year. (See further discussion under Financing Activities.) Investing Activities In September 2010, we completed our acquisition of Skeie Drilling & Production ASA, a Norwegian entity that owned and managed the construction of three high spec jack up rigs, designated N Class, designed and being built by Keppel FELS Ltd. in Singapore. In connection with the transaction, the Company issued 11.7 million shares of Rowan common stock valued at $338 million, assumed first and second lien debt with a par value of $492 million as of the September 10, 2010 acquisition date (the Acquisition Date) and acquired net cash of $201 million, including restricted cash of $219 million. We used the $219 million of restricted cash in the fourth quarter of 2010 to make the final shipyard payment for the Rowan Viking. Capital expenditures for 2010 are reported net of this final payment. Refer to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Form 10 K regarding the status of our newbuild rig projects. Significant capital expenditures in 2010 included the following: $235 million towards construction of the four EXL class rigs; $102 million towards construction of our third 240C class rig, the Joe Douglas; $89 million for improvements to the existing offshore fleet; $8 million towards construction of the Rowan Viking, Rowan Stavanger and Rowan Norway (net of $219 million of restricted cash acquired from SKDP); and $57 million for equipment spares, drill pipe and other. Our 2011 capital budget, as approved by our Board of Directors, is approximately $1.06 billion, and includes $500 million for the completion of the Rowan Stavanger and Rowan Norway, $154 million for completion of the Joe Douglas and the EXL IV, $213 million for upgrades to existing rigs and spare drilling equipment, $159 million pursuant to contractual requirements that will be substantially reimbursed by customers, and $38 million for manufacturing facilities and other. The capital budget reflects an appropriation of money that we may or may not spend, and the timing of such expenditures may change. We will periodically review and adjust the capital budget as necessary based upon current and forecasted cash flows and liquidity, anticipated market conditions in our drilling and manufacturing businesses, the availability of financing sources, and alternative uses of capital to enhance shareholder value. Certain such adjustments would require Board approval. Financing Activities On August 30, 2010, we completed the issuance and sale of $400 million aggregate principal amount of 5.0% Senior Notes due September 1, 2017 (the 5% Senior Notes). Net proceeds to the Company, after underwriting discount and offering expenses, were $395.5 million, which we used in 2010 to retire higher coupon SKDP debt. Interest on the Senior Notes is payable semi annually on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing March 1, 2011. The Company may, at its option, redeem all or part of the 5% Senior Notes at any time at a make whole price. The 5% Senior Notes are general unsecured, senior obligations. Accordingly, the 5% Senior Notes rank (i) pari passu in right of payment with any of the Companys existing and future unsecured indebtedness that is not by its terms subordinated to the 5% Senior Notes, including any indebtedness under the Companys senior revolving credit facility (other than letter of credit reimbursement obligations that are secured by cash deposits), (ii) effectively junior to the Companys existing and future secured indebtedness (including indebtedness under its secured notes issued pursuant to the MARAD Title XI program to finance several offshore drilling r igs), in each case, to the extent of the value of the Companys assets constituting collateral 38 Table of Contents securing that indebtedness and (iii) effectively junior to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Companys subsidiaries (other than indebtedness and liabilities owed to the Company). In connection with the acquisition of SKDP, we assumed first and second lien SKDP bonds with a par value of approximately $225 million and $267 million, respectively, as of the Acquisition Date. The first and second lien bonds were revalued and recognized at fair value aggregating $250 million and $279 million, respectively. In the third and fourth quarters of 2010, we retired all of the SKDP debt through a combination of open market purchases and redemption, and recognized a net gain on extinguishment of $5.3 million in 2010. Such amount is included in other income and expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Certain of the SKDP bondholders disputed our ability to call the debt in 2010; consequently, we deposited in escrow with the bond trustee $15.3 million, which is classified as restricted cash on our Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2010, to cover interest that would accrue on the first lien bonds until their May 2011 call date, and on the second lien bonds until their respective call dates in February, March and July 2011. We expect to prevail in this matter and fully recoup the escrowed amount. On September 16, 2010, we terminated our $155 million revolving credit facility agreement dated June 23, 2008, and entered into a new credit agreement with a group of banks (the 2010 Credit Agreement) under which we may borrow up to $250 million on a revolving basis through September 16, 2014, and up to $350 million on a term basis. The term loan has a final maturity date of September 16, 2015. Term advances are limited to reimbursements for repayments of debt assumed in the SKDP acquisition and must be drawn by July 31, 2011. Interest and commitment fees payable under the 2010 Credit Agreement are based in part on the Companys then current credit ratings. The annual commitment fee is currently .45% of the unused commitment. Advances would currently bear intere st at Libor plus 2.375% per annum. There were no amounts drawn under the 2010 Credit Agreement at December 31, 2010. The 2010 Credit Agreement limits total consolidated indebtedness and contains events of default, the occurrence of which may trigger an acceleration of amounts outstanding under the agreement. We currently expect to fully draw down our $350 million term loan facility over the first half of 2011. Our $250 million revolving credit facility should remain undrawn in 2011. We currently estimate our interest cost for 2011 to be in the $80 million range, of which approximately 40% would be capitalized as part of our rig construction costs. We were in compliance with each of our debt covenants at December 31, 2010, and we expect to remain in compliance in 2011. Pension Obligations Minimum pension contributions are determined based upon actuarial calculations of pension assets and liabilities that involve, among other things, assumptions about long term asset returns and interest rates. Similar calculations were used to estimate pension costs and obligations as reflected in our consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2010, our financial statements reflected an aggregate unfunded pension liability of $159 million, most of which relates to our drilling employees plan. In order to slow the rate at which plan benefits were growing, we amended the benefit formula for new drilling plan entrants effective January 1, 2008, and further amended the plan for remaining active participants effective July 1, 2009. The plan changes that became effective in 2009 re sulted in an approximately $15 million annualized reduction in pension expense. Despite the changes to the plan, we will continue to make significant pension contributions over the next several years, and additional funding would be required if asset values decline. We currently expect to make minimum contributions to our defined benefit pension plans of approximately $53 million in 2011. Cash Dividends The Company last paid a regular quarterly cash dividend in November 2008 and there are no current plans for dividend payments. Future dividends, if any, will only be paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors. At December 31, 2010, we had approximately $427 million available for distribution to stockholders under provisions of our debt agreements. Off balance Sheet Arrangements The Company had no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2010 or 2009, other than operating lease obligations and other commitments in the ordinary course of business (see Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments below). 39 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations and Commercial Commitments The following is a summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2010 (dollars in millions): Payments due by period Total Within 1 year 2 to 3 years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Long term debt, including interest $ 1,737 $ 122 $ 218 $ 175 $ 1,222 Newbuild construction contracts 654 654 Purchase obligations, excluding newbuilds 60 60 Operating leases 27 6 7 5 9 Total $ 2,478 $ 842 $ 225 $ 180 $ 1,231 We periodically employ letters of credit or other bank issued guarantees in the normal course of our businesses, and had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $70.3 million at December 31, 2010. Based on current and anticipated near term operating levels, we believe that operating cash flows together with existing working capital and the anticipated drawdown of our $350 million term loan facility in 2011 will be adequate to sustain planned capital expenditures and debt service and other requirements in 2011. Contingent Liabilities Reference should be made to Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for a discussion of the status of significant legal proceedings. Critical Accounting Policies and Management Estimates Rowans significant accounting policies are presented in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. These policies, and management judgments, assumptions and estimates made in their application underlie reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that our most critical accounting policies and management estimates involve revenue recognition for longer term manufacturing contracts accounted for under the percentage of completion method of accounting, inventories (primarily valuation allowances for excess and obsolete inventories), carrying values of long lived assets, pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs (specifica lly assumptions used in actuarial calculations), and income taxes (particularly our estimated reserves for uncertain tax positions), as changes in such policies and or estimates would produce significantly different amounts from those reported herein. Revenue recognition under the percentage of completion method We generally recognize manufacturing sales and related costs when title passes as products are shipped. Revenues from longer term contracts such as for the construction of offshore rigs and rig kits are recognized on the percentage of completion basis using contract costs incurred relative to total estimated project costs. An offshore rig construction project typically occurs over a two year period at our Vicksburg, Mississippi, shipyard and includes a significant labor cost component for fabrication and assembly. A rig kit includes selected rig components and parts manufactured over a six to nine month period in our Longview, Texas, facility. Costs are recorded separately for each offshore rig or rig kit project, and by significant activity or component within each project, and include mate rials issued to the project, labor expenses that are incurred directly for the project and overhead expenses that are allocated across all projects at consistent rates per labor hour. Incurred costs include only those that measure project work performed. Material costs incurred, for example, do not include materials purchased but remaining in inventory; only when such materials have been used in production on the project are they included in incurred project costs. The determination of total estimated project costs is performed monthly based upon then current information. This process involves an evaluation of progress towards project milestones and an assessment of work left to complete each project activity or component, and is based on physical observations by project managers and engineers. An estimate of project costs is then developed for each significant activity or component based upon the assessment of project status, actual costs incurred to da te and outstanding commitments for project materials and services. We do not recognize any estimated profit until such projects are at least 10% complete, though a full provision is made immediately for any anticipated losses. 40 Table of Contents We have not experienced any significant fluctuations in the percentage of completion measurements in recent periods, nor have we incurred any losses on such projects. In 2010 we recognized $100.1 million of manufacturing revenues and $64.3 million of costs related to rig kit projects on the percentage of completion basis. Inventories Inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or estimated net realizable value. Costs include labor, material and an allocation of production overhead. We determine valuation allowances or reserves for inventories based on historical usage of inventories on hand, assumptions about future demand based on market conditions, and estimates about potential alternative uses, which are usually limited. Our inventories generally consist of spare parts, work in process, and raw materials to support ongoing manufacturing operations and the Companys installed base of drilling, mining and timber equipment. Customers rely on us to stock these specialized items to ensure that their equipment can be repaired and serviced in a timely manner. The estimated carrying values of our inventories the refore ultimately depend upon demand driven by oil, natural gas and other commodity prices, general economic conditions worldwide and the potential obsolescence of various types of equipment we sell, among other factors. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, our inventory reserves totaled 16% and 8% of gross inventories, respectively. As a result of declines in oil and natural gas prices, the onset of global recession and weakness in capital markets in 2008, we reduced our estimates of the future usage of our drilling equipment inventories and significantly increased our inventory valuation reserves at December 31, 2008. In early 2010, we made a similar adjustment to the inventory valuation reserve in the amount of $42.0 million. See Inventories in Note 2 for further information. Deterioration in worldwide demand for oil, natural gas and certain other commodities, or the development of new technologies which make older drilling, mining and timber equipment technologies obsolete, could require us to record additional reserves to reduce the value of our inventory. Impairment of long lived assets We evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment, primarily our drilling rigs, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such rigs may not be recoverable. Generally, extended periods of idle time and or our inability to contract rigs at economical rates are an indication that a rig may be impaired. However, the offshore drilling industry has historically been highly cyclical and it is not unusual for rigs to be unutilized or underutilized for extended periods of time and subsequently resume full or near full utilization when business cycles improve. Likewise, during periods of excess supply, rigs are frequently contracted at or near cash break even rates for extended periods. Impairment situations may arise with respect to specific individual rigs , groups of rigs, such as a specific type of drilling rig, or rigs in a certain geographic region. Our rigs are mobile and may generally be moved from regions with excess supply, if economically feasible. Asset impairment evaluations are, by nature, highly subjective. In most instances, they involve expectations of future cash flows to be generated by our drilling rigs and are based on managements judgments and assumptions regarding future industry conditions and operations, as well as managements estimates of future expected utilization, contract rates, expense levels and capital requirements of our drilling rigs. The estimates, judgments and assumptions used by management in the application of our asset impairment policies reflect both historical experience and an assessment of current operational, industry, market, economic and political environments. The use of different estimates, judgments, assumptions and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations would likely result in mat erially different asset carrying values and operating results. Pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs Our pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs are based upon actuarial computations that reflect our assumptions about future events, including long term asset returns, interest rates, annual compensation increases, mortality rates and other factors. Key assumptions at December 31, 2010, included discount rates ranging from 5.26% to 5.46%, an expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets of 8% and annual healthcare cost increases ranging from 8.4% in 2011 to 4.5% in 2029 and beyond. The assumed discount rate is based upon the average yield for Moodys Aa rated corporate bonds and the rate of return assumption reflects a probability distribution of expected long term returns that is weighted based upon plan asset allocations. A one percentage point decrease in the as sumed discount rate would increase our recorded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities by approximately $97 million, while a one percentage point change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would change annual net benefits cost by approximately $3.8 million. A one percentage point increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would increase 2011 other postretirement benefit cost by $0.5 million. To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, Rowan considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the plans other asset classes and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The 41 Table of Contents expected return for each asset class was then weighted based upon the current asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for the plan, which was maintained at 8% at December 31, 2010, unchanged from December 31, 2009. Income taxes In accordance with accounting guidelines for income tax uncertainties, we evaluate each tax position to determine if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on its merits. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in income for the period, and a reserve, if any. Our income tax returns are subject to audit by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. Determinations by such taxing authorities that differ materially from our recorded estimates, either favorably or unfavorably, may have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We believe our reserve for uncertain tax positions tota ling $51.8 million at December 31, 2010, is properly recorded in accordance with the accounting guidelines. New Accounting Standards There have been no new accounting standards issued that are expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial statements upon adoption. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS Rowans outstanding debt at December 31, 2010, consisted entirely of fixed rate debt with a carrying value of $1,186 million, bearing a weighted average annual interest rate of 5.9%. Due to the fixed rate nature of the Companys debt, management believes the risk of loss due to changes in market interest rates is not material. The majority of Rowans transactions are denominated in United States dollars. The Company has some exposure to currency exchange fluctuations primarily in Brazil and Australia as a result of its manufacturing presence in those countries. In order to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, Rowan generally requires customer payments to be in U.S. dollars and limits foreign currency holdings to the extent they are needed to pay liabilities denominated in such currencies.
