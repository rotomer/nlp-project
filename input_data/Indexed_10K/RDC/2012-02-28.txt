ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW In 2011, we executed several transactions consistent with our long stated strategy. During the year, we sold our manufacturing and land drilling services businesses, and received over $1.5 billion in cash. In addition, in 2011 we placed into service six newly acquired high specification jack ups the EXL II, III and IV, and the Rowan Viking, Rowan Stavanger and Rowan Norway, and completed construction of the Joe Douglas, which is expected to enter service in the first quarter of 2012. This brings to 19 the number of high specification rigs currently in service and represents a 58% increase in our high spec capacity over 2010. Finally, we entered into contracts for the construction of three ultra deepwater drillships, the first of which is to be delivered in late 2013. These transactions capped multi year efforts to focus our energy and resources on our core high specification offshore drilling business and to expand into the growing ultra deepwater drilling segment. Our financial performance during the year was negatively impacted by the effects of rig relocations and shipyard time as we prepared for several new international contracts. During the year, we had nine rigs moving to, or preparing for, new contracts, and several of those projects took longer than anticipated. We estimate that approximately 22% of our available rig days in 2011 were spent by rigs in shipyards or in transit. The combined effect of being off day rate longer than expected and the higher repair and maintenance expense that often accompanies extended shipyard stays hurt our performance. Seven of these rigs have returned to work and we expect the remainder to return to work during the first quarter of 2012. Three of our rigs in the Middle East are expected to enter the shipyard in 2012 for customer required well control equipment upgrades. Additional shipyard time will be incurred by other rigs in 2012 to meet customer or regulatory requirements and receive needed upgrades. We currently expect that approximately 11% of our available rig days in 2012 will be spent by rigs in shipyards or in transit. In addition, we estimate that we lost approximately $30 million in revenues in 2011 as a result of equipment downtime in excess of contract allowances, most of which was related to top drives and pipe handling equipment on our North Sea rigs. We otherwise have maintained a high level of utilization for our higher specification rigs, as oil and gas companies have increasingly sought more capable equipment to meet more demanding drilling requirements. The market for our less capable rigs, however, continues to be weak, and those rigs have experienced extended periods of idle time. We believe this segmentation of demand based on rig capability will continue. Utilization of our high specification jack ups for 2011 was 83%, as compared to 49% and 28% for our premium and conventional jack ups, respectively. We define high specification jack ups as those that have hook load capacity of at least two million pounds, and we define premium jack ups as those cantilevered rigs capable of operating in water depths of 300 feet or more. As of February 27, 2012, we had eleven jack ups in the Middle East, ten in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, six in the North Sea, two in Trinidad, and one each in Malaysia and Vietnam. At that date, eleven had contracts estimated to complete in 2012, two had contracts estimated to complete in 2013, ten had contracts estimated to complete in 2014, three had contracts estimated to complete in 2016, and five were available. As a result of the sales of our manufacturing and land drilling businesses, we have reclassified the results of those former operations to discontinued operations in the comparative financial information and related discussions that follow for all periods presented. Our manufacturing operations were previously reported as the Drilling Products and Systems and the Mining, Forestry and Steel Products segments, and our land drilling operations were previously reported as a component of our Drilling Services segment. The Company does not currently segment its remaining offshore drilling business for reporting purposes. In February 2012, the Companys Board of Directors approved a plan of redomestication that, if approved by the Companys stockholders and certain other closing conditions are met, would result in the Company changing its jurisdiction of incorporation from Delaware to the United Kingdom. The Company intends to pursue the redomestication in 2012. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our profitability is primarily a function of our ability to keep our rigs under contract and the operating day rates received, but is also impacted by the level of downtime while a rig is under contract, during which period the company may receive a reduced day rate or no day rate. Our ability to obtain contracts for our rigs and the day rates received are primarily determined by the level of oil and gas exploration and development expenditures, which are heavily influenced by trends in oil and natural gas prices and the availability of competitive equipment. When drilling markets are strengthening, day rates generally lag the upward trend in rig utilization, and day rate increases can be more significant as utilization approaches 90% 21 Table of Contents or more. When drilling markets are weakening, contractors often reduce day rates in an effort to maintain utilization. Both rig utilization and day rates have historically declined much faster than they have risen. The following table summarizes average prices for oil and natural gas and the Companys utilization and average day rates for the periods indicated: Oil (per bbl) * Natural gas (per MCF) * Average utilization Average day rate 2011: First quarter $ 94.07 $ 4.20 65 % $ 136,352 Second quarter $ 102.02 $ 4.38 70 % $ 133,279 Third quarter $ 89.49 $ 4.06 61 % $ 148,491 Fourth quarter $ 93.78 $ 3.50 68 % $ 149,868 2010: First quarter $ 78.81 $ 4.99 75 % $ 183,210 Second quarter $ 77.82 $ 4.35 75 % $ 174,542 Third quarter $ 76.06 $ 4.24 72 % $ 147,257 Fourth quarter $ 85.16 $ 3.98 65 % $ 142,539 Full year: 2011 $ 94.83 $ 4.04 66 % $ 142,083 2010 $ 79.48 $ 4.38 72 % $ 162,272 2009 $ 61.95 $ 4.16 73 % $ 175,081 * Source: New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) Current Operations and Markets Worldwide rig demand is inherently volatile and has historically varied among geographic markets, as has the supply of competitive equipment. Exploration and development expenditures can be impacted by many local factors, such as political and regulatory policies, seasonal weather patterns, lease expirations, new oil and gas discoveries and reservoir depletion. Over time, the level and expected direction of oil and natural gas prices are the principal determinants of drilling activity, and oil and gas prices are ultimately a function of the supply of and demand for those commodities. Our primary drilling markets are currently the US GOM, the Middle East and the North Sea. We also have rigs operating in Trinidad, Malaysia and Vietnam. The US GOM jack up drilling market is highly fragmented among several oil and gas companies, many of which are independent operators whose drilling activities may be highly dependent on near term operating cash flows. A typical drilling assignment may call for 60 days of exploration or development work performed under a single well contract with negotiable renewal options. Long term contracts for jack up rigs have been relatively rare, and generally are available only from the major integrated oil companies and a few of the larger independent operators. Drilling activity and day rates in the US GOM have tended to fluctuate rather quickly, and generally follow trends in natural gas prices. Drilling demand in the shallow waters of the US GOM has been weak over the last few years as a result of increasing supplies of natural gas and declining prices. In 2010, the market slowed further as a result of the fallout from the Macondo well incident in April 2010 and the delayed permitting process that followed. As of February 24, 2012, industry utilization for jack up rigs in the US GOM was 56%. At February 27, 2012, we had ten rigs in the US GOM six under contracts expiring in 2012, one expiring in 2014 and three that were idle or pending contract startups. International markets present more opportunities for longer term drilling contracts and high specification rigs than do domestic markets. The relocation of rigs from domestic to foreign markets is a significant undertaking, and often interrupts revenues and cash flows for several months, particularly when equipment upgrades are involved. Thus, major relocations are typically carried out only when the likelihood of higher long term returns heavily outweighs the short term costs. The Middle East has been a primary focus among our international operations in recent years. As of February 24, 2012, industry utilization in the Middle East for jack up rigs was 82%. At February 27, 2012, we had eight rigs under contract in Saudi Arabia and one rig under contract in Qatar. One of our eleven rigs there had a contract expiring in 2012, eight had contracts expiring in 2014 and two were idle. 22 Table of Contents The North Sea is a mature, harsh environment offshore drilling market that has long been dominated by major oil and gas companies operating within a relatively tight regulatory environment. Project lead times are often lengthy, and drilling assignments, which typically require ultra premium equipment capable of handling extreme weather conditions and high down hole pressures and temperatures, can range from several months to several years. Thus, drilling activity and day rates in the North Sea move slowly in response to market conditions, and generally follow trends in oil prices. As of February 24, 2012, industry utilization for jack up rigs in the North Sea was 93%, and at February 2, 2012, we had six rigs there with expected contract completion dates ranging from 2012 through 2016. As of February 27, 2012, our remaining rigs outside the U.S. were the Rowan Gorilla II, which was operating in Malaysia under a contract that is expected to conclude in the fourth quarter of 2012; the Rowan Gorilla III and Rowan EXL II, which were operating in Trinidad under contracts expected to complete in November 2012 and February 2014, respectively; and the J.P. Bussell, which was operating in Vietnam under contract through approximately October 2012. 23 Table of Contents Key Performance Measures The following table presents certain key performance measures for our fleet: 2011 2010 2009 Revenues (in thousands): North Sea $ 298,027 $ 176,265 $ 171,630 Middle East 263,589 283,512 371,661 Gulf of Mexico 260,405 283,308 288,705 Other international 105,924 256,832 196,782 Subtotal Day rate revenues 927,945 999,917 1,028,778 Other revenues(1) 11,284 17,788 14,225 Total $ 939,229 $ 1,017,705 $ 1,043,003 Revenue producing days: North Sea 1,424 776 705 Middle East 2,048 2,012 2,424 Gulf of Mexico 2,227 2,121 1,983 Other international 832 1,253 764 Total 6,531 6,162 5,876 Average day rate:(2) North Sea $ 209,289 $ 227,146 $ 243,447 Middle East $ 128,706 $ 140,911 $ 153,325 Gulf of Mexico $ 116,931 $ 133,573 $ 145,590 Other international $ 127,313 $ 204,974 $ 257,568 Total $ 142,083 $ 162,272 $ 175,081 Utilization (by location):(3) North Sea 94 % 94 % 97 % Middle East 53 % 61 % 74 % Gulf of Mexico 71 % 68 % 64 % Other international 59 % 92 % 83 % Total 66 % 72 % 73 % Utilization (by classification):(3) High specification jack up(4) 83 % 94 % 93 % Premium jack up(5) 49 % 58 % 63 % Conventional jack up 28 % 24 % 38 % (1) Other revenues, which are primarily revenues received for contract reimbursable costs, are excluded from the computation of average day rate. (2) Average day rate is computed by dividing day rate revenues by the number of revenue producing days. (3) Utilization is the number of revenue producing days divided by the aggregate number of days rigs were available to work. (4) We define high specification jack ups as those that have hook load capacity of at least two million pounds. (5) We define premium jack ups as those cantilevered rigs capable of operating in water depths of 300 feet or more. 24 Table of Contents 2011 Compared to 2010 Our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 are highlighted below (dollars in millions): 2011 2010 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 939.2 100 % $ 1,017.7 100 % Operating costs (excluding items below) (508.1 ) 54 % (416.8 ) 41 % Depreciation expense (183.9 ) 20 % (138.3 ) 14 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (88.2 ) 9 % (78.6 ) 8 % Net gain (loss) on property disposals 1.6 0 % (0.4 ) 0 % Material charges and other operating expenses (11.0 ) 1 % (5.3 ) 1 % Operating income $ 149.6 16 % $ 378.3 37 % Revenues for 2011 decreased by $78.5 million or 8% compared to 2010 as a result of the following (in millions): Increase (Decrease) Rig additions $ 234.9 Lower average day rates for existing rigs (159.7 ) Lower utilization of existing rigs (147.2 ) Revenues for reimbursable costs and other, net (6.5 ) Net decrease $ (78.5 ) Newbuild additions to the fleet in 2010 and 2011 contributed 1,267 (or 21%) incremental revenue producing days in 2011 over 2010. During the year, we had nine rigs moving to, or preparing for, new contracts, and several of those projects took longer than anticipated. We estimate that approximately 22% of our available rig days in 2011 were spent by rigs in shipyards or in transit, which contributed to the lower utilization of existing rigs in 2011. The conclusion on long term, higher day rate contracts in 2010 and 2011 contributed to the lower average day rates for existing rigs in 2011. Operating costs other than depreciation, selling, general and administrative expenses and material charges for 2011 increased by $91.3 million or 22% over the prior year, as a result of the following (in millions): Increase (Decrease) Operating costs attributable to fleet additions $ 86.7 Workers compensation 8.8 Lower operating costs for Gorilla VI in the U.K. versus Norway (14.7 ) Lower operating costs due to rigs in shipyard, net (7.4 ) Other, net 17.9 Net increase $ 91.3 Operating margin (revenues in excess of operating costs other than depreciation, selling, general and administrative expenses and material charges and other operating expenses) declined to 46% of revenues in from 59% in 2010 primarily as a result of lower average day rates for and utilization of existing rigs, which more than offset the impact of fleet additions over the periods. Depreciation expense increased by $45.6 million or 33% between periods due to the rig additions. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $9.6 million or 12% due primarily to higher labor costs and tax consulting fees. In 2011, we settled litigation with Textron relating to the loss of the Rowan Halifax in 2005 and charged operations for a payment of $6.1 million (see Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K). Also in 2011, we recognized $4.9 million of incremental noncash and cash compensation cost in connection with the separation of an employee. Such amounts comprise the Material charges and other operating expenses. 25 Table of Contents Material charges and other operating expenses in 2010 consisted of a $5.3 million charge to operations for the expected cost of terminating the Companys agency agreement in Mexico. 2010 Compared to 2009 Our operating results for 2010 and 2009 are highlighted below (dollars in millions): 2010 2009 Amount % of Revenues Amount % of Revenues Revenues $ 1,017.7 100 % $ 1,043.0 100 % Operating costs (excluding items below) (416.8 ) 41 % (404.3 ) 39 % Depreciation expense (138.3 ) 14 % (123.9 ) 12 % Selling, general and administrative expenses (78.6 ) 8 % (66.0 ) 6 % Net gain (loss) on property disposals (0.4 ) 0 % 5.5 1 % Material charges and other operating expenses (5.3 ) 1 % 0 % Operating income $ 378.3 37 % $ 454.3 44 % Revenues for 2010 decreased by $25.3 million or 2% compared to 2009 as a result of the following (in millions): Increase (Decrease) Rig additions $ 82.6 Lower average day rates for existing rigs (62.2 ) Lower utilization of existing rigs (49.2 ) Revenues for reimbursable costs and other, net 3.5 Net decrease $ (25.3 ) Newbuild additions to the fleet contributed 567 (or 10%) incremental revenue producing days in the 2010 over 2009. Operating costs other than depreciation, selling, general and administrative expenses and material charges for 2010 increased by $12.5 million or 3% compared to 2009 primarily due to personnel and related costs attributable to the 2010 additions of the Ralph Coffman and the EXL I. Operating margin (revenues in excess of operating costs other than depreciation, selling, general and administrative expenses and material charges and other operating expenses) declined to 59% of revenues in 2010 from 61% in 2009 primarily as a result of lower average day rates and utilization of existing rigs, which more than offset the impact of fleet additions over the periods. Depreciation increased by $14.4 million or 12% between periods due to the rig additions. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $12.6 million or 19% due primarily to higher labor costs and professional fees. In 2010 we charged $5.3 million to operations for the expected cost of terminating the Companys agency agreement in Mexico. Such amount comprises the Material charges and other operating expenses. Income Taxes Historically, the Company has conducted its foreign operations through its U.S. subsidiaries, which resulted in income tax at the U.S. statutory rate of 35%. In late 2009, the Company began operating many of its foreign based rigs through its international subsidiaries, and has asserted that such earnings are permanently invested abroad. The Company does not provide deferred income taxes on undistributed foreign earnings considered to be permanently invested abroad. The Companys effective tax rate for continuing operations was a benefit of 4.4% in 2011 (on pretax income of $130.1 million) as compared to provisions of 25.6% for 2010 and 26.6% for 2009. The overall benefit in 2011 was primarily attributable to amortization of benefits related to transferring certain rigs into our international subsidiaries over the period from 2009 through 2011 and a greater proportion of income earned in lower tax foreign jurisdictions in 2011 as compared to 2010 and 2009. 26 Table of Contents Outlook Our backlog by geographic area as of February 27, 2012 (the date of our most recent Monthly Fleet Status Report), and for the comparable prior year period is set forth below (in millions): February 27, 2012 February 25, 2011 Norway $ 1,302 $ 135 Middle East 949 621 U.K. 344 473 Trinidad 132 142 U.S. Gulf of Mexico 109 274 Other international 229 14 Total backlog $ 3,065 $ 1,659 We estimate our backlog will be realized as follows (in millions): 2012 $ 935 2013 865 2014 615 2015 383 2016 267 Total backlog $ 3,065 About 60% of our remaining available rig days in 2012 and 42% of available days in 2013 were under contract or commitment as of February 27, 2012. Three of our rigs in the Middle East are expected to enter the shipyard in 2012 for customer required well control equipment upgrades. Additional shipyard time will be incurred by other rigs in 2012 to meet customer or regulatory requirements and receive needed upgrades. We currently expect that approximately 11% of our available rig days in 2012 will be spent by rigs in shipyards or in transit. In each of the past several years, the onset of hurricane season has coincided with declines in drilling activity in the US GOM. We expect this pattern to continue in future years. We believe there are currently 78 jack ups and 68 drillships on order or under construction for completion over the next three and seven years, respectively, most of which do not have drilling contracts in place. Delivery of those rigs is expected to further increase competition among contractors. Thus, we can provide no assurance that we will be able to continue to replace our contract backlog as it is realized, that we can maintain current utilization levels, that day rates will remain above breakeven levels, or that our drilling operations will remain profitable. 27 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Key balance sheet amounts and ratios at December 31 were as follows (dollars in millions): 2011 2010 Cash and cash equivalents $ 438.9 $ 437.5 Current assets (excluding assets of discontinued operations) $ 794.1 $ 767.3 Current liabilities (excluding liabilities of discontinued operations) $ 323.4 $ 266.2 Current ratio (excluding assets and liabilities of discontinued operations) 2.46 2.88 Current maturities of long term debt $ 45.0 $ 52.2 Long term debt, less current maturities $ 1,089.3 $ 1,133.7 Stockholders equity $ 4,326.0 $ 3,752.3 Long term debt/total capitalization 0.20 0.23 Sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents were as follows: 2011 2010 2009 Net operating cash flows $ 94.7 $ 508.2 $ 544.1 Proceeds from sales of manufacturing and land drilling operations, net 1,555.5 Capital expenditures (1,517.7 ) (490.6 ) (566.4 ) Payments to acquire treasury stock (125.0 ) Debt repayments (52.2 ) (594.0 ) (64.9 ) Net change in restricted cash balance 15.3 (15.3 ) Proceeds from equity compensation and debenture plans and other 19.9 8.0 1.5 Proceeds from asset disposals 5.7 3.3 8.6 Borrowings, net of issue costs 395.5 491.7 Net cash used in acquisition of SKDP (17.7 ) All other, net 5.2 0.4 2.7 Total sources (uses) $ 1.4 $ (202.2 ) $ 417.3 Operating Cash Flows Cash flows from operations declined to $94.7 million in 2011 from in excess of $500 million in 2010 and 2009. The decline in cash flows can be attributed in part to the sales of our manufacturing and land drilling businesses in June and September of 2011. As discussed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, as permitted under GAAP, the Company has chosen not to separately disclose cash flows pertaining to discontinued operations in its statement of cash flows. As a result, cash from operations in periods prior to the sale of our manufacturing and land drilling businesses included cash flows of such discontinued operations. Additionally, with respect to our continuing offshore drilling operations, cash flows for 2011 were negatively impacted by downtime due to rigs in shipyards for maintenance and customer required upgrades and rig mobilizations. Further, prior to 2011, cash flows from operations benefited from long term contracts entered into when rates were significantly higher than more recent market rates. Many of these contracts have now been completed. The impact of these contract completions were partially offset in 2011 by the addition of newly constructed rigs to our fleet in 2010 and 2011. We expect the contribution from our newbuild rigs that entered the fleet in 2011 to result in significantly higher operating cash flows for 2012 over 2011 and to approach the levels seen in 2010 and 2009. As Rowans operations have diversified internationally, a greater portion of our revenues has been generated through foreign subsidiaries whose earnings are expected to be permanently invested abroad. As of December 31, 2011, approximately $164 million of the $439 million cash and cash equivalents was held by foreign subsidiaries, and undistributed earnings from foreign subsidiaries amounted to approximately $204 million. Given the growing significance of our foreign subsidiaries and their capital needs relative to our domestic operations, we do not expect this permanent foreign investment to create any liquidity constraints for the foreseeable future. 28 Table of Contents Investing Activities In June and September 2011, we completed the sales of our manufacturing and land drilling businesses and received net cash proceeds before taxes of approximately $1.042 billion and $514 million, respectively. The Company has used and intends to continue to use the proceeds in part for its rig construction program. In May 2011, the Company entered into contracts with Hyundai Heavy Industries Co., Ltd (Hyundai) for the construction of two ultra deepwater drillships, the Rowan Renaissance and Rowan Resolute, at its Ulsan, South Korea, shipyard for delivery in late 2013 and mid 2014, respectively. On October 31, 2011, the Company exercised its option with Hyundai for the construction of an additional ultra deepwater drillship, the Rowan Reliance, of the same specifications as the two drillships currently under construction. The agreement with Hyundai also includes an option exercisable through March 30, 2012, for an additional drillship of the same specifications for delivery in the first quarter of 2015. Construction cost of the three drillships is expected to be funded from available cash, cash flows from operations and short term borrowings. See Note 7 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for the status of costs of rigs under construction. Capital expenditures for 2011 included the following: $539 million towards completion of our two N Class rigs, the Rowan Stavanger and Rowan Norway; $456 million towards construction of the Rowan Renaissance, Rowan Resolute and Rowan Reliance; $89 million towards completion of the 240C class rig, Joe Douglas; $94 million towards completion of the EXL IV; $296 million for improvements to the existing fleet, including contractually required modifications, and $44 million for manufacturing, drilling equipment spares, drill pipe and other. Our 2012 capital budget, as approved by our Board of Directors, is approximately $533 million, and includes $142 million towards construction of the Rowan Renaissance, Rowan Resolute and Rowan Reliance, $210 million for upgrades to existing rigs and shorebase facilities and spare drilling equipment, $175 million pursuant to contractual requirements that will be partially reimbursed by customers, and $6 million for other items. The capital budget reflects an appropriation of money that we may or may not spend, and the timing of such expenditures may change. We will periodically review and adjust the capital budget as necessary based upon current and forecasted cash flows and liquidity, anticipated market conditions in our business, the availability of financing sources, and alternative uses of capital to enhance shareholder value. Certain such adjustments would require Board approval. Financing Activities On August 8, 2011, we announced that our board of directors approved a program to repurchase up to $100 million of our common stock. On November 1, 2011, we announced that our board of directors increased the amount authorized for repurchase from $100 million to $150 million. As of December 31, 2011, we had repurchased 3.9 million shares in the open market at a cost of approximately $125.0 million. Additional purchases under the program may be made through the open market or in privately negotiated transactions and may be commenced or suspended from time to time without notice. Effective June 30, 2011, we amended and restated our credit agreement dated September 16, 2010. Under the new agreement (the 2011 Credit Agreement), we may borrow up to $500 million on a revolving basis through June 30, 2016. Interest and commitment fees payable under the 2011 Credit Agreement are based in part on the Companys then current credit ratings. The annual commitment fee is currently 0.25% of the unused commitment, and advances would currently bear interest at Libor plus 1.75% per annum. There were no amounts drawn under the 2011 Credit Agreement at December 31, 2011. The 2011 Credit Agreement limits total consolidated indebtedness and contains events of default, the occurrence of which may trigger an acceleration of amounts outstanding under the agreement. We were in compliance with each of our debt covenants at December 31, 2011, and we expect to remain in compliance in 2012. Based on current and anticipated near term operating levels, we believe that operating cash flows together with existing cash, and cash equivalents and amounts available under our bank credit facility will be adequate to fund capital expenditures, debt service and other anticipated cash requirements in 2012. 29 Table of Contents Cash Dividends We last paid a regular quarterly cash dividend in 2008. At December 31, 2011, we had approximately $429 million available for distribution to stockholders under provisions of our debt agreements. Future dividends, if any, will only be paid at the discretion of the Board of Directors. There are no current plans to pay dividends. Off balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations The Company had no off balance sheet arrangements as of December 31, 2011 or 2010, other than operating lease obligations and other commitments in the ordinary course of business. The following is a summary of our contractual obligations at December 31, 2011, including obligations recognized on our balance sheet and those not required to be recognized on our balance sheet (in millions): Payments due by period Total Within 1 year 2 to 3 years 4 to 5 years After 5 years Long term debt, including interest $ 1,614 $ 113 $ 192 $ 174 $ 1,135 Newbuild construction contracts 1,766 142 1,624 Purchase obligations, excluding newbuilds 134 134 Operating leases 20 3 5 4 8 Total $ 3,534 $ 392 $ 1,821 $ 178 $ 1,143 We periodically employ letters of credit or other bank issued guarantees in the normal course of our businesses, and had outstanding letters of credit of approximately $43.0 million at December 31, 2011. Pension Obligations Minimum contributions under defined benefit pension plans are determined based upon actuarial calculations of pension assets and liabilities that involve, among other things, assumptions about long term asset returns and interest rates. Similar calculations were used to estimate pension costs and obligations as reflected in our consolidated financial statements (see Critical Accounting Policies and Management Estimates Pension and other postretirement benefits). As of December 31, 2011, our financial statements reflected an aggregate unfunded pension liability of $242 million. We expect to make minimum contributions to our defined benefit pension plans of approximately $51 million in 2012, and we will continue to make significant pension contributions over the next several years. Additional funding may be required if pension asset values decline. Contingent Liabilities Rowan is involved in various legal proceedings incidental to its businesses and is vigorously defending its position in all such matters. The Company believes that there are no known contingencies, claims or lawsuits that could have a material effect on its financial position, results of operations or cash flows. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND MANAGEMENT ESTIMATES Rowans significant accounting policies are presented in Note 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. These policies and management judgments, assumptions and estimates made in their application underlie reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. We believe that our most critical accounting policies and management estimates involve carrying values of long lived assets, pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs (specifically assumptions used in actuarial calculations), and income taxes (particularly our estimated reserves for uncertain tax positions), as changes in such policies and or estimates would produce significantly different amounts from those reported herein. Impairment of long lived assets We evaluate the carrying value of our property and equipment, primarily our drilling rigs, when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such rigs may not be recoverable. Generally, extended periods of idle time and or our inability to contract rigs at economical rates are an indication that a rig may be impaired. However, the offshore drilling industry has historically been highly cyclical and it is not unusual for rigs to be unutilized or underutilized for extended periods of time and subsequently resume full or near full utilization when business cycles improve. Likewise, during periods of excess supply, rigs may be contracted at or near cash break even rates for extended periods. Impairment situations may arise with respect to specific individual rigs, groups of rigs, such as a specific type of drilling rig, or rigs in a certain geographic region. Our rigs are mobile and may generally be moved from regions with excess supply, if economically feasible. 30 Table of Contents Asset impairment evaluations are, by nature, highly subjective. In most instances, they involve expectations of future cash flows to be generated by our drilling rigs and are based on managements judgments and assumptions regarding future industry conditions and operations, as well as managements estimates of future expected utilization, contract rates, expense levels and capital requirements of our drilling rigs. The estimates, judgments and assumptions used by management in the application of our asset impairment policies reflect both historical experience and an assessment of current operational, industry, market, economic and political environments. The use of different estimates, judgments, assumptions and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations would likely result in materially different asset carrying values and operating results. Pension and other postretirement benefits Our pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities and costs are based upon actuarial computations that reflect our assumptions about future events, including long term asset returns, interest rates, annual compensation increases, mortality rates and other factors. Key assumptions at December 31, 2011, included discount rates ranging from 4.40% to 4.59%, an expected long term rate of return on pension plan assets of 8% and annual healthcare cost increases ranging from 8.4% in 2012 to 4.5% in 2029 and beyond. The assumed discount rate is based upon the average yield for Moodys Aa rated corporate bonds and the rate of return assumption reflects a probability distribution of expected long term returns that is weighted based upon plan asset allocations. A one percentage point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase our recorded pension and other postretirement benefit liabilities by approximately $112 million, while a one percentage point change in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would change annual net benefits cost by approximately $4.3 million. A one percentage point increase in the assumed healthcare cost trend rate would increase 2012 other postretirement benefit cost by $0.5 million. To develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption, Rowan considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments (primarily government bonds), the historical level of the risk premium associated with the plans other asset classes and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based upon the current asset allocation to develop the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption for the plan, which was maintained at 8% at December 31, 2011, unchanged from December 31, 2010. Income taxes In accordance with accounting guidelines for income tax uncertainties, we evaluate each tax position to determine if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on its merits. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in income for the period, and a reserve, if any. Our income tax returns are subject to audit by U.S. federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. Determinations by such taxing authorities that differ materially from our recorded estimates, either favorably or unfavorably, may have a material impact on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We believe our reserve for uncertain tax positions totaling $55.3 million at December 31, 2011, is properly recorded in accordance with the accounting guidelines. New Accounting Standards In June 2011, the FASB issued an update on the presentation of other comprehensive income. Under this update, entities will be required to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. The current option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity has been eliminated. This update is effective for interim and annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2011. We do not believe the adoption of this update will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. 31 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISKS Rowans outstanding debt at December 31, 2011, consisted entirely of fixed rate debt with a carrying value of $1.134 billion and a weighted average annual interest rate of 6.0%. Due to the fixed rate nature of the Companys debt, management believes the risk of loss due to changes in market interest rates is not material. The majority of Rowans transactions are denominated in United States dollars. The Company has some exposure to currency exchange fluctuations primarily in the U.K. In order to reduce the impact of exchange rate fluctuations, Rowan generally requires customer payments to be in U.S. dollars and generally limits foreign currency holdings to the extent they are needed to pay liabilities denominated in local currencies. Fluctuating commodity prices affect Rowans future earnings materially to the extent that they influence demand for the Companys products and services. As a general practice, Rowan does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments.
