Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Introduction General The following discussion and financial information is presented to aid in understanding Regions Financial Corporations (Regions or the Company) financial position and results of operations. The emphasis of this discussion will be on the years 2002, 2003 and 2004; in addition, financial information for prior years will also be presented when appropriate. Certain amounts in prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. On July 1, 2004, Regions merged with Union Planters Corporation (Union Planters) headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. The combination with Union Planters added approximately $35.7 billion of assets, $22.3 billion of loans, and $22.9 billion of deposits. This transaction was accounted for as a purchase of Union Planters by Regions and accordingly prior period financial statements have not been restated, except certain share and per share amounts related to the exchange of Regions common stock. Union Planters results of operations were included in Regions results beginning July 1, 2004. Comparisons with prior periods are significantly impacted by the merger with Union Planters (see Note 18 Business Combinations to the consolidated financial statements). Regions primary business is providing traditional commercial and retail banking services to customers throughout its geographic footprint. Regions banking subsidiaries, Regions Bank and Union Planters Bank, National Association (UPBNA), have operations in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. In 2004, Regions banking operations, excluding trust activities, contributed approximately $723 million to consolidated net income. In addition to providing traditional commercial and retail banking services, Regions provides other financial services in the fields of investment banking, asset management, trust, mutual funds, securities brokerage, mortgage banking, insurance, leasing and other specialty financing. Regions provides investment banking and brokerage services through 244 offices of Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc. (Morgan Keegan). Morgan Keegan contributed approximately $83.6 million to net income in 2004, including trust activities. Regions Morgan Keegan Trust, FSB, a federal savings bank subsidiary of Morgan Keegan, acts as fiduciary for certain Morgan Keegan trust clients and does not accept retail insured deposits. Regions mortgage banking divisions, Regions Mortgage and EquiFirst Corporation (EquiFirst), provide residential mortgage loan origination and servicing activities for customers and contributed $55.1 million to net income in 2004. Regions Mortgage services approximately $39.4 billion in mortgage loans as of December 31, 2004. Regions provides full line insurance brokerage services primarily through Rebsamen Insurance, Inc., one of the 50 largest insurance brokers in the country. Credit life insurance services for customers are provided through other Regions affiliates. Insurance activities contributed approximately $14.2 million to net income in 2004. Regions profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income and non interest income sources. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income Regions receives on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense Regions pays on interest bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its liabilities. Non interest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts, trust and securities brokerage activities, mortgage origination and servicing, insurance and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses and non interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and other operating expenses, including income taxes. Economic conditions, competition and the monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal government in general, significantly affect financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by the level of business spending and investment, consumer income, spending and savings, capital market activities, competition among financial institutions, customer prefer 17 Table of Contents ences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in Regions primary market areas. Regions business strategy has been and continues to be focused on providing a competitive mix of products and services, delivering quality customer service and maintaining a branch distribution network with offices in convenient locations. Regions believes that its merger with Union Planters will be beneficial in the continued implementation of this strategy. The Companys principal market areas are located in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. Morgan Keegan also operates offices in New York, Massachusetts and Virginia as well as Toronto, Canada. 2004 Highlights Regions most significant accomplishment in 2004 was the successful completion of the merger with Union Planters. This transaction dramatically increased Regions customer base and geographic footprint resulting in a stronger, better positioned franchise. The combination with Union Planters resulted in improved market share in attractive markets including Texas, Florida and Tennessee. Considering aggregate deposits, in the six core states (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Tennessee) of the franchise, Regions has the 2nd largest overall deposit market share. Regions reported net income available to common shareholders of $2.19 per diluted share in 2004, including a reduction of $.10 per diluted share related to $39 million (net of tax) in merger related expenses. Net income available to common shareholders was $2.35 per diluted share in 2003. Net interest income for 2004 was $2.1 billion, compared to $1.5 billion in 2003. The net interest margin for 2004 was 3.66%, up from 3.49% in 2003. The increase in the net interest margin was due in part to a shift in the mix of earning assets. Loans, typically Regions highest yielding asset, increased as a percentage of total earning assets. Reduced balance sheet leverage contributed to the shift in mix of earning assets as certain maturities from the securities portfolio were not reinvested but rather were used to reduce borrowings. In addition, the benefit resulting from the early retirement of Federal Home Loan Bank advances in the second quarter of 2004 also contributed to a higher net interest margin. As of December 31, 2004, interest rate sensitivity analysis indicated Regions balance sheet remains in a slightly asset sensitive position, which should be beneficial in a rising rate environment. Regions banking unit showed positive signs in 2004. Excluding the effect of the Union Planters merger, loans increased 8% due to increases in commercial real estate lending and consumer lines of credit. Deposits increased 9%, excluding the effect of the merger with Union Planters, due primarily to growth in interest free and money market deposits. Net charge offs totaled $131.0 million or 0.29% of average loans in 2004, compared to 0.33% in 2003. Non performing assets including loans past due 90 days increased $188.4 million to $527.0 million at December 31, 2004 but declined as a percentage of total loans and other real estate compared to year end 2003. In 2004, Regions successfully completed the integration of the credit policy functions of Regions and Union Planters. Non interest income totaled 42% of total revenue in 2004, as Regions continues to benefit from a diversified revenue steam. Brokerage and investment revenues declined slightly in 2004 as a slow down from record levels of fixed income production in prior years was not completely offset by improved private client revenues related to improved equity markets and two closed end fund offerings. Equity capital markets and investment advisory fees were also higher in 2004. Residential mortgage servicing and origination fees were higher in 2004, due to business activity added in connection with the Union Planters merger. The mortgage industry continues to face a number of market challenges. Regions continues to evaluate its mortgage division for the optimal business mix as well as improved operating efficiencies. 18 Table of Contents Non interest expense totaled $2.5 billion in 2004 compared to $1.8 billion in 2003. Included in 2004 are merger related charges of $55.1 million. In connection with the integration of Regions and Union Planters, Regions has and will continue to incur merger related expenses throughout the integration process. As the integration of Regions and Union Planters progresses, Regions expects to realize merger efficiencies in the banking units as well as other lines of business. Regions intends to continue to invest in many areas of the franchise, including personnel, technology and product delivery channels in order to increase revenue and improve efficiencies while continuing to provide superior customer service. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing financial information, management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses for the periods shown. The accounting principles followed by Regions and the methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and general banking practices. Estimates and assumptions most significant to Regions are related primarily to allowance for loan losses, intangibles (excess purchase price, other identifiable intangible assets and mortgage serving rights) and income taxes, and are summarized in the following discussion and notes to the consolidated financial statements. Managements determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, which is based on the factors and risk identification procedures discussed in the following pages, requires the use of judgments and estimates that may change in the future. Changes in the factors used by management to determine the adequacy of the allowance, or the availability of new information, could cause the allowance for loan losses to be increased or decreased in future periods. In addition, bank regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, may require that additions be made to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments and estimates. Regions excess purchase price (the amount in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired) is tested for impairment annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist. Adverse changes in the economic environment, operations of acquired business units, or other factors could result in a decline in implied fair value of excess purchase price. If the implied fair value is less than the carrying amount, a loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to implied fair value. Other identifiable intangible assets, primarily core deposits intangibles, are reviewed at least annually for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset, such as loss of core deposits, increased competition or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable, an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount to the fair value. For purposes of evaluating mortgage servicing impairment, Regions must estimate the value of its mortgage servicing rights (MSR). MSR do not trade in an active market with readily observable market prices. Although sales of MSR do occur, the exact terms and conditions of sales may not be readily available. As a result, Regions stratifies its mortgage servicing portfolio on the basis of certain risk characteristics, including loan type and contractual note rate, and values its MSR using discounted cash flow modeling techniques which require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration historical and forecasted mortgage loan prepayment rates and discount rates. Changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other factors could result in impairment of the servicing asset and a charge against earnings to reduce the recorded carrying amount. Based on a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, Regions estimates that a reduction in the primary mortgage market rates of 25 basis points and 50 points would reduce the December 31, 2004 fair value of MSR by 14% ($56 million) and 30% ($111 million), respectively. Management mitigates risk associated with declines in the estimated value of MSR by purchasing agency securities to create economic hedges. 19 Table of Contents Managements determination of the realization of the deferred tax asset is based upon managements judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income earned by certain subsidiaries and the implementation of various tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset. Management believes that the subsidiaries will generate sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax benefits. Regions 1998 to 2003 consolidated federal income tax returns are open for examination. From time to time Regions engages in business plans that may also have an effect on its tax liabilities. While Regions has obtained the opinion of advisors that the tax aspects of these plans should prevail, examination of Regions income tax returns or changes in tax law may impact these plans and resulting provisions for income taxes. Acquisitions The acquisitions of banks and other financial service companies historically have contributed significantly to Regions growth. The acquisitions of other financial service companies have also allowed Regions to better diversify its revenue stream and to offer additional products and services to its customers. Regions, from time to time, evaluates potential bank and non bank acquisition candidates; however, no transactions were pending at December 31, 2004. On July 1, 2004, Regions completed its merger with Union Planters Corporation, headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. Union Planters provided traditional commercial and retail banking services and other financial services in the fields of mortgage banking, insurance, trust, securities brokerage and investments, professional employment services and specialty financing. Union Planters banking subsidiary, UPBNA, serves customers through over 700 branches covering the midsouth. The combination with Union Planters, while adding $35.7 billion in assets, $22.3 billion in loans and $22.9 billion in deposits, significantly expanded Regions geographic footprint as well as its customer base. Through the merger, Regions expanded its banking presence into new markets in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi and Missouri and strengthened its banking presence in existing markets in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas. Additionally in 2004, Regions acquired Evergreen Timber Investment Management (ETIM). ETIM manages timber assets for third parties and produces annual revenue of approximately $10 million. In 2003, Regions consummated the purchase of three branches from Inter Savings Bank, FSB, which strengthened its community banking franchise in central Florida. These branches combined added $185 million in assets, $5 million in loans and $185 million in deposits: In 2002, Regions consummated two acquisitions, which strengthened its community banking franchise in Texas while adding an insurance firm headquartered in New Iberia, Louisiana. These acquisitions combined added $280 million in assets, $156 million in loans and $253 million in deposits: Regions expanded its insurance division though the acquisition of ICT Group, LLC, headquartered in New Iberia, Louisiana. Regions expanded into the Dallas, Texas, market through the acquisition of Brookhollow Bancshares, Inc., with $167 million in assets. Regions expanded its presence in the Houston, Texas, market through the acquisition of Independence Bank, National Association, with $112 million in assets. 20 Table of Contents Regions business combinations over the last three years are summarized in the following charts. Each of these transactions was accounted for as a purchase.

Dallas, Texas 166,916 May Independence Bank, National Association Houston, Texas 112,408 Financial Condition Regions financial condition depends primarily on the quality and nature of its assets, liabilities and capital structure, the market and economic conditions, and the quality of its personnel. Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses Loan Portfolio Regions primary investment is loans. At December 31, 2004, loans represented 78% of Regions earning assets. Lending at Regions is generally organized along three functional lines: commercial loans (including financial and agricultural), real estate loans and consumer loans. The composition of the portfolio by these major categories is presented below (with real estate loans further broken down between construction and mortgage loans): December 31, 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 (in thousands, net of unearned income) Commercial $ 15,028,015 $ 9,754,588 $ 10,667,855 $ 9,727,204 $ 9,039,818 Real estate construction 5,472,463 3,484,767 3,604,116 3,664,677 3,271,692 Real estate mortgage 27,639,913 12,977,549 11,039,552 11,309,126 13,114,655 Consumer 9,386,563 5,967,419 5,674,251 6,184,341 5,950,298 Total $ 57,526,954 $ 32,184,323 $ 30,985,774 $ 30,885,348 $ 31,376,463 As the above table demonstrates, over the last five years loans increased a total of $26.2 billion, a compound growth rate of 16%. In 2001, loan balances declined $491 million due primarily to increased prepayments of residential mortgage loans. In 2002, total loans increased $100 million primarily due to growth in the commercial portfolio, partially offset by the reclassification of $1.1 billion of indirect auto loans to the loans held for sale category on September 30, 2002. Excluding the effect of the reclassification, total loans would have increased $1.2 billion, or 4%, in 2002. Loans increased $1.2 billion or 4% in 2003, due primarily to growth in the real estate portfolio partially offset by a decline in the commercial portfolio. Loans increased significantly in 2004 due to $22.3 billion of loans which were added by the Union Planters merger, $430 million of indirect auto loans reclassified to the loan portfolio from the loans held for sale category and internally generated loan growth. Excluding loans added from the merger and reclassification, loans increased 8% in 2004. 21 Table of Contents Loans added in connection with the Union Planters merger are summarized in the following table. (in thousands) Commercial $ 5,745,594 Real estate construction 2,419,306 Real estate mortgage 10,054,804 Consumer 4,078,523 Total $ 22,298,227 All major categories in the loan portfolio have increased significantly over the last five years due primarily to the merger with Union Planters. Over the last five years, commercial, financial and agricultural loans increased $6.0 billion, or 66%. Real estate construction loans increased $2.2 billion, or 67%, over the same period. Real estate mortgage loans increased $14.5 billion, or 111%, and consumer loans increased $3.4 billion, or 58%, over the last five years. In 2004, as economic factors improved, internally generated loan growth increased, primarily in the real estate and consumer categories. Average total loans were $30.9 billion in 2002, compared to $31.5 billion in 2003 and $44.7 billion in 2004. The modest internal loan growth trend experienced in prior years was a result of lower loan demand resulting from weaker economic conditions, significant prepayments of mortgage loans, management initiatives to focus on higher margin loans, combined with the reclassification of indirect auto loans in 2002. Regions expects modest loan growth in 2005. Regions residential real estate mortgage portfolio totaled $8.7 billion at December 31, 2004, an increase of approximately $3.1 billion from a year earlier. Mortgages added in connection with the Union Planters merger accounted for most of the increase. The portfolio contained approximately $5.4 billion of adjustable rate mortgages (ARM) and $3.3 billion of fixed rate mortgages at year end. The fixed rate residential mortgage portfolios weighted average coupon increased to 5.90% from 5.73% the previous year, while the weighted average remaining maturity decreased slightly to 170 months from 172 months. The residential ARM portfolio also exhibited a yield increase with rates averaging 5.37% in 2004 compared to 5.10% a year earlier. At December 31, 2004, the weighted average months to reprice was 35, up from 31 months at year end 2003. The amounts of total gross loans (excluding residential mortgages and consumer loans) outstanding at December 31, 2004, based on remaining scheduled repayments of principal, due in (1) one year or less, (2) more than one year but less than five years and (3) more than five years, are shown in the following table. The amounts due after one year are classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Loans Maturing Within After One But After One Year Within Five Years Five Years Total (in thousands) Commercial, financial and agricultural $ 7,641,567 $ 5,640,946 $ 1,897,109 $ 15,179,622 Real estate construction 3,417,148 1,807,188 263,698 5,488,034 Real estate mortgage 3,062,550 7,756,202 3,325,679 14,144,431 Total $ 14,121,265 $ 15,204,336 $ 5,486,486 $ 34,812,087 Sensitivity of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates Predetermined Variable Rate Rate (in thousands) Due after one year but within five years $ 4,531,348 $ 10,672,988 Due after five years 1,633,043 3,853,443 Total $ 6,164,391 $ 14,526,431 22 Table of Contents A sound credit policy and careful, consistent credit review are vital to a successful lending program. All affiliates of Regions operate under written loan policies that attempt to maintain a consistent lending philosophy, provide sound traditional credit decisions, provide an adequate risk adjusted return and render service to the communities in which the banks are located. Regions lending policy generally confines loans to local customers or to national firms doing business locally. Credit reviews and loan examinations help confirm that affiliates are adhering to these loan policies. Allowance for Loan Losses Every loan carries some degree of credit risk. This risk is reflected in the consolidated financial statements by the allowance for loan losses, the amount of loans charged off and the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense. It is Regions policy that when a loss is identified, it is charged against the allowance for loan losses in the current period. The policy regarding recognition of losses requires immediate recognition of a loss if significant doubt exists as to principal repayment. Regions provision for loan losses is a reflection of actual losses experienced during the year and managements judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Some of the factors considered by management in determining the amount of the provision and resulting allowance include: (1) detailed reviews of individual loans; (2) gross and net loan charge offs in the current year; (3) the current level of the allowance in relation to total loans and to historical loss levels; (4) past due and non accruing loans; (5) collateral values of properties securing loans; (6) the composition of the loan portfolio (types of loans) and risk profiles; and (7) managements analysis of economic conditions and the resulting impact on Regions loan portfolio. A coordinated effort is undertaken to identify credit losses in the loan portfolio for management purposes and to establish the loan loss provision and resulting allowance for accounting purposes. A regular, formal and ongoing loan review is conducted to identify loans with unusual risks or possible losses. The primary responsibility for this review rests with the management of the individual banking offices. Their work is supplemented with reviews by Regions internal audit staff and corporate loan examiners. This process provides information that helps in assessing the quality of the portfolio, assists in the prompt identification of problems and potential problems, and aids in deciding if a loan represents a probable loss that should be recognized or a risk for which an allowance should be maintained. If it is determined that payment of interest on a loan is questionable, it is Regions policy to classify the loan as non accrual and reverse interest previously accrued on the loan against interest income. Interest on such loans is thereafter recorded on a cash basis and is included in earnings only when actually received in cash and when full payment of principal is no longer doubtful. Although it is Regions policy to immediately charge off as a loss all loan amounts judged to be uncollectible, historical experience indicates that certain losses exist in the loan portfolio that have not been specifically identified. To anticipate and provide for these unidentifiable losses, the allowance for loan losses is established by charging the provision for loan losses expense against current earnings. No portion of the resulting allowance is in any way allocated or restricted to any individual loan or group of loans. The entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any and all loans. Regions determines its allowance for loan losses in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114 (Statement 114) and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5 (Statement 5). In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, management uses information from its ongoing loan review process to stratify the loan portfolio into risk grades. The higher risk graded loans in the portfolio are assigned estimated amounts of loss based on several factors, including current and historical loss experience of each higher risk category, regulatory guidelines for losses in each higher risk category and managements judgment of economic conditions and the resulting impact on the higher risk graded loans. All loans deemed to be impaired, which include all non accrual loans greater than $1 million, excluding loans to individuals, are evaluated individually. Impaired loans totaled approximately $95 million at December 31, 2004 and $94 million at December 31, 2003. The vast majority of Regions impaired loans are dependent upon collateral for repayment. For these loans, impairment is measured by evaluating collateral value as compared 23 Table of Contents to the current investment in the loan. For all other loans, Regions compares the amount of estimated discounted cash flows to the investment in the loan. In the event a particular loans collateral value or discounted cash flows are not sufficient to support the collection of the investment in the loan, the loan is specifically considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses or a charge is immediately taken against the allowance for loan losses. The amount of the allowance for loan losses related to the higher risk loans was approximately 55% at December 31, 2004, compared to approximately 69% at December 31, 2003. Higher risk loans, which include impaired loans, consist of loans classified as OLEM (other loans especially mentioned) and below and loans in other loan categories that are significantly past due. In addition to establishing allowance levels for specifically identified higher risk graded loans, management determines allowance levels for all other loans in the portfolio for which historical experience indicates that losses exist. These loans are categorized by loan type and assigned estimated amounts of loss based on several factors, including current and historical loss experience of each loan type and managements judgment of economic conditions and the resulting impact on each category of loans. The amount of the allowance for loan losses related to all other loans in the portfolio for which historical experience indicates that losses exist was approximately 45% of Regions allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2004, compared to approximately 31% at December 31, 2003. The amount of the allowance related to these loans is combined with the amount of the allowance related to the higher risk graded loans to evaluate the overall level of the allowance for loan losses. As a part of the integration of Regions and Union Planters, the loan review, grading and rating systems were combined throughout the combined organization. The result is a consistent approach of review and rating for loans originated from both organizations. Over the last five years, the year end allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans ranged from a low of 1.20% at December 31, 2000 to a high of 1.41% at December 31, 2003 and 2002. As of December 31, 2004, the allowance as a percentage of loans was 1.31%. Management considers the current level of the allowance for loan losses adequate to absorb probable losses from loans in the portfolio. Managements determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, which is based on the factors and risk identification procedures previously discussed, requires the use of judgments and estimations that may change in the future. Changes in the factors used by management to determine the adequacy of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance for loan losses to be increased or decreased in future periods. In addition, bank regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, may require that additions be made to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments and estimates. 24 Table of Contents The following table presents information on non performing loans and real estate acquired in settlement of loans: December 31, Non Performing Assets 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 (dollar amounts in thousands) Non performing loans: Loans accounted for on a non accrual basis $ 388,379 $ 250,344 $ 226,470 $ 269,764 $ 197,974 Loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments (exclusive of non accrual loans) 74,777 35,187 38,499 46,845 35,903 Loans whose terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower (exclusive of non accrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more) 279 886 32,280 42,807 12,372 Real estate acquired in settlement of loans (other real estate) 63,598 52,195 59,606 40,872 28,443 Total $ 527,033 $ 338,612 $ 356,855 $ 400,288 $ 274,692 Non performing assets as a percentage of loans and other real estate .92 % 1.05 % 1.15 % 1.29 % .87 % The analysis of loan loss experience, as reflected in the following table, shows that net loan losses over the last five years ranged from a high of $131.0 million in 2004 to a low of $94.1 million in 2000. Net loan losses were $104.6 million in 2003, $111.8 million in 2002, and $126.8 million in 2001. Over the last five years, net loan losses averaged 0.34% of average loans and were 0.29% of average loans in 2004. Compared to the prior year, in 2004, Regions experienced a lower charge off percentage for commercial credits, partially offset by higher levels of losses in the consumer category. 25 Table of Contents The following analysis presents a five year history of the allowance for loan losses and loan loss data: December 31, 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 (dollar amounts in thousands) Allowance for loan losses: Balance at beginning of year $ 454,057 $ 437,164 $ 419,167 $ 376,508 $ 338,375 Loans charged off: Commercial 105,855 89,250 83,562 95,584 51,617 Real estate 31,453 18,953 16,731 11,705 13,673 Consumer 51,064 36,666 56,010 61,760 66,456 Total 188,372 144,869 156,303 169,049 131,746 Recoveries: Commercial 28,088 13,501 14,892 11,138 15,639 Real estate 6,673 5,798 5,031 5,027 2,750 Consumer 22,631 20,963 24,549 26,043 19,249 Total 57,392 40,262 44,472 42,208 37,638 Net loans charged off: Commercial 77,767 75,749 68,670 84,446 35,978 Real estate 24,780 13,155 11,700 6,678 10,923 Consumer 28,433 15,703 31,461 35,717 47,207 Total 130,980 104,607 111,831 126,841 94,108 Allowance of acquired banks 303,144 0 2,328 4,098 5,142 Provision charged to expense 128,500 121,500 127,500 165,402 127,099 Balance at end of year $ 754,721 $ 454,057 $ 437,164 $ 419,167 $ 376,508 Average loans outstanding: Commercial $ 12,766,378 $ 10,647,432 $ 10,329,482 $ 9,567,538 $ 8,811,864 Real estate 24,020,589 15,385,221 14,571,345 15,598,488 15,595,695 Consumer 7,880,505 5,422,520 5,970,266 5,780,710 5,723,249 Total $ 44,667,472 $ 31,455,173 $ 30,871,093 $ 30,946,736 $ 30,130,808 Net charge offs as percent of average loans outstanding: Commercial .61 % .71 % .66 % .88 % .41 % Real estate .10 .09 .08 .04 .07 Consumer .36 .29 .53 .62 .82 Total .29 % .33 % .36 % .41 % .31 % Net charge offs as percent of: Provision for loan losses 101.9 % 86.1 % 87.7 % 76.7 % 74.0 % Allowance for loan losses 17.4 23.0 25.6 30.3 25.0 Allowance as percentage of loans, net of unearned income 1.31 % 1.41 % 1.41 % 1.36 % 1.20 % Provision for loan losses (net of tax effect) as percentage of net income 11.0 % 13.3 % 14.7 % 20.3 % 15.1 % Risk Characteristics of Loan Portfolio In order to assess the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio, it is appropriate to consider the economy of Regions primary banking markets as well as the three major categories of loans commercial, real estate and consumer. 26 Table of Contents Economy of Regions primary banking markets. The Alabama economy has experienced relatively stable growth over the last several years. Industries important in the Alabama economy include vehicle and vehicle parts manufacturing and assembly, lumber and wood products, health care services, and steel production. High technology and defense related industries are important in the northern part of the state. Agriculture, particularly poultry, beef cattle and cotton, are also important to the states economy. Tennessees economy is heavily influenced by automobile manufacturing, tourism, entertainment and recreation, health care and other service industries. With one out of four Tennesseeans employed in service industries, the states economy is dependent on this sector. The economy of northern Georgia, where the majority of Regions Georgia franchise is located, is diversified with a strong presence in poultry production, carpet manufacturing, automotive manufacturing related industries, tourism, and various service sector industries. A well developed transportation system has contributed to the growth in north Georgia. This area has experienced rapid population growth and has favorable household income characteristics relative to many of Regions other markets. In the southern region of Georgia, while agriculture is important, other industries play a significant role in the economy as well. Georgia ranks as one of the nations top producers of paper and paper board products. Albany and Valdosta, Regions primary market areas in southern Georgia, are hubs for retail trade and health care for the entire South Georgia market. These markets are also home to numerous manufacturing and production facilities of Fortune 500 Companies. Florida has also experienced excellent economic growth during the last several years. Tourism and space research are very important to the Florida economy, and military payrolls are significant in the panhandle area. Florida has experienced strong in migration, contributing to strong construction activity and a growing retirement age population. Citrus fruit production is also important in the state. The Arkansas economy is supported in part by the forest products industry, due to the abundance of corporate owned forests and public forest lands. In recent years, retail trade, transportation and steel production have become increasingly important to the states economy. Natural resources are very important to the Louisiana economy. Energy and petrochemical industries play a significant role in the economy. Shipping, shipbuilding, and other transportation equipment industries are strong in the states durable goods industries. Tourism, amusement and recreation, service, and health care industries are also important to the Louisiana economy. Cotton, rice and sugarcane are among Louisianas most important agricultural commodities, while Louisianas fishing industry is one of the largest in the nation. The economy in the state of Texas has been among the strongest in the nation in recent years. In addition to oil, gas and agriculture, the Texas economy is supported by telecommunications, computer and technology research, and the health care industry. Manufacturing and agriculture primarily drive the Indiana economy. Steel, transportation equipment, and food products are the leading manufactures in Indiana. Indianas production of corn and wheat support its livestock and meatpacking industries as well as its dairy industry. Missouris economy relies mainly on industry. Aerospace and transportation equipment production as well as printing and publishing are important to the economic growth. Missouris mining concerns are also vital to the economy. Missouri is a leading producer of coal, zinc and lead. The economy along the I 85 corridor in South Carolina is home to numerous multinational manufacturers, resulting in one of the highest per capita foreign investment areas in the nation. Auto manufacturing has become increasingly important in recent years. The economy in Iowa is heavily influenced by agriculture. Iowa is one of the leaders in the production of corn and soybeans. In recent years manufacturing has become increasingly important. Top products include farm machinery, tires and chemicals. 27 Table of Contents The economy of Kentucky is primarily industrial, including manufacturing of electrical equipment, automobiles and food products. Tourism has become increasingly important in recent years. Kentucky is also a leading producer of coal. Timber products and agriculture continue to be important to the Mississippi economy, although tourism and entertainment have become important in recent years. Mississippis primary agricultural products include poultry, catfish and dairy. The North Carolina economy is diversified with manufacturing, agriculture, financial services and textiles as its primary industries. North Carolina has experienced population growth well in excess of the national average in recent years. The economy is further supported by three state universities, which provide stable employment and serve as research centers in the area. The Illinois economy is diversified with manufacturing, mining, textiles and agriculture. Illinois manufactured products include food products, fabricated and primary metal products, chemicals and published materials. Illinois ranks high among the states in the production of coal as well as corn, soybeans hay and wheat. The economies in the markets served by Regions continue to be among the best in the nation. General economic conditions deteriorated throughout the nation in 2001 and did not show significant recovery in 2002. In 2003, various sectors of the economy reported growth, while others continued the slow growth trends of 2002. Generally, economic conditions continued to improve during 2004. Commercial. Regions commercial loan portfolio is highly diversified within the markets it serves. Geographically, the largest concentration is the 19% of the portfolio in the state of Alabama. Loans in Tennessee account for 13% of the commercial loan portfolio, while Florida and Georgia each account for 11%. Arkansas accounts for 10% of the commercial loan portfolio, followed by Louisiana with 8%, Texas with 6%, Indiana, Missouri and Mississippi with 5% each, South Carolina with 3%, and Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky and North Carolina with 1% each. A small portion of these loans is secured by properties outside Regions banking market areas. Included in the commercial loan classification are $1.4 billion of syndicated loans. Syndicated loans are typically made to national companies and are originated through an agent bank. Regions syndicated loans are primarily to national companies with operations in Regions banking footprint. From 2000 to 2004, net commercial loan losses as a percent of average commercial loans outstanding ranged from a low of 0.41% in 2000 to a high of 0.88% in 2001. Commercial loan losses in 2004 totaled $77.8 million, or 0.61% of average commercial loans compared to 0.71% in 2003. The lower percentage of commercial loan losses in 2004 compared to 2003 resulted primarily from lower losses related to agribusiness customers. Future losses are a function of many variables, of which general economic conditions are the most important. Assuming moderate to slow economic growth during 2005 in Regions market areas, net commercial loan losses in 2005 are expected to be near the 2004 level. Real Estate. Regions real estate loan portfolio consists of construction and land development loans, loans to businesses for long term financing of land and buildings, loans on one to four family residential properties, loans to mortgage banking companies (which are secured primarily by loans on one to four family residential properties and are known as warehoused mortgage loans) and various other loans secured by real estate. Real estate construction loans increased $2.0 billion in 2004 to $5.5 billion or 9.5% of Regions total loan portfolio. Over the last five years real estate construction loans averaged 10.7% of Regions total loan portfolio. During 2002 and 2003, construction loan demand declined as the economy exhibited signs of weakness. In 2004, as the economic conditions improved, loan demand increased as new construction projects increased. Most of the construction loans relate to shopping centers, apartment complexes, commercial buildings and residential property development. These loans are normally secured by land and buildings and are generally backed by commitments for long term financing from other financial institutions. Real estate construction loans are closely monitored by management, since these loans are generally considered riskier than other types 28 Table of Contents of loans and are particularly vulnerable in economic downturns and in periods of high interest rates. Regions generally requires higher levels of borrower equity investment in addition to other underwriting requirements for this type of lending as compared to other real estate lending. Regions has not been an active lender to real estate developers outside its market areas. The loans to businesses for long term financing of land and buildings are primarily to commercial customers within Regions markets. Total loans secured by non farm, non residential properties totaled $11.2 billion at December 31, 2004. Although some risk is inherent in this type of lending, Regions attempts to minimize this risk by generally making a significant amount of these type loans only on owner occupied properties, and by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount, adequate cash flow to service the debt, and in most cases, the personal guarantees of principals of the borrowers. Regions also attempts to mitigate the risks of real estate lending by adhering to standard loan underwriting policies and by diversifying the portfolio both geographically within its market area and within industry groups. Loans on one to four family residential properties, which total approximately 55% of Regions real estate mortgage portfolio, are principally on single family residences. These loans are geographically dispersed throughout Regions market areas, and some are guaranteed by government agencies or private mortgage insurers. Historically, this category of loans has not produced sizable loan losses; however, it is subject to some of the same risks as other real estate lending. Warehoused mortgage loans, since they are secured primarily by loans on one to four family residential properties, are similar to these loans in terms of risk. From 2000 to 2004, net losses on real estate loans as a percent of average real estate loans outstanding ranged from a high of 0.10% in 2004, to a low of .04% in 2001. In 2004 real estate loan losses were relatively flat as compared to 2003. These losses depend, to a large degree, on the level of interest rates, economic conditions and collateral values, and thus, are very difficult to predict. Management expects 2005 net real estate loan losses to be near the 2004 level. Consumer. Regions consumer loan portfolio consists of $4.2 billion in consumer loans and $5.2 billion in personal lines of credit (including home equity loans). Consumer loans are primarily borrowings of individuals for home improvements, automobiles and other personal and household purposes. Regions consumer loan portfolio includes $656 million of indirect consumer auto loans at December 31, 2004, $10 million at December 31, 2003 and $30 million at December 31, 2002. Indirect consumer loans increased significantly in 2004 due to the reclassification, at fair value, of $430 million of indirect auto loans from the loans held for sale category and loans added through the Union Planters merger. Personal lines of credit increased $3.3 billion in 2004 due to the Union Planters merger and home equity loan promotions, which included a low introductory interest rate and reduced closing costs. During the past five years, the ratio of net consumer loan losses to average consumer loans ranged from a low of 0.29% in 2003 to a high of 0.82% in 2000. Net consumer loan losses were 0.36% of average consumer loans in 2004. Consumer loan losses increased slightly in 2004 due to higher losses associated with the additional indirect auto loans included in the portfolio. Consumer loan losses declined from 2000 to 2003. The lower levels of net consumer loan losses were primarily due to improvements in the collection and recovery process, standardizing and improvement of underwriting procedures, reduced credit card charge offs resulting from the sale of the credit card portfolio in 2000 and reduced indirect consumer loan charge offs resulting from the reclassification and subsequent securitization and sale of indirect consumer loans. Consumer loan losses are difficult to predict but historically have tended to increase during periods of economic weakness. Management expects net consumer loan losses in 2005 to be slightly higher than the 2004 level. Non Performing Assets At December 31, 2004, non accrual loans totaled $388.4 million, or 0.68% of loans, compared to $250.3 million, or 0.78% of loans, at December 31, 2003. The increase in non accrual loans at December 31, 2004, was due to non accrual loans added in connection with the Union Planters transaction, partially offset by lower levels of commercial loans being placed on non accrual status. Commercial loans comprised $142.6 million of the 2004 total, with real estate loans accounting for $234.3 million and consumer loans $11.5 million. 29 Table of Contents Regions non performing loan portfolio is composed primarily of a number of small to medium sized loans that are diversified geographically throughout its franchise. The 25 largest non accrual loans range from $1.5 million to $10.8 million, with only one non accrual loan greater than $10 million. These loans are widely dispersed among a number of industries and are generally highly collateralized. Of the $388.4 million in non accrual loans at December 31, 2004, approximately $140.9 million (36% of total non accrual loans) are secured by single family residences, which historically have had very low loss ratios. Subsequent to year end 2004, a customer in the marine construction industry filed for bankruptcy. The aggregate indebtedness of this customer to Regions totals approximately $60 million. This credit is well secured and is current on all principal and interest payments, and consequently was not included as a non accrual loan as of December 31, 2004. Management will continue to closely monitor this credit in 2005. Loans contractually past due 90 days or more were 0.13% of total loans at December 31, 2004, compared to 0.11% of total loans at December 31, 2003. Since December 31, 2003, loan delinquencies have increased, primarily in the commercial and real estate category, due to past due loans added in connection with the Union Planters transaction. Loans past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2004, consisted of $45.0 million in commercial and real estate loans and $29.8 million in consumer loans. Renegotiated loans totaled $279,000 at December 31, 2004, compared to $886,000 at December 31, 2003. Renegotiated loan balances continue to represent a de minimus amount of total non performing assets. Other real estate totaled $63.6 million at December 31, 2004, $52.2 million at December 31, 2003, and $59.6 million at December 31, 2002. The increase in 2004 resulted primarily from parcels added in connection with the Union Planters transaction. The decline in other real estate in 2003 compared to the prior year resulted primarily from management initiatives to reduce other real estate levels through increased sales. In 2003, sales of other real estate totaled $119.4 million. Regions other real estate is composed primarily of a number of small to medium size properties that are diversified geographically throughout its franchise. The 25 largest parcels of other real estate range in recorded value from $329,000 to $2.4 million, with only six parcels over $1 million. Other real estate is recorded at the lower of (1) the recorded investment in the loan or (2) fair value less the estimated cost to sell. Although Regions does not anticipate material loss upon disposition of other real estate, sustained periods of adverse economic conditions, substantial declines in real estate values in Regions markets, actions by bank regulatory agencies, or other factors, could result in additional loss from other real estate. The amount of interest income recognized in 2004 on the $388.4 million of non accruing loans outstanding at year end was approximately $11.4 million. If these loans had been current in accordance with their original terms, approximately $27.2 million would have been recognized on these loans in 2004. Funding Commitments In the normal course of business, Regions makes commitments under various terms to lend funds to its customers. These commitments include (among others) revolving credit agreements, term loan agreements and short term borrowing arrangements, which are usually for working capital needs. Letters of credit are also issued, which under certain conditions could result in loans. See Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The following table shows the amount and duration of Regions funding commitments.

This category of earning assets increased from $96.5 million at December 31, 2003, to $115.0 million at December 31, 2004, as investments in this earning asset category were added through the merger with Union Planters. Securities The following table shows the carrying values of securities by category: 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Securities held to maturity: U.S. Treasury and Federal agency securities $ 31,152 $ 30,189 $ 30,571 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 0 754 2,335 Other securities 0 0 3 Total $ 31,152 $ 30,943 $ 32,909 Securities available for sale: U.S. Treasury and Federal agency securities $ 4,375,697 $ 2,568,163 $ 1,957,593 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 569,060 451,594 543,798 Mortgage backed securities 6,980,513 5,703,057 6,147,946 Other securities 179,374 101,825 42,315 Equity securities 480,793 232,222 270,039 Total $ 12,585,437 $ 9,056,861 $ 8,961,691 In 2004, total securities increased $3.5 billion, or 39%. The significant increase was related to securities added through the Union Planters transaction. U.S. Treasury and Federal agency securities increased $1.8 billion due to the Union Planters acquisition, partially offset by sales of agency securities. Agency securities were sold in 2004 to offset declines in the fair value of Regions mortgage servicing assets, as security values respond inversely to a change in interest rates. Mortgage backed securities increased $1.3 billion due to balances added in connection with the merger with Union Planters partially offset by maturities as well as sales of mortgage backed securities to manage interest rate sensitivity. In 2003, total securities increased $93 million, or 1%. U.S. Treasury and Federal agency securities increased $610 million due to purchases of agency securities to better balance Regions interest rate sensitivity and to offset possible declines in the fair value of Regions mortgage servicing assets, as security values respond inversely to a change in interest rates. Mortgage backed securities decreased $445 million due to sales, prepayments and other maturities in 2003. Obligations of states and political subdivisions decreased $94 million or 17% in 2003 due to calls, sales and maturities. Other securities increased in 2003 due to interest only residual securities and other securities retained in auto loan securitizations (see Note 6 Asset Securitizations to the consolidated financial statements). Regions investment portfolio policy stresses quality and liquidity. At December 31, 2004, the average contractual maturity of U.S. Treasury and Federal agency securities was 4.8 years and that of obligations of states and political subdivisions was 7.1 years. The average contractual maturity of mortgage backed securities was 14.5 years and their expected maturity was 3.0 years. Other securities had an average contractual maturity of 10.2 years. Overall, the average maturity of the portfolio was 10.7 years using contractual maturities and 3.6 years using expected maturities. Expected maturities differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. 32 Table of Contents The estimated fair market value of Regions securities held to maturity portfolio at December 31, 2004, was $778,000 below the amount carried on Regions books. Regions securities held to maturity at December 31, 2004, included unrealized losses of $778,000 and no unrealized gains. Regions securities available for sale portfolio at December 31, 2004, included net unrealized gains of $80 million. Regions securities held to maturity and securities available for sale portfolios included gross unrealized gains of $144.4 million and gross unrealized losses of $65.2 million at December 31, 2004. Market values of these portfolios vary significantly as interest rates change. Management expects normal maturities from the securities portfolios to meet liquidity needs. Of Regions tax free securities rated by Moodys Investors Service, Inc., 99% are rated A or better. The portfolio is carefully monitored to assure no unreasonable concentration of securities in the obligations of a single debtor, and current credit reviews are conducted on each security holding. The following table shows the contractual maturities of securities (excluding equity securities) at December 31, 2004, the weighted average yields and the taxable equivalent adjustment used in calculating the yields: Securities Maturing After One After Five Within But Within But Within After One Year Five Years Ten Years Ten Years Total (dollar amounts in thousands) Securities held to maturity: U.S. Treasury and Federal agency securities $ 5,024 $ 17,438 $ 6,557 $ 2,133 $ 31,152 Total $ 5,024 $ 17,438 $ 6,557 $ 2,133 $ 31,152 Weighted average yield 5.66 % 4.60 % 4.50 % 5.04 % 4.78 % Securities available for sale: U.S. Treasury and Federal agency securities $ 234,679 $ 2,576,010 $ 1,565,008 $ 0 $ 4,375,697 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 35,857 132,742 283,962 116,499 569,060 Mortgage backed securities 425 50,747 1,447,291 5,482,050 6,980,513 Other securities 17,119 64,693 219 97,343 179,374 Total $ 288,080 $ 2,824,192 $ 3,296,480 $ 5,695,892 $ 12,104,644 Weighted average yield 3.55 % 3.47 % 4.81 % 4.33 % 4.25 % Taxable equivalent adjustment for calculation of yield $ 901 $ 3,340 $ 7,143 $ 2,930 $ 14,314 Note: The weighted average yields are calculated on the basis of the yield to maturity based on the book value of each security. Weighted average yields on tax exempt obligations have been computed on a fully taxable equivalent basis using a tax rate of 35%. Yields on tax exempt obligations have not been adjusted for the non deductible portion of interest expense used to finance the purchase of tax exempt obligations. 33 Table of Contents Trading Account Assets Trading account assets increased $112.6 million to $928.7 million at December 31, 2004. Trading account assets are held for the purpose of selling at a profit and are carried at market value. The following table shows the carrying value of trading account assets by type of security. December 31, 2004 2003 (in thousands) Trading account assets: U.S. Treasury and Federal agency securities $ 708,938 $ 563,761 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 150,049 169,103 Other securities 69,689 83,210 Total $ 928,676 $ 816,074 Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale include residential real estate mortgage loans, as well as factored accounts receivable and asset based loans. These loans totaled $1.8 billion ($1.6 billion of residential mortgage loans and $176 million of factored receivables and asset based loans) at December 31, 2004, an increase of $541 million compared to December 31, 2003. This increase was due to loans held for sale added through the merger with Union Planters, partially offset by a reclassification, at fair value, of $430 million of indirect consumer auto loans. The indirect consumer auto loans were reclassified from loans held for sale to consumer loans since Regions is no longer originating and securitizing these type loans. Margin Receivables Margin receivables totaled $477.8 million at December 31, 2004, and $503.6 million at December 31, 2003. Margin receivables represent funds advanced to brokerage customers for the purchase of securities that are secured by certain marketable securities held in the customers brokerage account. The risk of loss from these receivables is minimized by requiring that customers maintain marketable securities in the brokerage account which have a fair market value substantially in excess of the funds advanced to the customer. Excess Purchase Price Excess purchase price at December 31, 2004, totaled $5.0 billion compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2003. The increase is related to excess purchase price added in connection with the merger with Union Planters (see Note 18 Business Combinations to the consolidated financial statements). Other Identifiable Intangible Assets Other identifiable intangible assets totaled $356.9 million at December 31, 2004, compared to $4.1 million at December 31, 2003. This balance consists primarily of core deposit intangibles added in connection with the Union Planters transaction. Other Assets Other assets increased $441 million compared to December 31, 2003. This increase was primarily the result of assets added through the Union Planters merger as well as increases in derivative asset balances. Liquidity General Liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and affects Regions ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of its customers. Assets, consisting principally of 34 Table of Contents loans and securities, are funded by customer deposits, purchased funds, borrowed funds and stockholders equity. The securities portfolio is one of Regions primary sources of liquidity. Maturities of securities provide a constant flow of funds available for cash needs (see previous table on Securities Maturing). Maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds (see previous table on Loans Maturing). At December 31, 2004, commercial loans, real estate construction loans and commercial mortgage loans with an aggregate balance of $14.1 billion, as well as securities of $293 million, were due to mature in one year or less. Additional funds are provided from payments on consumer loans and one to four family residential mortgage loans. Historically, Regions high levels of earnings have also contributed to cash flow. In addition, liquidity needs can be met by the purchase of funds in state and national money markets. Regions liquidity also continues to be enhanced by a relatively stable deposit base. The loan to deposit ratio was 98.06% and 98.33% at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, representing an increase compared to 94.11% at December 31, 2002. This increase is the result of loan growth exceeding deposit growth in 2003. As shown in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, operating activities provided significant levels of funds in 2004, 2003 and 2002, due primarily to high levels of net income. Investing activities were a net provider of funds in 2004 primarily due to maturities and sale of securities available for sale. Securities were sold in 2004 to manage interest rate sensitivity. Investing activities, primarily in loans and securities, were a net user of funds in 2003 and 2002. Loan growth in 2003 and 2002 required a significant amount of funds for investing activities. Funds needed for investing activities in 2003 and 2002 were provided primarily by deposits, purchased funds and borrowings. Financing activities were a net user of funds in 2004, as payments on long term borrowings used funding in 2004 as Regions (excluding borrowings added in connection with acquisitions) was less dependent on borrowed funds as a funding source. Increased deposits provided funds in 2004. In 2003, financing activities were a net user of funds as a result of declining deposit balances and increased payments on borrowed funds. In 2002, financing activities were a significant provider of funds as a result of strong deposit growth and proceeds from long term borrowings. Cash dividends and the open market purchase of Regions common stock also required funds in 2004, 2003 and 2002. Regions financing arrangement with the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta adds additional flexibility in managing its liquidity position. The maximum amount that could be borrowed from the Federal Home Loan Bank under the current borrowing agreement is approximately $14.8 billion. Additional investment in Federal Home Loan Bank stock is required with each advance. The Federal Home Loan Bank has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of funding and can be used to fund debt maturities as well as other obligations. As of December 31, 2004, Regions borrowings from the Federal Home Loan Bank totaled $3.1 billion. Regions has two shelf registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Under these registration statements, as of December 31, 2004, $1.1 billion of various debt securities could be registered and subsequently issued, at market rates, to satisfy future liquidity and funding needs (see Note 10 Borrowed Funds to the consolidated financial statements). In addition, Regions bank subsidiaries have the requisite agreements in place to issue and sell up to $5 billion of bank notes to institutional investors through placement agents. As of December 31, 2004, approximately $1 billion of bank notes were outstanding, including $400 million of bank notes issued by Regions Bank under the agreement referenced above. Additionally, approximately $600 million of bank notes issued by UPBNA, which were assumed by Regions in connection with the Union Planters transaction, are also outstanding. The issuance of additional bank notes could provide a significant source of liquidity and funding to meet future needs. Morgan Keegan maintains certain lines of credit with unaffiliated banks to manage liquidity in the ordinary course of business. 35 Table of Contents Ratings The table below reflects the most recent debt ratings of Regions Financial Corporation, Regions Bank and UPBNA by Standard & Poors Corporation, Moodys Investors Service and Fitch IBCA: S&P Moodys Fitch Regions Financial Corporation: Senior notes A A1 A+ Subordinated notes A A2 A Trust preferred securities BBB+ A2 A Regions Bank: Short term certificates of deposit A 1 P 1 F1+ Short term debt A 1 P 1 F1+ Long term certificates of deposit A+ Aa3 AA Long term debt A+ Aa3 A+ Union Planters Bank, National Association: Short term certificates of deposit A 1 P 1 F1+ Short term debt A 1 P 1 F1+ Long term certificates of deposit A+ Aa3 AA Long term debt A+ Aa3 A+ In connection with the merger of Union Planters with Regions, UPBNAs ratings were upgraded to match those of Regions Bank. Regions and Regions Banks ratings remain unchanged from the prior year. A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and the ratings above are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The trust that issued the trust preferred securities was deconsolidated on December 31, 2003, in connection with the implementation of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46). Upon deconsolidation, the junior subordinated notes that are owned by the trust were included in consolidated long term borrowings. Payments made by the Company on the junior subordinated notes fully fund the payments made by the trust on the rated trust preferred securities. See Note 19 Variable Interest Entities for additional discussion on the deconsolidation of the trust. Deposits Deposits are Regions primary source of funds, providing funding for 76% of average earning assets in 2004, 73% in 2003 and 74% in 2002. During the last five years, average total deposits increased at a compound annual rate of 9%. Deposit growth was significantly impacted by the merger with Union Planters. The Union Planters transaction added $22.9 billion of total deposits ($11.5 billion of average deposits due to the mid year closing of the transaction). Total deposits added in connection with the Union Planters merger are summarized in the following table. (in thousands) Non interest bearing $ 5,373,199 Savings 1,484,900 Interest bearing transaction accounts 3,383,281 Money market 5,863,360 Time deposits 6,798,524 Total $ 22,903,264 Average deposits increased $12.9 billion, or 40% in 2004, $755 million, or 2% in 2003 and $318 million, or 1% in 2002. Acquisitions contributed average deposit growth of $11.5 billion in 2004, $14 million in 2003 and 36 Table of Contents $176 million in 2002. The $11.5 billion of deposits, added through acquisitions in 2004, are comprised of $2.7 billion of non interest bearing deposits and $8.8 billion of interest bearing deposits and significantly impact comparisons with prior periods discussed in the remainder of this section. Regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market. Regions ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on how effectively the Company meets customers needs. Regions employs both traditional and non traditional means to meet customers needs and enhance competitiveness. The traditional means include providing well designed products, providing a high level of customer service, providing attractive pricing and expanding the traditional branch network to provide convenient branch locations for customers throughout Regions geographic footprint. Regions also employs non traditional approaches to enhance its competitiveness. These include providing centralized, high quality telephone banking services and alternative product delivery channels like internet banking. Regions success at competing for deposits is discussed below. Average non interest bearing deposits have increased at a compound growth rate of 23% since 2001. This category of deposits grew 61% in 2004, 9% in 2003 and 6% in 2002. Non interest bearing deposits continue to be a significant funding source for Regions, accounting for 19% of average total deposits in 2004, 17% in 2003 and 16% in 2002. Savings account balances have increased at a 20% compound growth rate since 2001. Savings accounts increased 53% in 2004, due to the Union Planters acquisition, but declined slightly in 2003 as rates paid on these accounts were less attractive than other investment alternatives. In 2002, as investors migrated to traditional, more liquid investments, savings accounts increased 13%. Management expects savings accounts to continue to be a stable funding source, but does not expect any significant growth given the current interest rate expectations. In 2004, savings accounts accounted for approximately 5% of average total deposits, compared to approximately 4% of average total deposits in 2003. Interest bearing transaction accounts have increased at a 74% compound growth rate since 2001. Interest bearing transaction accounts increased 31% in 2004, 134% in 2003 and 72% in 2002 as investors migrated toward more liquid assets given recent market conditions. Interest bearing transaction accounts accounted for 7% of average total deposits in 2004 and 2003. Money market savings accounts have increased at a compound annual rate of 16% since 2001. Money market savings accounts increased 42% in 2004 due to acquisitions. In 2003, as Regions less aggressively priced money market savings products, average balances declined 2%. Money market savings increased 13% in 2002. Money market savings products are one of Regions most significant funding sources, accounting for 34% of average total deposits in 2004, 33% of average total deposits in 2003 and 34% of average total deposits in 2002. Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more increased 53% in 2004 due to acquisitions and increased 2% in 2003 due to less maturities of high cost certificates of deposits than in prior years. Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more declined 22% in 2002 as these products were priced less aggressively. Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more accounted for 11% of average total deposits in 2004 and 10% in 2003 and 2002. Other interest bearing deposits (certificates of deposit of less than $100,000 and time open accounts) increased 22% in 2004 due to acquisitions and internal growth in retail certificates of deposits due to more attractive market interest rates. In 2003 and 2002, this category of deposits declined 8% as rates on these accounts were less attractive to investors and Regions reduced utilization of certain wholesale deposits as a funding source. This category of deposits continues to be one of Regions primary funding sources; it accounted for 25% of average total deposits in 2004, 29% of average total deposits in 2003 and 32% of average total deposits in 2002. During recent years, management has increased lower cost deposit products as a source of funding, while reducing the companys reliance on higher cost deposit products such as certificates of deposit and wholesale deposit products. This effort has been accomplished through pricing and other initiatives which have increased lower cost deposit products and reduced higher cost, single product certificates of deposit as a percentage of Regions deposit funding sources. Lower cost deposits, which include non interest bearing demand deposits, 37 Table of Contents interest bearing transaction accounts, savings accounts and money market savings accounts, totaled 65% of average deposits in 2004, compared to 61% in 2003 and 58% in 2002. The sensitivity of Regions deposit rates to changes in market interest rates is reflected in Regions average interest rate paid on interest bearing deposits. Since 2001, market interest rates declined 50 basis points in 2002 and 25 basis points in 2003, but increased 125 basis points in the latter half of 2004. While Regions average interest rate paid on interest bearing deposits follows these trends, a lag period exists between the change in market rates and the repricing of the deposits. The rate paid on interest bearing deposits decreased from 2.47% in 2002 and 1.61% in 2003 to 1.37% in 2004. A detail of interest bearing deposit balances at December 31, 2004 and 2003, and the interest expense on these deposits for the three years ended December 31, 2004, is presented in Note 9 Deposits to the consolidated financial statements. The following table presents the average rates paid on deposits by category for the three years ended December 31, 2004: Average Rates Paid 2004 2003 2002 Interest bearing transaction accounts 1.05 % 0.95 % 1.13 % Savings accounts 0.22 0.27 0.60 Money market savings accounts 0.70 0.70 1.30 Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more 2.14 2.54 3.86 Other interest bearing deposits 2.23 2.71 3.70 Total interest bearing deposits 1.37 % 1.61 % 2.47 % The following table presents the details of interest bearing deposits and maturities of the larger time deposits at December 31, 2004 and 2003: December 31, 2004 2003 (in thousands) Interest bearing deposits of less than $100,000 $ 39,726,214 $ 23,411,864 Time deposits of $100,000 or more, maturing in: 3 months or less 3,118,693 1,213,135 Over 3 through 6 months 1,235,081 809,022 Over 6 through 12 months 1,615,101 714,722 Over 12 months 1,547,797 866,045 7,516,672 3,602,924 Total $ 47,242,886 $ 27,014,788 The following table presents the average amounts of deposits outstanding by category for the three years ended December 31, 2004: Average Amounts Outstanding 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Non interest bearing demand deposits $ 8,656,768 $ 5,380,521 $ 4,933,496 Interest bearing transaction accounts 2,931,652 2,234,794 956,132 Savings accounts 2,176,025 1,425,306 1,429,837 Money market savings accounts 15,105,420 10,641,217 10,845,376 Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more 4,952,292 3,232,152 3,165,020 Other interest bearing deposits 11,193,122 9,194,462 10,023,609 Total interest bearing deposits 36,358,511 26,727,931 26,419,974 Total deposits $ 45,015,279 $ 32,108,452 $ 31,353,470 38 Table of Contents Borrowed Funds Regions short term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and security repurchase agreements, commercial paper, Federal Home Loan Bank structured notes, due to brokerage customers, and other short term borrowings. Federal funds purchased and security repurchase agreements are used to satisfy daily funding needs and, when advantageous, for rate arbitrage. Federal funds purchased and security repurchase agreements totaled $4.7 billion at December 31, 2004 and $3.0 billion at December 31, 2003. Balances in these accounts can fluctuate significantly on a day to day basis. The average daily balance of federal funds purchased and security repurchase agreements, net of federal funds sold and security reverse repurchase agreements, increased $1.3 billion in 2004 and 2003 due to increased reliance on purchased funds to support earning asset growth. Throughout 2004 and 2003, Federal Home Loan Bank structured notes were used as a short term funding source, primarily due to their favorable interest rates. These structured notes have original stated maturities in excess of one year, but are callable, at the option of the Federal Home Loan Bank, at various times less than one year. Because of the call feature, the structured notes are considered short term. The amount of structured notes outstanding was $350 million as of December 31, 2004 and 2003 and $850 million at December 31, 2002. During 2003, Regions prepaid $350 million of these advances in addition to maturities of $150 million. Regions incurred a $11.5 million charge related to the prepayment in 2003 that is recorded in other non interest expense (see Note 16 Other Income and Expense to the consolidated financial statements). Morgan Keegan maintains certain lines of credit with unaffiliated banks. As of December 31, 2004, $56.4 million was outstanding under these agreements with an average interest rate of 2.6%, compared to $91.2 million outstanding at December 31, 2003, with an average interest rate of 1.4%. From time to time, Regions issues commercial paper through its private placement commercial paper program. No commercial paper balances were outstanding as of December 31, 2004. Regions policy limits total commercial paper outstanding, at any time, to $75 million. The level of commercial paper outstanding depends on the funding requirements of Regions and the cost of commercial paper compared to alternative borrowing sources. As of December 31, 2003, $5.5 million in commercial paper was outstanding, which matured during 2004. Regions maintains a due to brokerage customer position through Morgan Keegan. This represents liquid funds in customers brokerage accounts. The due to brokerage customers totaled $457.7 million at December 31, 2004, with an interest rate of 0.7%, as compared to $544.8 million at December 31, 2003, with an interest rate of 0.4%. Regions holds cash as collateral for certain derivative and other transactions with customers and other third parties. Upon the expiration of these agreements, cash held as collateral will be remitted to the counter party. As of December 31, 2004, these balances totaled $75.8 million with an interest rate of 2.0%, as compared to $68.3 million at December 31, 2003 with an interest rate of 0.9%. Other short term borrowings increased $40.3 million from December 31, 2003, to December 31, 2004, due primarily to an increase in the short sale liability, which is frequently used by Morgan Keegan to offset other market risks, which are undertaken in the normal course of business. Regions long term borrowings consist primarily of subordinated notes, Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings, senior notes and other long term notes payable. As of December 31, 2004, Regions had subordinated notes of $2.2 billion compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2003. The merger with Union Planters added $1.0 billion in subordinated notes. Regions subordinated notes consist of six issues with interest rates ranging from 6.375% to 7.75%. A schedule of maturities is included in the table at the end of this section. During 2004 and 2003, Regions utilized Federal Home Loan Bank structured notes with original call periods in excess of one year. These structured notes have various stated maturities but are callable, at the option of the Federal Home Loan Bank, between one and two years. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, 39 Table of Contents $1.8 billion and $2.8 billion of long term Federal Home Loan Bank advances were outstanding, respectively. In 2004, Regions prepaid $1.1 billion of these advances and as a result incurred a $39.6 million charge which is recorded in other non interest expense. In 2003, Regions prepaid $300 million of these advances and incurred a $9.1 million charge (see Note 16 Other Income and Expense to the consolidated financial statements). Federal Home Loan Bank long term advances totaled $946 million at December 31, 2004, an increase of $139 million compared to 2003. Regions utilized this source of funding due to favorable interest rates and terms during 2004 and 2003. Membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system provides access to an additional source of lower cost funds. Regions issued $288 million of trust preferred securities in February 2001. These securities, which qualify as Tier 1 capital, have an interest rate of 8.00% and a 30 year term, but are callable after five years. In addition, Regions assumed $4 million of trust preferred securities in connection with a 2001 acquisition. Effective December 31, 2003, all trust preferred securities were deconsolidated in accordance with FIN 46 (see Note 19 Variable Interest Entities and Note 25 Recent Accounting Pronouncements to the consolidated financial statements). As a result of the deconsolidation of trust preferred securities, effective December 31, 2003, Regions began reporting $301 million of junior subordinated notes. These junior subordinated notes are issued by Regions to a subsidiary business trust, which issued the trust preferred securities discussed previously (see Note 19 Variable Interest Entities to the consolidated financial statements). In 2004, $224 million of junior subordinated notes were assumed in connection with the Union Planters transaction. Senior debt and bank notes totaled $1.5 billion at December 31, 2004, an increase of $1.1 billion related to notes assumed in the Union Planters transaction. Other long term borrowings consist of redeemable trust preferred securities, notes issued to former stockholders of acquired banks, notes for equipment financing, mark to market adjustments related to hedged debt items, and miscellaneous notes payable. The following table shows the amount and maturity of Regions long term borrowed funds as of December 31, 2004. Payments Due by Period 2010 & Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Beyond (in thousands) Obligations: Subordinated notes $ 2,191,317 $ 103,225 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 2,088,092 Junior subordinated notes 525,015 0 0 0 0 0 525,015 Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings 2,730,916 750,031 601,658 1,624 67,524 1,063,406 246,673 Senior debt and bank notes 1,501,006 0 400,000 617,050 0 0 483,956 Other long term obligations 291,331 126,620 1,281 1,325 1,506 758 159,841 Total $ 7,239,585 $ 979,876 $ 1,002,939 $ 619,999 $ 69,030 $ 1,064,164 $ 3,503,577 40 Table of Contents Stockholders Equity Over the past three years, stockholders equity has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 39%. Stockholders equity has grown from $4.0 billion at the beginning of 2002 to $10.7 billion at year end 2004. Equity issued in connection with acquisitions, net of treasury share repurchases, added $5.4 billion, including $6.0 billion in equity issued in connection with the Union Planters merger. Internally generated retained earnings contributed $1.1 billion of this growth and $218 million was attributable to the exercise of stock options and to the issuance of stock for employee incentive plans. The internal capital generation rate (net income less dividends as a percentage of average stockholders equity) was 4.3% in 2004, compared to 8.7% in 2003 and 8.9% in 2002. This ratio declined in 2004 primarily due to a significant increase in cash dividends in 2004. Regions has a current board of directors authorization to repurchase up to 20.0 million shares of common stock. During 2004, Regions repurchased, under the current and previous repurchase authorizations, 6.0 million shares at a total cost of $186.3 million. At December 31, 2004, 19.2 million shares were available for repurchase under the current authorization. Regions ratio of stockholders equity to total assets was 12.78% at December 31, 2004, compared to 9.16% at December 31, 2003, and 8.72% at December 31, 2002. This ratio increased in 2004 due to the equity added from the Union Planters merger. Regions ratio of tangible stockholders equity (stockholders equity less excess purchase price and other identifiable intangibles) to total assets was 6.42% at December 31, 2004 compared to 6.92% at December 31, 2003 and 6.49% at December 31, 2002. Regions attempts to balance the return to stockholders through the payment of dividends, with the need to maintain strong capital levels for future growth opportunities. In 2004, Regions returned 61% of earnings to its stockholders in the form of dividends. Total dividends declared by Regions in 2004 were $489.8 million or $1.33 per share, an increase of 33% from the $1.00 per share in 2003. In January 2005, the Board of Directors declared a 2.0% increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $.3334 to $.34 per share. This is the 34th consecutive year that Regions has increased quarterly cash dividends. Bank Regulatory Capital Requirements Regions, Regions Bank and UPBNA are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by banking regulatory agencies. Currently, there are two basic measures of capital adequacy: a risk based measure and a leverage measure. The risk based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and financial holding companies, to account for off balance sheet exposure and interest rate risk, and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with specified risk weighting factors. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items. Banking organizations that are considered to have excessive interest rate risk exposure are required to maintain additional capital. The minimum standard for the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 8%. At least 50% of that capital level must consist of common equity, undivided profits and non cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less goodwill and certain other intangibles (Tier 1 capital). The remainder (Tier 2 capital) may consist of a limited amount of other preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, subordinated debt and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses. The sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital is total risk based capital. 41 Table of Contents The banking regulatory agencies also have adopted regulations that supplement the risk based guidelines to include a minimum ratio of 3% of Tier 1 capital to average assets less goodwill (the leverage ratio). Depending upon the risk profile of the institution and other factors, the regulatory agencies may require a leverage ratio of 1% to 2% above the minimum 3% level. The following chart summarizes the applicable bank regulatory capital requirements. Regions capital ratios at December 31, 2004, substantially exceeded all regulatory requirements. Minimum Well Capitalized Regions at Regulatory Regulatory December 31, Requirement Requirement 2004 Tier 1 capital to risk adjusted assets 4.00 % 6.00 % 9.04 % Total risk based capital to risk adjusted assets 8.00 10.00 13.51 Tier 1 leverage ratio 3.00 5.00 7.47 At December 31, 2004, Tier 1 capital totaled $5.9 billion, total risk based capital totaled $8.8 billion, and risk adjusted assets totaled $78.8 billion. Total capital at Regions Bank and UPBNA also has an important effect on the amount of FDIC insurance premiums paid. Institutions not considered well capitalized can be subject to higher rates for FDIC insurance. As of December 31, 2004, Regions Bank and UPBNA had the requisite capital levels to qualify as well capitalized. 42 Table of Contents Consolidated Average Balances The following table shows the percentage distribution of Regions consolidated average balances of assets, liabilities and stockholders equity as of the dates shown: As of December 31, 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000 ASSETS Earning assets: Taxable securities 15.8 % 18.0 % 17.2 % 16.5 % 20.1 % Non taxable securities 0.7 1.0 1.3 1.8 1.9 Federal funds sold 0.9 1.3 1.2 1.2 0.2 Loans (net of unearned income): Commercial 19.1 21.9 22.4 21.5 20.5 Real estate 35.9 31.7 31.6 34.9 36.4 Installment 11.8 11.2 12.9 12.9 13.3 Total loans 66.8 64.8 66.9 69.3 70.2 Allowance for loan losses (0.9 ) (0.9 ) (0.9 ) (0.9 ) (0.8 ) Net loans 65.9 63.9 66.0 68.4 69.4 Other earning assets 4.9 6.1 4.7 3.8 1.0 Total earnings assets 88.2 90.3 90.4 91.7 92.6 Cash and due from banks 2.0 2.0 2.1 2.1 2.6 Other non earning assets 9.8 7.7 7.5 6.2 4.8 Total assets 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Deposits: Non interest bearing 12.9 % 11.1 % 10.7 % 10.4 % 10.6 % Interest bearing 54.4 55.1 57.3 59.1 63.6 Total deposits 67.3 66.2 68.0 69.5 74.2 Borrowed funds: Short term 9.3 11.0 9.6 9.3 10.3 Long term 9.8 11.3 11.2 10.7 7.2 Total borrowed funds 19.1 22.3 20.8 20.0 17.5 Other liabilities 2.3 2.6 2.4 2.1 0.8 Total liabilities 88.7 91.1 91.2 91.6 92.5 Stockholders equity 11.3 8.9 8.8 8.4 7.5 Total liabilities and stockholders equity 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Please refer to Item 6 of this annual report on Form 10 K for a complete presentation of average balances, related interest, yields and rates paid. 43 Table of Contents Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, Regions enters into certain relationships characterized as off balance sheet arrangements. At December 31, 2004, these relationships included obligations under standby letters of credit and variable interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities. At December 31, 2004, the fair value of Regions obligation under loan standby letters of credit was $35.7 million with a maximum potential obligation of $2.4 billion (see Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements). At December 31, 2004, Regions investment in unconsolidated variable interest entities was $265.9 million with a maximum exposure to loss of $287.9 million (see Note 19 Variable Interest Entities to the consolidated financial statements).

The accompanying table presents the dollar amount and percentage change in the important components of income that occurred in 2003 and 2004.

Net interest income increased 43% in 2004, but decreased 2% in 2003. On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest income increased 42% in 2004, but decreased 2% in 2003. The following table Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income provides additional information to analyze the changes in net interest income. Higher spreads, combined with significant growth in interest earning assets due to the Union Planters merger, resulted in higher net interest income in 2004. The decrease in net interest income for 2003 was due to lower spreads, partially offset by modest growth in interest earning assets. Regions measures its ability to produce net interest income with a ratio called the interest margin. The interest margin is net interest income (on a taxable equivalent basis) as a percentage of average earning assets. The interest margin declined from 3.73% in 2002 to 3.49% in 2003, but increased to 3.66% in 2004. Changes in the interest margin occur primarily due to two factors: (1) the interest rate spread (the difference between the taxable equivalent yield on earning assets and the rate on interest bearing liabilities) and (2) the percentage of earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities. 45 Table of Contents The first factor affecting Regions interest margin is the interest rate spread. Regions average interest rate spread was 3.35% in 2004, 3.19% in 2003 and 3.30% in 2002. Market interest rates, both the level of rates and the slope of the yield curve (the spread between short term rates and longer term rates), affect the interest rate spread by influencing the pricing on most categories of Regions interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. After reducing the Federal Funds rate significantly in 2001, the Fed reduced the Federal Funds rate another 50 basis points in 2002. Rates were reduced again in mid 2003 by 25 basis points. As the economy experienced growth, the Fed increased the Federal Funds rate five times totaling 125 basis points in the second half of 2004. These increases resulted in a Federal Funds rate of 2.25% at December 31, 2004. Regions interest earning asset yields and interest bearing liability rates were both lower in 2004 as compared to 2003, reflecting lower average market interest rates in 2004. In 2004, Regions interest earning asset yields decreased 10 basis points while interest bearing liability rates declined 26 basis points, resulting in an increased interest rate spread, compared to 2003. The mix of earning assets can also affect the interest rate spread. During 2004, loans, which are typically Regions most significant highest yielding earning asset, increased as a percentage of earning assets. This increase contributed to higher earning asset yields. Reduced balance sheet leverage contributed to the shift in asset mix as certain maturities of the securities portfolio were not reinvested but were used to reduce borrowings. Average loans as a percentage of earning assets were 74.9% in 2004 and 71.1% in 2003. During 2004 and 2003, Regions used interest rate derivatives as cash flow and fair value hedges of certain asset and liability positions. These contracts had the effect of increasing net interest income by $106.8 million in 2004 and $108.7 million in 2003. The second factor affecting the interest margin is the percentage of earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities. Funding for Regions earning assets comes from interest bearing liabilities, non interest bearing liabilities and stockholders equity. The net spread on earning assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities and stockholders equity is higher than the net spread on earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities. The percentage of earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities was 82% in 2004 and 85% in 2003 and 2002. This decline positively impacted the net interest margin as compared to prior years. The trend has been for a greater percentage of new funding for earning assets to come from interest bearing sources. In the future, management expects that an increasing percentage of funding will be provided from interest bearing liabilities. 46 Table of Contents Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income Year Ended December 31, 2004 over 2003 2003 over 2002 Volume Yield/Rate Total Volume Yield/Rate Total (in thousands) Increase (decrease) in: Interest income on: Loans $ 688,433 $ (72,048 ) $ 616,385 $ 36,944 $ (320,848 ) $ (283,904 ) Federal funds sold 18 1,855 1,873 766 (3,315 ) (2,549 ) Taxable securities 74,590 10,654 85,244 36,955 (88,895 ) (51,940 ) Non taxable securities 211 753 964 (4,479 ) (1,133 ) (5,612 ) Other earning assets 16,612 15,477 32,089 36,437 (10,291 ) 26,146 Total 779,864 (43,309 ) 736,555 106,623 (424,482 ) (317,859 ) Interest expense on: Savings deposits 1,733 (847 ) 886 (27 ) (4,663 ) (4,690 ) Other interest bearing deposits 134,230 (68,842 ) 65,388 7,959 (225,681 ) (217,722 ) Borrowed funds 54,039 (22,194 ) 31,845 44,309 (116,766 ) (72,457 ) Total 190,002 (91,883 ) 98,119 52,241 (347,110 ) (294,869 ) Increase (decrease) in net interest income $ 589,862 $ 48,574 $ 638,436 $ 54,382 $ (77,372 ) $ (22,990 ) Note: The change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to change due to volume and change due to rate in proportion to the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each. Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices, or the credit quality of debt securities. Interest Rate Sensitivity Regions primary market risk is interest rate risk, including uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as uncertainty with respect to relative interest rate levels which impact both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves affecting the financial products and services that the Company offers. To quantify this risk Regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios as compared to a base case scenario. Net interest income sensitivity (as measured over 12 months) is a useful short term indicator of Regions interest rate risk. Sensitivity Measurement. Financial simulation models are Regions primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of hypothetical deterministic and stochastic simulations, these tools provide management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates. These models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Regions balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and the changing composition of the balance sheet that result from both strategic plans and from customer behavior. Among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business. Interest rate related risks are expressly considered, such as pricing spreads, the lag time in pricing administered rate accounts, prepayments and other option risks. Regions considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior. 47 Table of Contents Financial derivative instruments are used in hedging the values of selected assets and liabilities against changes in interest rates. The effect of these hedges is included in the simulations of net interest income. The primary objectives of Asset/ Liability Management at Regions are balance sheet coordination and the management of interest rate risk in achieving reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles. A standard set of alternate interest rate scenarios is compared to the results of the base case scenario to determine the extent of potential fluctuations and to establish exposure limits. The standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus and minus 100 and 200 basis points. In addition, Regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements that may more realistically mimic potential interest rate movements. The gradual scenarios include curve steepening, flattening, and parallel movements of various magnitudes phased in over a 6 month period. Exposure to Interest Rate Movements. Based on the foregoing discussion, management has estimated the potential effect of shifts in interest rates on net interest income. As of December 31, 2004, Regions maintains a slight asset sensitive position to a gradual rate shift of plus or minus 100 or 200 basis points. The following table demonstrates the expected effect that a gradual (over six months beginning at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively) parallel interest rate shift would have on Regions net interest income. 2004 2003 $ Change in % Change in $ Change in % Change in Net Interest Net Interest Net Interest Net Interest Gradual Change in Interest Rates Income Income Income Income (dollar amounts in thousands) (in basis points) +200 $ 60,000 2.3 % $ 38,000 2.5 % +100 48,000 1.8 19,000 1.3 100 (43,000 ) (1.6 ) (20,000 ) (1.4 ) 200 (98,000 ) (3.6 ) (42,000 ) (2.8 ) As of December 31, 2004, Regions maintains a slight asset sensitive position to an instantaneous rate shift of plus or minus 100 or 200 basis points.

The Asset and Liability Committee in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies. The most common derivatives the Company employs are interest rate swaps, interest rate options, forward sale commitments, and interest rate and foreign exchange forward contracts. Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable streams of interest payments. The notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of the interest payments. Interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a pre determined price and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell 48 Table of Contents money market instruments at a future date for an already agreed upon price. Foreign exchange forwards are contractual agreements to receive or deliver a foreign currency at an agreed upon future date and price. Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and interest rate options to convert a portion of its fixed rate funding position to a variable rate. Regions also uses derivatives to manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business. Futures contracts and forward sales commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline from changes in interest rates. In the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held for sale portfolio. Futures and forward sale commitment positions are used to protect the Company from the risk of such adverse changes. The change in value of the hedging contracts is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the change in value of specific assets and liabilities over the life of the hedge relationship. Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers. Positions with similar characteristics are used to offset the market risk and minimize income statement volatility associated with this portfolio. Those instruments used to service customers are entered into the trading account with changes in value recorded in the income statement. Refer to Note 14 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities of the consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of Regions year end derivatives positions in the trading portfolio. Brokerage and Market Making Activity Morgan Keegans business activities expose it to market risk, including its securities inventory positions and securities held for investment. Morgan Keegan trades for its own account in corporate and tax exempt securities and U.S. government, agency and guaranteed securities. Most of these transactions are entered into to facilitate the execution of customers orders to buy or sell these securities. In addition, it trades certain equity securities in order to make a market in these securities. Morgan Keegans trading activities require the commitment of capital. All principal transactions place the subsidiarys capital at risk. Profits and losses are dependent upon the skills of employees and market fluctuations. In some cases, in order to economically hedge the risks of carrying inventory, Morgan Keegan enters into a low level of activity involving U.S. Treasury note futures. Morgan Keegan, as part of its normal brokerage activities, assumes short positions on securities. The establishment of short positions exposes Morgan Keegan to off balance sheet risk in the event that prices increase, as it may be obligated to cover such positions at a loss. Morgan Keegan manages its exposure to these instruments by entering into offsetting or other positions in a variety of financial instruments. Morgan Keegan will occasionally economically hedge a portion of its long proprietary inventory position through the use of short positions in financial future contracts, which are included in securities sold, not yet purchased at market value. At December 31, 2004, Morgan Keegan had no outstanding futures contracts. In the normal course of business, Morgan Keegan enters into underwriting and forward and future commitments. At December 31, 2004, the contract amounts of futures contracts were $22 million to purchase and $228 million to sell U.S. Government and municipal securities. Morgan Keegan typically settles its position by entering into equal but opposite contracts and, as such, the contract amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Settlement of the transactions relating to such commitments are not expected to have a material effect on Regions consolidated financial position. Transactions involving future settlement give rise to market risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change in the market value of a particular financial instrument. Regions exposure to market risk is determined by a number of factors, including the size, composition and diversification of positions held, the absolute and relative levels of interest rates, and market volatility. 49 Table of Contents Interest rate risk at Morgan Keegan arises from the exposure of holding interest sensitive financial instruments such as government, corporate and municipal bonds and certain preferred equities. Morgan Keegan manages its exposure to interest rate risk by setting and monitoring limits and, where feasible, entering into offsetting positions in securities with similar interest rate risk characteristics. Securities inventories are marked to market, and accordingly there are no unrecorded gains or losses in value. While a significant portion of the securities inventories have contractual maturities in excess of five years, these inventories, on average, turn over in excess of twelve times per year. Accordingly, the exposure to interest rate risk inherent in Morgan Keegans securities inventories is less than that of similar financial instruments held by firms in other industries. Morgan Keegans equity securities inventories are exposed to risk of loss in the event of unfavorable price movements. The equity securities inventories are marked to market and there are no unrecorded gains or losses. Morgan Keegan is also subject to credit risk arising from non performance by trading counterparties, customers, and issuers of debt securities owned. This risk is managed by imposing and monitoring position limits, monitoring trading counterparties, reviewing security concentrations, holding and marking to market collateral and conducting business through clearing organizations that guarantee performance. Morgan Keegan regularly participates in the trading of some derivative securities for its customers; however, this activity does not involve Morgan Keegan acquiring a position or commitment in these products and this trading is not a significant portion of Morgan Keegans business. To manage trading risks arising from interest rate and equity price risks, Regions uses a Value at Risk (VAR) model to measure the potential fair value the Company could lose on its trading positions given a specified statistical confidence level and time to liquidate time horizon. Regions assesses market risk at a 99% confidence level over a one day holding period. Regions primary VAR model is based upon a variance covariance approach with delta gamma approximations for non linear securities. For fixed income securities and equities, the Bloomberg Trading System VAR analytics are used. For interest rate derivatives the Company implements its VAR analysis through the OpenLink trading system. The end of period VAR was approximately $407,000 as of December 31, 2004, and approximately $903,000 as of December 31, 2003. Maximum daily VAR utilization during 2004 was $1.5 million and average daily VAR during the same period was $605,000. Provision For Loan Losses The provision for loan losses is used to fund the allowance for loan losses. Actual loan losses, net of recoveries, are charged directly to the allowance. The expense recorded each year is a reflection of managements judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance. For an analysis and discussion of the allowance for loan losses, refer to the section entitled Financial Condition Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses. The provision for loan losses totaled $127.5 million (.41% of average loans), in 2002, a $37.9 million decrease compared to the prior year. The lower provision was due to lower loan losses in 2002 and managements assessment of current economic conditions. The 2003 provision for loan losses was decreased to $121.5 million (.39% of average loans) due to lower loan losses, lower levels of nonperforming loans and managements evaluation of current economic factors. During 2004, the provision for loan losses increased to $128.5 million (.29% of average loans) due to higher loan losses and managements evaluation of current economic factors. The resulting year end allowance for loan losses increased $300.7 million ($303.1 million added in connection with the Union Planters transaction) to $754.7 million. 50 Table of Contents Non Interest Income Brokerage and Investment Banking Brokerage and investment income decreased 3% and totaled $535.3 million in 2004, compared to $552.7 million in 2003 and $499.7 million in 2002. Brokerage and investment income is significantly affected by economic and market conditions. The slight decline in brokerage and investment income in 2004 resulted from the slow down in the record levels of fixed income production in prior years not being completely offset by improved private client, equity capital markets and investment advisory fees in 2004. As of December 31, 2004, Morgan Keegan employed approximately 1,000 financial advisors. Customer assets, under management, totaled approximately $48.5 billion at year end 2004, compared to approximately $40.4 billion at year end 2003. The addition of Morgan Keegan in 2001 significantly diversified Regions revenue stream. Non interest income, net of security gains, as a percent of total revenue equaled 42% in 2004, compared to 46% in 2003 and 43% in 2002. Morgan Keegan contributed $83.6 million to net income in 2004. Revenues from the private client division totaled $228.7 million, or 31% of Morgan Keegans total revenue in 2004, and was the top revenue producing line of business. This line of business benefited from improved equity markets and two closed end fund offerings in 2004. Fixed income capital markets and equity capital markets revenue totaled $188.0 million and $70.0 million, respectively. The investment advisory services division produced $92.8 million of revenue in 2004. Revenues generated by each division are included in various line items in the table below. In addition, beginning in 2003, Regions Morgan Keegan Trust division, which produced revenue of $87.0 million in 2004, is included with Morgan Keegan. Although Regions Morgan Keegan trust division is included with Morgan Keegan, all trust income is reported as a separate item in the consolidated statements of income (see next section titled Trust Income for discussion of changes in trust income). Prior period 2002 information has been adjusted as well for comparative purposes. The following table shows the components of the contribution by Morgan Keegan for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002.

Morgan Keegan Breakout of Revenue by Division Year Ended December 31, Fixed Income Equity Regions Private Capital Capital MK Investment Interest Client Markets Markets Trust Advisory And Other (dollar amounts in thousands) 2004 Gross revenue $ 228,693 $ 188,031 $ 69,971 $ 86,972 $ 92,835 $ 60,696 Percent of gross revenue 31.4 % 25.9 % 9.6 % 12.0 % 12.8 % 8.3 % 2003 Gross revenue $ 194,091 $ 254,177 $ 64,155 $ 60,279 $ 68,668 $ 53,069 Percent of gross revenue 27.9 % 36.6 % 9.2 % 8.7 % 9.9 % 7.8 % 2002 Gross revenue $ 173,276 $ 228,287 $ 55,708 $ 63,584 $ 57,032 $ 55,791 Percent of gross revenue 27.3 % 36.0 % 8.8 % 10.0 % 9.0 % 8.9 % Trust Income Trust income increased 47% in 2004, 12% in 2003 and 10% in 2002. The increase in 2004 was driven by the addition of trust accounts from Union Planters. In addition, trust fees are also affected by the securities markets, as many trust fees are calculated as a percentage of trust asset values. In 2004, 2003 and 2002, better performance in the financial markets and increases in trust assets contributed to higher trust fees. Service Charges on Deposit Accounts Service charge income increased 45% in 2004 and 4% in 2003 and 2002. The addition of new accounts added in connection with the Union Planters transaction resulted in the significant increase in 2004. Increases in the number of deposit accounts, management initiatives and standardization in the pricing of certain deposit accounts and related services were the primary drivers of increases in 2003 and 2002. Mortgage Servicing and Origination Fees The primary source of this category of income is Regions mortgage banking divisions, Regions Mortgage and EquiFirst. In 2004, Regions Mortgage was combined with the Union Planters mortgage division. Regions Mortgages primary business and source of income is the origination and servicing of mortgage loans for long term investors. EquiFirst typically originates mortgage loans which are sold to third party investors with servicing released. Net gains or losses related to the sale of mortgage loans are included in other non interest income. In 2004, mortgage servicing and origination fees increased 32%, from $97.4 million in 2003 to $128.8 million in 2004. Origination and servicing fees increased in 2004 due to volume and servicing assets added from the Union Planters mortgage division. At December 31, 2004, Regions servicing portfolio totaled $39.4 billion and included approximately 445,000 loans. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the servicing portfolio totaled $16.1 billion and $17.3 billion, respectively. The increase in the servicing portfolio in 2004 resulted from the addition of the Union Planters mortgage division, partially offset by certain divestitures of out of footprint mortgage servicing rights as well as relatively high levels of prepayments. The decline in the servicing portfolio during 2003 resulted from high levels of prepayments due to the low interest rate environment driving record mortgage refinance activity, partially offset by higher levels of production in 2003. 52 Table of Contents In 2003, mortgage servicing and origination fees increased 8%, from $90.0 million in 2002 to $97.4 million in 2003. Origination fees increased in 2003 due to the significant mortgage activity resulting from the historically low interest rate environment. Servicing fees were lower in 2003 as compared to 2002 due to a smaller servicing portfolio in 2003. In 2002, mortgage servicing and origination fees increased 4%, from $86.9 million in 2001. Origination fees increased in 2002 due to an increase in the number of loans closed as the result of lower mortgage interest rates. Servicing fees were lower in 2002 as compared to 2001 due to a smaller servicing portfolio in 2002. Regions Mortgage and EquiFirst, through their retail, correspondent lending, and wholesale operations, produced mortgage loans totaling $10.8 billion in 2004, $9.4 billion in 2003 and $6.6 billion in 2002. Regions Mortgage and EquiFirst produce loans from 246 offices in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. A summary of mortgage servicing rights is presented as follows. The balances shown represent the original amounts capitalized, less accumulated amortization and valuation adjustments, for the right to service mortgage loans that are owned by other investors. The amortization of mortgage servicing rights is included in other non interest expense. The carrying values of mortgage servicing rights are affected by various factors, including prepayments of the underlying mortgages. A significant change in prepayments of mortgages in the servicing portfolio could result in significant changes in the valuation adjustments. 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Balance at beginning of year $ 166,346 $ 147,487 $ 140,369 Added in connection with acquisition 352,574 0 0 Sale of servicing assets (68,795 ) 0 0 Amounts capitalized 70,745 60,918 40,974 Amortization (62,817 ) (42,059 ) (33,856 ) $ 458,053 $ 166,346 $ 147,487 Valuation allowance (61,500 ) (39,500 ) (40,500 ) Balance at end of year $ 396,553 $ 126,846 $ 106,987 Securities Gains Regions reported net gains of $63.1 million from the sale of available for sale securities in 2004, as compared to net gains of $25.7 million in 2003 and $51.7 million in 2002. These gains were primarily related to the sale of agency and mortgage related securities, used to economically hedge MSR and were sold to offset impairment charges related to mortgage servicing assets. Other Income The components of other income consist mainly of fees and commissions, insurance premiums, customer derivative fees, factoring fees, employment service fees and gains related to the sale of mortgage loans. Fee and commission income increased 44% in 2004 due to increased business activity related to the Union Planters merger including standby letters of credit, credit card fees, money orders, cashiers checks and other banking fees. Fees and commissions increased in 2003 primarily due to higher fees from standby letters of credit and higher revenue from credit card fees. Insurance premium and commission income increased 13% in 2004 and 16% in 2003, due primarily to increased revenues in the commercial property and casualty business. In 2002, insurance and commission income increased 49% due primarily to the acquisition of ICT Group, LLC. This income results primarily from the sale of property and casualty, liability and workers compensation insurance to commercial customers as well as credit life and accident and health insurance to consumer loan customers. 53 Table of Contents Regions customer derivative division primarily assists existing commercial customers with capital market products including interest rate swaps, caps and floors. Typically, Regions enters into offsetting derivative positions limiting its exposure related to customer derivative products. These exposures are marked to market on a daily basis. Capital market income totaled $7.8 million in 2004, $21.9 million in 2003 and $14.3 million in 2002. Customer derivative division revenue declined in 2004 due to lower volumes driven by slower commercial loan growth and a less favorable interest rate environment for customer derivative business. Regions operates a receivables based factoring and related fee based credit, collection and management information services subsidiary, serving small and medium sized clients. This subsidiary, acquired in connection with the Union Planters merger, produced fee income of $18.5 million in 2004. A professional employment service subsidiary was also added in connection with the Union Planters transaction. Services provided include insurance and employee benefits management, safety and risk assessment services, human resource administration and related compliance services. This subsidiary generated fee income of $26.1 million in 2004. In 2004, gains related to the sale of mortgage loans held for sale totaled $128.8 million ($124.9 million related to EquiFirst and $3.9 million related to Regions Mortgage). For the years ended December 31, 2003, and December 31, 2002, gains totaled $107.0 million and $66.5 million, respectively. Non Interest Expense The main components of non interest expense are salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy expense, furniture and equipment expenses and other non interest expense. The following table presents a summary of non interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Year Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 (in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits $ 1,425,075 $ 1,095,781 $ 1,005,099 Net occupancy expense 160,060 105,847 97,924 Furniture and equipment expense 101,977 81,347 90,818 Other expenses 776,194 510,864 530,294 Total $ 2,463,306 $ 1,793,839 $ 1,724,135 Total non interest expense increased $669.5 million, or 37%, in 2004, due primarily to the expense base added by the merger with Union Planters. In 2003, total non interest expense increased 4% due primarily to increased levels of business activity and new branch offices. Also impacting comparisons between periods are merger related expenses, impairment charges related to mortgage servicing rights, losses related to prepayment of debt and costs related to damage caused by the four destructive gulf coast hurricanes of 2004. The following tables show the impact on the major components of non interest expense of merger related expenses, impairment charges for mortgage servicing assets, losses for prepayment of debt and hurricane related costs. Management believes the following tables are useful in evaluating trends in non interest expense. 54 Table of Contents For further discussion of non interest expense, refer to the following discussion of each component of non interest expense. 2004 Non Interest Expense Less: Merger Related, Debt Retirement and MSR Impairment As Reported Charges As Adjusted (in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits $ 1,425,075 $ 16,296 $ 1,408,779 Net occupancy expense 160,060 1,725 158,335 Furniture and equipment expense 101,977 169 101,808 Other expenses 776,194 98,569 677,625 Total $ 2,463,306 $ 116,759 $ 2,346,547 In 2004, merger related and disaster charges totaled $55.1 million, impairment charges on mortgage servicing rights totaled $22.0 million and losses on prepayment of higher cost debt ($1.1 billion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances) totaled $39.6 million. 2003 Non Interest Expense Less: Debt Retirement and MSR Impairment As Reported Charges As Adjusted (in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits $ 1,095,781 $ 0 $ 1,095,781 Net occupancy expense 105,847 0 105,847 Furniture and equipment expense 81,347 0 81,347 Other expenses 510,864 19,580 491,284 Total $ 1,793,839 $ 19,580 $ 1,774,259 In 2003, a net recapture of $1.0 million on mortgage servicing rights was recorded as a result of changes in interest rates and a slowdown in prepayment speeds. Also in 2003, Regions chose to pay off $650 million of Federal Home loan Bank advances early, resulting in a $20.6 million charge from prepayment of this debt. 2002 Non Interest Expense Less: Debt Retirement and MSR Impairment As Reported Charges As Adjusted (in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits $ 1,005,099 $ 0 $ 1,005,099 Net occupancy expense 97,924 0 97,924 Furniture and equipment expense 90,818 0 90,818 Other expenses 530,294 41,912 488,382 Total $ 1,724,135 $ 41,912 $ 1,682,223 In 2002, impairment charges on mortgage servicing rights totaled $36.7 million and losses on prepayment of higher costs debt ($250 million of Federal Home Loan Bank advances) totaled $5.2 million. 55 Table of Contents In connection with the integration of Regions and Union Planters, Regions has and will continue to incur merger related expenses throughout the integration process. Merger related expenses include costs incurred in connection with the merger, integration and restructuring activities, including retention and severance costs, professional fees incurred with integration activities, contract buyouts, lease termination penalties, loss on disposals of duplicate facilities and other direct and incremental costs related to the transaction. Costs incurred in connection with the merger, integration and restructuring activities are expected to be funded from cash flows from operations. Salaries and Employee Benefits Total salaries and benefits increased 30% in 2004, 9% in 2003 and 17% in 2002. Excluding $16.3 million of merger related charges, salaries and benefits increased 29% due to the addition of approximately 10,000 Union Planters associates. Salaries and benefits were higher in 2003, as compared to 2002, due primarily to higher incentive costs associated with Morgan Keegan and mortgage banking. Increased production and achievement of other goals at Morgan Keegan, Regions Mortgage and EquiFirst resulted in increased incentive compensation in 2003. In addition to increased incentive compensation in 2003, normal merit and promotional adjustments, and higher benefit costs resulted in increased salaries and benefits expense in 2003. At December 31, 2004, Regions had approximately 26,000 full time equivalent employees, compared to approximately 16,000 at December 31, 2003 and 2002. The increase in employees in 2004 resulted primarily from personnel added with the 2004 Union Planters transaction. Salaries, excluding benefits, totaled $830.8 million in 2004, compared to $598.5 million in 2003 and $583.2 million in 2002. Increased salaries in 2004 resulted from higher employment levels, while higher salary levels in 2003 and 2002 were primarily the result of normal merit and promotional adjustments. Regions provides employees who meet established employment requirements with a benefits package which includes 401(k), pension, profit sharing, and medical, life and disability insurance plans. The total cost to Regions for fringe benefits, including payroll taxes, equals approximately 29% of salaries. Regions 401(k) plan includes a company match of employee contributions. At December 31, 2004, this match ranged from 150% to 200% of the employee contribution (up to 3% of compensation) based on length of service and is invested in Regions common stock. Regions contribution to the 401(k) plan on behalf of employees totaled $25.7 million, $16.5 million, and $16.0 million in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. As part of Regions profit sharing plan, eligible employees can elect to have their profit sharing award paid in cash or contributed to their 401(k) plan. The combination of the cash payments and contributions to employee 401(k) plans was equal to approximately 1% of after tax income in 2004, and 2% in 2003 and 2002. Commissions and incentives expense increased to $381.0 million in 2004, compared to $352.1 million in 2003 and $301.3 million in 2002. The increases in commissions and incentives were primarily the result of increased participants in various incentive programs as well as higher commissions paid at Morgan Keegan and EquiFirst, which were related to increased production levels and sales goals. At Morgan Keegan, commissions and incentives are a key component of compensation, which is typical in the brokerage and investment banking industry. In general, incentives continue to be used to reward employees for selling products and services, for productivity improvements and for achievement of corporate financial goals. Regions long term incentive plan provides for the granting of stock options, restricted stock and performance shares (see Note 20 Stock Option and Long Term Incentive Plans to the consolidated financial statements). Pension expense totaled $22.5 million in 2004, $19.8 million in 2003 and $7.1 million in 2002. Higher pension costs in 2004 and 2003 are the result of lower asset returns and discount rate assumptions. Pension expense in 2005 is expected to be approximately $19.6 million. Payroll taxes increased 37% in 2004, 3% in 2003 and 19% in 2002. Increases in the number of associates combined with the increase in the Social Security tax base and increased salary levels were the primary reasons for increased payroll taxes. 56 Table of Contents Group insurance expense increased 56% in 2004, 12% in 2003 and 1% in 2002. The increases were the result of increased levels of covered employees and higher claims cost. Excluding the impact of the merger with Union Planters, group insurance expense would have increased 11%. Net Occupancy Expense Net occupancy expense includes rents, depreciation and amortization, utilities, maintenance, insurance, taxes and other expenses of premises occupied by Regions and its affiliates. Regions affiliates operate offices primarily in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Missouri, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas. Net occupancy expense increased 51% in 2004, 8% in 2003 and 13% in 2002 due to acquisitions, new and acquired branch offices, rising price levels, and increased business activity. Furniture and Equipment Expense Furniture and equipment expense increased 25% in 2004 due to acquisitions, rising price levels and expenses related to equipment for new branch offices. Furniture and equipment expense decreased 10% in 2003 due primarily to lower expenses related to computer equipment. In 2002, furniture and equipment expense increased 4%. These increases resulted from expenses related to equipment for new branch offices, and increased depreciation and service contract expenses associated with other new back office and branch equipment. Other Expenses The significant components of other expense include legal and other professional fees, other non credit losses, amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights, amortization of identifiable intangibles and computer and other outside services. Increases in this category of expense generally resulted from acquisitions, expanded programs, increased business activity and rising price levels. Other expenses included $98.6 million in 2004, $19.6 million in 2003 and $41.9 million in 2002 of costs related to the merger and other charges, previously discussed. Please refer to Note 16 Other Income and Expense to the consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the significant components of other expense. Legal and other professional fees increased significantly in 2004 as compared to 2003 and 2002 due to costs incurred related to the merger and integration with Union Planters. These costs include fees paid to attorneys, accountants and other professionals involved in the Union Planters transaction as well as costs incurred in the ordinary course of business. Other non credit losses primarily include charges for items unrelated to the extension of credit such as fraud losses, litigation losses, write downs of other real estate, insurance claims and miscellaneous losses. Other non credit losses increased in 2004 due to higher losses related to litigation, fraud and other expenses related to increased business activity added by the Union Planters merger. Other non credit losses decreased in 2003 from levels in 2002. The 2003 decrease was primarily related to lower losses related to litigation. Amortization of mortgage servicing rights increased in 2004 and 2003. Accelerated amortization expense, due to the low interest rate environment and increased prepayments of the underlying mortgages, combined with the addition of servicing rights added by the Union Planters merger, resulted in additional amortization expense in 2004 and 2003. Amortization of identifiable intangible assets increased significantly in 2004. The increase related to amortization of intangible assets (primarily core deposit intangibles) recorded in connection with the Union Planters merger. In addition, Regions incurred in 2004, a $39.6 million charge on the early extinguishment of $1.1 billion of long term Federal Home Loan Bank advances, as well as $22.0 million of mortgage servicing rights impairment. 57 Table of Contents In the second quarter of 2003 Regions incurred charges of $19.0 million related to the impairment of mortgage servicing rights. In the third quarter of 2003, $20.0 million of impairment recapture on mortgage servicing rights was recorded as a result of changes in interest rates and a slowdown in prepayment speeds. Also in 2003, in connection with the prepayment of $650 million of Federal Home Loan Bank advances ($350 million classified as short term and $300 million classified as long term), Regions incurred a $20.6 million loss on early extinguishment of debt. In 2002, Regions incurred charges totaling $36.7 million related to the impairment of mortgage servicing rights due primarily to the historically low interest rate environment, as well as a $5.2 million charge related to the prepayment of $250 million of Federal Home Loan Bank advances. Applicable Income Tax Regions provision for income taxes increased 35% in 2004 and 4% in 2003. These increases were caused primarily by a 29% increase in income before taxes in 2004 and a 5% increase in 2003. Regions effective income tax rates were 29.9% for 2004, 28.5% for 2003 and 28.7% for 2002. The effective tax rate increased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to higher levels of income before taxes resulting from the merger with Union Planters and an increase in state taxes, partially offset by a higher level of tax credits realized. From time to time Regions engages in business plans that may also have an effect on its tax liabilities. While Regions has obtained the opinion of advisors that the tax aspects of these plans should prevail, examination of Regions income tax returns or changes in tax law may impact the tax benefits of these plans. Periodically, Regions invests in pass through investment vehicles that generate tax credits, principally low income housing and non conventional fuel source credits, which directly reduce Regions federal income tax liability. Congress has legislated these tax credit programs to encourage capital inflows to these investment vehicles. The amount of tax benefit recognized from these tax credits was $35.4 million in 2004 and $25.8 million in 2003. During the fourth quarter of 2000, Regions recapitalized a mortgage related subsidiary by raising Tier 2 capital, which resulted in a reduction in taxable income of that subsidiary attributable to Regions. The reduction in the taxable income of this subsidiary attributable to Regions is expected to result in a lower effective tax rate applicable to the consolidated taxable income before taxes of Regions for future periods. The impact on Regions effective tax rate applicable to consolidated income before taxes of the reduction in the subsidiarys taxable income attributable to Regions will, however, depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to: the amount of assets in the subsidiary, the yield of the assets in the subsidiary, the cost of funding the subsidiary, possible loan losses in the subsidiary, the level of expenses of the subsidiary, the level of income attributable to obligations of states and political subdivisions, and various other factors. The amount of federal and state tax benefits recognized related to the recapitalized subsidiary was $42.9 million in 2004 ($33.6 million federal) and $43.7 million in 2003 ($34.5 million federal). Regions has segregated a portion of its investment securities and intellectual property into separate legal entities in order to, among other business purposes, protect such intangible assets from inappropriate claims of Regions creditors, and to maximize the return on such assets by the professional and focused management thereof. Regions has recognized state tax benefits related to these legal entities of $17.4 million in 2004 and $13.8 million in 2003. Regions federal and state income tax returns for the years 1998 through 2003 are open for review and examination by governmental authorities. In the normal course of these examinations, Regions is subject to challenges from governmental authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. Regions has received notices of proposed adjustments relating to taxes due for the years 1999 through 2001, which include proposed adjustments relating to an increase in taxable income of the mortgage related subsidiary discussed above. Regions believes adequate provision for income taxes has been recorded for all years open for review and intends to vigorously contest the proposed adjustments. To the extent that final resolution of the proposed adjustments results in significantly different conclusions from Regions current assessment of the proposed adjustments, Regions effective tax rate in any given financial reporting period may be materially different from its current effective tax rate. 58 Table of Contents Managements determination of the realization of the deferred tax asset is based upon managements judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing, nature and amount of future income earned by certain subsidiaries and the implementation of various plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset. Management believes that the subsidiaries will generate sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax benefits. However, management does not believe that it is more likely than not to realize all of its capital loss carryforwards nor all of its state net operating loss carryforwards. Accordingly, it has established valuation allowances of $63.8 million and $7.6 million, respectively, against such benefits. Note 17 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information about the provision for income taxes. Effects Of Inflation The majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature; therefore, a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies, which have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. However, inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio. Inflation also affects other expenses that tend to rise during periods of general inflation. Management believes the most significant impact of inflation on financial results is Regions ability to react to changes in interest rates. As discussed previously, management is attempting to maintain an essentially balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect net interest income from being affected by wide interest rate fluctuations.
