Item 7. Managements Discussion And Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation Introduction General The following discussion and financial information is presented to aid in understanding Regions Financial Corporations (Regions or the Company) financial position and results of operations. The emphasis of this discussion will be on the years 2003, 2004 and 2005; in addition, financial information for prior years will also be presented when appropriate. Certain amounts in prior year financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation. On July 1, 2004, Regions merged with Union Planters Corporation (Union Planters) headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. The combination with Union Planters added approximately $35.7 billion of assets, $22.3 billion of loans, and $22.9 billion of deposits. This transaction was accounted for as a purchase of Union Planters by Regions and accordingly prior period financial statements have not been restated, except certain share and per share amounts related to the exchange of Regions common stock. Union Planters results of operations were included in Regions results beginning July 1, 2004. Comparisons with prior periods are significantly impacted by the merger with Union Planters (see Note 18 Business Combinations to the consolidated financial statements). Regions primary business is providing traditional commercial and retail banking services to customers throughout its geographic footprint. Regions banking subsidiary, Regions Bank, has operations in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. In 2005, Regions banking operations, excluding trust activities, contributed approximately $789.0 million to consolidated net income. In addition to providing traditional commercial and retail banking services, Regions provides other financial services in the fields of investment banking, asset management, trust, mutual funds, securities brokerage, mortgage banking, insurance, commercial accounts receivable factoring and other specialty financing. Regions provides investment banking and brokerage services through 281 offices of Morgan Keegan & Company, Inc. (Morgan Keegan). Morgan Keegan contributed approximately $101.7 million to net income in 2005, including trust activities. Regions mortgage banking operations, Regions Mortgage and EquiFirst Corporation (EquiFirst), provide residential mortgage loan origination and servicing activities for customers and contributed approximately $76.0 million to net income in 2005. Regions Mortgage serviced approximately $37.2 billion in mortgage loans as of December 31, 2005. Regions provides full line insurance brokerage services primarily through Rebsamen Insurance, Inc., one of the 50 largest insurance brokers in the country. Credit life insurance services for customers are provided through other Regions affiliates. Insurance activities contributed approximately $15.8 million to net income in 2005. Regions profitability, like that of many other financial institutions, is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income and non interest income sources. Net interest income is the difference between the interest income Regions receives on earning assets, such as loans and securities, and the interest expense Regions pays on interest bearing liabilities, principally deposits and borrowings. Regions net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its liabilities. Non interest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts, trust and securities brokerage activities, mortgage origination and servicing, insurance and other customer services which Regions provides. Results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses and non interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits, occupancy and other operating expenses, including income taxes. Economic conditions, competition and the monetary and fiscal policies of the Federal government in general, significantly affect financial institutions, including Regions. Lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by the level of business spending and investment, consumer income, spending and savings, capital market activities, competition among financial institutions, customer preferences, interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in Regions primary market areas. 17 Regions business strategy has been and continues to be focused on providing a competitive mix of products and services, delivering quality customer service and maintaining a branch distribution network with offices in convenient locations. The Companys principal market areas are located in the states of Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. Morgan Keegan also operates offices in Massachusetts and New York. 2005 Highlights Regions most significant accomplishment in 2005 was the successful three phase conversion of more than 700 Union Planters bank branches to Regions banking systems. The integration of systems was accomplished ahead of the original schedule and resulted in minimal negative impact to Regions customers. The integration is expected to result in improved returns through increased operational efficiencies and strengthened customer relationships. Regions reported net income available to common shareholders of $2.15 per diluted share in 2005, including a reduction of $.24 per diluted share related to $115.4 million (net of tax) in merger and storm related expenses. Net income available to common shareholders was $2.19 per diluted share in 2004. Net interest income for 2005 was $2.8 billion, compared to $2.1 billion in 2004. The net interest margin for 2005 was 3.91%, up from 3.66% in 2004. The increase in the net interest margin was due primarily to favorable balance sheet positioning in a rising interest rate environment during 2005; Regions, being in a slightly asset sensitive balance sheet position, benefited from rising interest rates during 2005, as increases in asset yields outpaced increases in interest bearing liability costs. Additionally, a shift in the mix of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities benefited the Company. Loans, typically Regions highest yielding asset, increased slightly as a percentage of total earning assets. Low cost core deposits comprised a larger percentage of interest bearing liabilities, resulting from marketing campaigns targeting such products, as well as an influx of low cost deposits during the last two quarters of 2005 in Hurricane Katrina impacted areas. As of December 31, 2005, interest rate sensitivity analysis indicated Regions balance sheet remains in a slightly asset sensitive position. Net charge offs totaled $136.2 million, or 0.23%, of average loans in 2005, compared to 0.29% in 2004. Non performing assets decreased $45.4 million to $406.9 million at December 31, 2005. Non interest income (excluding security gains/losses) totaled 39% of total revenue (tax equivalent basis) in 2005, as Regions continued to benefit from a diversified revenue steam. Brokerage and investment banking revenues increased in 2005, attributable to strong private client, equity capital markets, and investment advisory income streams during the year. Service charges on deposit accounts increased significantly in 2005, due primarily to deposit accounts added from the Union Planters merger. Residential mortgage servicing and origination fees were higher in 2005, due to business activity added in connection with the Union Planters merger, as well as a relatively low interest rate environment. Non interest expense totaled $3.0 billion in 2005 compared to $2.5 billion in 2004. Included in non interest expense in 2005 are merger and storm related charges of $176.8 million. Regions incurred merger related expenses throughout the merger integration process incident to the Regions and Union Planters merger. Through the integration of Regions and Union Planters, Regions expects continued realization of efficiencies in the banking unit, as well as other lines of business. Regions realized $135 million in cumulative cost savings in 2005 in connection with the merger. Regions intends to continue to invest in many areas of the franchise, including personnel, technology and product delivery channels to increase revenue and improve efficiencies while continuing to provide superior customer service. On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast as a powerful Category 3 hurricane, causing significant flood and wind damage and loss of life, property, power, and income along the coastal areas of Louisiana (including New Orleans), Mississippi, and Alabama. At December 31, 2005, only 11 of the 190 Regions branches affected by Hurricane Katrina remained closed due to the damage sustained from the hurricane and subsequent flooding. As of December 31, 2005, Regions had approximately $1.2 billion in 18 outstanding loans in the most significantly impacted areas. As a result of this disaster, Regions expects some continued impact to certain revenue streams due to business interruptions caused by this disaster. In addition, incremental costs are expected to be incurred related to the disaster, a significant portion of which is expected to be covered by insurance. Critical Accounting Policies In preparing financial information, management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses for the periods shown. The accounting principles followed by Regions and the methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and general banking practices. Estimates and assumptions most significant to Regions are related primarily to allowance for loan losses, intangibles (excess purchase price, other identifiable intangible assets and mortgage serving rights) and income taxes, and are summarized in the following discussion and notes to the consolidated financial statements. Allowance for Loan Losses Managements determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, which is based on the factors and risk identification procedures discussed in the following pages, requires the use of judgments and estimates that may change in the future. Changes in the factors used by management to determine the adequacy of the allowance, or the availability of new information, could cause the allowance for loan losses to be increased or decreased in future periods. For example, management has used judgments and estimates in its determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses related to the impact of Hurricane Katrina. The availability of additional or different information affecting customers in the Katrina impacted areas could cause the allowance for loan losses to be increased or decreased in future periods. In addition, bank regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, may require that additions be made to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments and estimates. Intangible Assets Regions intangible assets consist primarily of excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses (excess purchase price), other identifiable intangible assets (primarily core deposit intangibles) and amounts capitalized for the right to service mortgage loans. Regions excess purchase price is tested for impairment annually, or more often if events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist. Adverse changes in the economic environment, operations of acquired business units, or other factors could result in a decline in implied fair value of excess purchase price. If the implied fair value is less than the carrying amount, a loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to implied fair value. Other identifiable intangible assets, primarily core deposit intangibles, are reviewed at least annually for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset, such as loss of core deposits, increased competition or adverse changes in the economy. To the extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable, an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount to the fair value. For purposes of evaluating mortgage servicing impairment, Regions must estimate the value of its mortgage servicing rights (MSR). MSR do not trade in an active market with readily observable market prices. Although sales of MSR do occur, the exact terms and conditions of sales may not be readily available. As a result, Regions stratifies its mortgage servicing portfolio on the basis of certain risk characteristics, including loan type and contractual note rate, and values its MSR using discounted cash flow modeling techniques, which require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows, taking into consideration historical and forecasted mortgage loan prepayment rates and discount rates. Changes in interest rates, prepayment speeds or other factors could result in impairment of the servicing asset and a charge against earnings to reduce the recorded carrying amount. Based on a hypothetical sensitivity analysis, Regions estimates that a reduction in the primary mortgage market rates of 25 basis points and 50 basis points 19 would reduce the December 31, 2005 fair value of MSR by 8% ($30 million) and 15% ($60 million), respectively. Income Taxes Managements determination of the realization of the deferred tax asset is based upon managements judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing and amount of future income earned by certain subsidiaries and the implementation of various tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset. Management believes that the subsidiaries will generate sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax benefits. Regions 1998 to 2004 consolidated federal income tax returns are open for examination. From time to time Regions engages in business plans that may also have an effect on its tax liabilities. While Regions has obtained the opinion of advisors that the tax aspects of these plans should prevail, examination of Regions income tax returns or changes in tax law may impact these plans and resulting provisions for income taxes. For example, as a result of normal examinations of Regions income tax returns, Regions has received notices of proposed adjustments relating to taxes due for certain years. Regions believes that adequate provisions for income taxes have been recorded and intends to vigorously contest the proposed adjustments. To the extent, however, that final resolution of the proposed adjustments results in significantly different conclusions from Regions current assessment of the proposed adjustments, Regions effective tax rate in any given financial reporting period may be materially different from its current effective tax rate. Acquisitions The acquisitions of banks and other financial service companies historically have contributed significantly to Regions growth. The acquisitions of other financial service companies have also allowed Regions to better diversify its revenue stream and to offer additional products and services to its customers. Regions, from time to time, evaluates potential bank and non bank acquisition candidates; however, no transactions were pending at December 31, 2005. During 2005, Regions completed acquisitions of an oil and gas valuation and brokerage entity, as well as various insurance production activities. Regions paid approximately $7.2 million in cash and recorded $5.6 million in identifiable intangible assets, as well as $1.5 million of excess purchase price, related to these acquisitions. On July 1, 2004, Regions completed its merger with Union Planters, headquartered in Memphis, Tennessee. Union Planters provided traditional commercial and retail banking services and other financial services in the fields of mortgage banking, insurance, trust, securities brokerage and investments, professional employment services and specialty financing. The combination with Union Planters added $35.7 billion in assets, $22.3 billion in loans and $22.9 billion in deposits, and significantly expanded Regions geographic footprint as well as its customer base. Through the merger, Regions expanded its banking presence into new markets in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Mississippi and Missouri and strengthened its banking presence in existing markets in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas. Additionally in 2004, Regions acquired Evergreen Timber Investment Management (ETIM), adding approximately $20 million in assets. ETIM manages timber assets for third parties. In 2003, Regions consummated the purchase of three branches from Inter Savings Bank, FSB, which strengthened its community banking franchise in central Florida. These branches combined added $185 million in assets, $5 million in loans and $185 million in deposits. Financial Condition Regions financial condition depends primarily on the quality and nature of its assets, liabilities and capital structure, market and economic conditions, and the quality of its personnel. 20 Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses Loan Portfolio Regions primary investment is loans. At December 31, 2005, loans represented 79% of Regions earning assets. Lending at Regions is generally organized along three functional lines: commercial loans (including financial and agricultural), real estate loans and consumer loans. The composition of the portfolio by these major categories is presented below (with real estate loans further broken down between construction and mortgage loans): December 31, 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 (in thousands, net of unearned income) Commercial $ 14,728,006 $ 15,028,015 $ 9,754,588 $ 10,667,855 $ 9,727,204 Real estate construction 7,362,219 5,472,463 3,484,767 3,604,116 3,664,677 Real estate mortgage 27,034,924 27,639,913 12,977,549 11,039,552 11,309,126 Consumer 9,279,764 9,386,563 5,967,419 5,674,251 6,184,341 Total $ 58,404,913 $ 57,526,954 $ 32,184,323 $ 30,985,774 $ 30,885,348 As the above table demonstrates, over the last five years loans increased a total of $27.5 billion, a compound growth rate of 17%. In 2002, total loans increased $100 million, primarily due to growth in the commercial portfolio and partially offset by the reclassification of $1.1 billion of indirect auto loans to the loans held for sale category on September 30, 2002. Excluding the effect of the reclassification, total loans would have increased $1.2 billion, or 4%, in 2002. Loans increased $1.2 billion, or 4%, in 2003, due primarily to growth in the real estate portfolio partially offset by a decline in the commercial portfolio. Loans increased significantly in 2004 due to $22.3 billion of loans which were added by the Union Planters merger, $430 million of indirect auto loans reclassified to the loan portfolio from the loans held for sale category and internally generated loan growth. Excluding loans added from the merger and reclassification, loans increased 8% in 2004. Loans increased $878 million, or 2%, in 2005, due primarily to growth in the real estate construction portfolio, partially offset by declines in other loan categories. All major categories in the loan portfolio have increased significantly over the last five years due primarily to the merger with Union Planters during 2004. Over the last five years, commercial, financial and agricultural loans increased $5.0 billion, or 51%. Real estate construction loans increased $3.7 billion, or 101%, over the same period. Real estate mortgage loans increased $15.7 billion, or 139%, and consumer loans increased $3.1 billion, or 50%, over the last five years. In 2005, as economic conditions remained relatively steady, loan growth was generated in the real estate construction category, while other categories experienced slight declines. Average total loans were $31.5 billion in 2003, compared to $44.7 billion in 2004 and $58.0 billion in 2005. The modest internal loan growth trend experienced is the result of reduced loan demand attributable to slowing real estate market conditions, significant prepayments of mortgage loans, and management initiatives to focus on higher margin loans and increase diversification of the portfolio, combined with the reclassification of indirect auto loans in 2002. Regions anticipates modest overall loan growth in 2006. Regions residential real estate mortgage loans originated from the mortgage divisions totaled $8.9 billion at December 31, 2005, an increase of approximately $200 million from a year earlier. Included in these loans are approximately $5.7 billion of adjustable rate mortgages (ARM) and $3.2 billion of fixed rate mortgages at year end. The fixed rate residential mortgage portfolios weighted average coupon declined to 5.86% from 5.90% the previous year, while the weighted average remaining maturity increased slightly to 177 months from 170 months for 2005 and 2004, respectively. The residential ARM portfolio exhibited a yield increase with 21 rates averaging 5.65% in 2005, compared to 5.37% a year earlier. At December 31, 2005, the weighted average months to reprice was 33, down from 35 months at year end 2004. The amounts of total gross loans (excluding residential mortgages and consumer loans) outstanding at December 31, 2005, based on remaining scheduled repayments of principal, due in (1) one year or less, (2) more than one year but less than five years and (3) more than five years, are shown in the following table. The amounts due after one year are classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rates. Loans Maturing Within After One But After One Year Within Five Years Five Years Total (in thousands) Commercial, financial and agricultural $ 7,461,448 $ 5,596,959 $ 1,829,041 $ 14,887,448 Real estate construction 4,567,540 2,425,955 383,255 7,376,750 Real estate mortgage 3,509,002 6,900,551 2,596,522 13,006,075 Total $ 15,537,990 $ 14,923,465 $ 4,808,818 $ 35,270,273 Sensitivity of Loans to Changes in Interest Rates Predetermined Variable Rate Rate (in thousands) Due after one year but within five years $ 4,753,581 $ 10,169,884 Due after five years 1,976,710 2,832,108 Total $ 6,730,291 $ 13,001,992 A sound credit policy and careful, consistent credit review are vital to a successful lending program. All affiliates of Regions operate under written loan policies that attempt to maintain a consistent lending philosophy, provide sound traditional credit decisions, provide an adequate risk adjusted return and render service to the communities in which the bank branches are located. Regions lending policy generally confines loans to local customers or to national firms doing business locally. Credit reviews and loan examinations help confirm that affiliates are adhering to these loan policies. Allowance for Loan Losses Every loan carries some degree of credit risk. This risk is reflected in the consolidated financial statements by the allowance for loan losses, the amount of loans charged off and the provision for loan losses charged to operating expense. It is Regions policy that when a loss is identified, it is charged against the allowance for loan losses in the current period. The policy regarding recognition of losses requires immediate recognition of a loss if significant doubt exists as to principal repayment. Regions provision for loan losses is a reflection of managements judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses. Some of the factors considered by management in determining the amount of the provision and resulting allowance include: (1) detailed reviews of individual loans; (2) gross and net loan charge offs in the current year; (3) the current level of the allowance in relation to total loans and to historical loss levels; (4) past due and non accruing loans; (5) collateral values of properties securing loans; (6) the composition of the loan portfolio (types of loans) and risk profiles; and (7) managements analysis of economic conditions and the resulting impact on Regions loan portfolio. A coordinated effort is undertaken to identify credit losses in the loan portfolio for management purposes and to establish the loan loss provision and resulting allowance for accounting purposes. A regular, formal and ongoing loan review is conducted to identify loans with unusual risks or possible losses. Credit administration and internal audit are jointly responsible for this review, which tests the accuracy of loan gradings assigned at the individual banking offices, reviews significant portfolio segments for early identification of problems or potential problems, and tests for compliance with laws, regulations, and internal policies and procedures. This process provides information that helps in assessing the quality of the portfolio, assists in the prompt 22 identification of problems and potential problems, and aids in deciding if a loan represents a probable loss that should be recognized or a risk for which an allowance should be maintained. If it is determined that payment of interest on a loan is questionable, it is Regions policy to classify the loan as non accrual and reverse interest previously accrued on the loan against interest income. Interest on such loans is thereafter recorded on a cash basis and is included in earnings only when actually received in cash and when full payment of principal is no longer doubtful. Although it is Regions policy to immediately charge off as a loss all loan amounts judged to be uncollectible, historical experience indicates that certain losses exist in the loan portfolio that have not been specifically identified. To anticipate and provide for these inherent losses, the allowance for loan losses is established by charging the provision for loan losses expense against current earnings. No portion of the resulting allowance is in any way allocated or restricted to any individual loan or group of loans. The entire allowance is available to absorb losses from any and all loans. Regions determines its allowance for loan losses in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 114, Accounting by Creditors for Impairment of a Loan an Amendment of FASB Statements No. 5 and 15 and Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. In determining the amount of the allowance for loan losses, management uses information from its ongoing loan review process to stratify the loan portfolio into loan pools with common risk characteristics. The higher risk graded loans in the portfolio are assigned estimated amounts of loss based on several factors, including current and historical loss experience of each higher risk category, regulatory guidelines for losses in each higher risk category, and managements judgment of economic conditions and the resulting impact on the higher risk graded loans. All loans deemed to be impaired, which include all non accrual loans greater than $1 million, excluding loans to individuals, are evaluated individually. Impaired loans totaled approximately $64 million at December 31, 2005 and $95 million at December 31, 2004. The vast majority of Regions impaired loans are dependent upon collateral for repayment. For these loans, impairment is measured by evaluating collateral value as compared to the current investment in the loan. For all other loans, Regions compares the amount of estimated discounted cash flows to the investment in the loan. In the event a particular loans collateral value or discounted cash flows are not sufficient to support the collection of the investment in the loan, the loan is specifically considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses or a charge is immediately taken against the allowance for loan losses. The amount of the allowance for loan losses related to the higher risk loans was approximately 47% at December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 55% at December 31, 2004. Higher risk loans, which include impaired loans, consist of loans classified as OLEM (other loans especially mentioned) and below and loans in other loan categories that are significantly past due. In addition to establishing allowance levels for specifically identified higher risk graded loans, management determines allowance levels for all other loans in the portfolio for which historical experience indicates that losses exist. These loans are categorized by loan type and assigned estimated amounts of loss based on several factors, including current and historical loss experience of each loan type and managements judgment of economic conditions and the resulting impact on each category of loans. The amount of the allowance for loan losses related to all other loans in the portfolio for which historical experience indicates that losses exist was approximately 53% of Regions allowance for loan losses at December 31, 2005, compared to approximately 45% at December 31, 2004. The amount of the allowance related to these loans is combined with the amount of the allowance related to the higher risk graded loans to evaluate the overall level of the allowance for loan losses. In August of 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the Gulf Coast (mainly impacting Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama) as a Category 3 hurricane, causing significant flood and wind damage and loss of life, property, power, and income. Regions had approximately $1.2 billion in loans ($473 million in commercial real estate loans, $299 million in commercial and industrial loans, $186 million in consumer loans, and $198 million in mortgage loans) in the most significantly impacted areas at December 31, 2005. Approximately 50% of the consumer loans are home equity lines of credit. As part of its ongoing evaluation process at December 31, 2005, Regions has identified approximately $61 million in allowance for loan losses related to this portion of its 23 loan portfolio. As of December 31, 2005, Regions had recognized approximately $972,000 in net loan charge offs ($641,000 for commercial loans and $331,000 for retail and consumer loans) related to Hurricane Katrina. Management considers the current level of allowance for loan losses adequate to absorb probable losses on loans in the portfolio. Managements determination of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses, which is based on the factors and risk identification procedures previously discussed, requires the use of judgments and estimations that may change in the future. Changes in the factors used by management to determine the adequacy of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance for loan losses to be increased or decreased in future periods. The amount of the allowance for loan losses related to the Hurricane Katrina impacted portfolio may change in the future as additional or different information affecting customers in the Katrina impacted areas is obtained. Changes in (1) risk assessments of individual loans in this area, (2) collateral values of properties securing loans in this area, (3) levels of past due and non accruing loans in this area, (4) economic conditions in the Hurricane Katrina impacted area and (5) other factors, could result in changes in Regions allowance for loan losses in the future. In addition, bank regulatory agencies, as part of their examination process, may require that additions be made to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments and estimates. Over the last five years, the year end allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans ranged from a low of 1.31% at December 31, 2004 to a high of 1.41% at December 31, 2003 and 2002. As of December 31, 2005, the allowance as a percentage of loans was 1.34%. The following table presents information on non performing loans and real estate acquired in settlement of loans: December 31, Non Performing Assets 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 (dollar amounts in thousands) Non performing loans: Loans accounted for on a non accrual basis $ 341,177 $ 388,379 $ 250,344 $ 226,470 $ 269,764 Loans whose terms have been renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower (exclusive of non accrual loans and loans past due 90 days or more) 241 279 886 32,280 42,807 Total non performing loans $ 341,418 $ 388,658 $ 251,230 $ 258,750 $ 312,571 Real estate acquired in settlement of loans (other real estate) 65,459 63,598 52,195 59,606 40,872 Total non performing assets $ 406,877 $ 452,256 $ 303,425 $ 318,356 $ 353,443 Non performing assets as a percentage of loans and other real estate .70 % .92 % 1.05 % 1.15 % 1.29 % Loans contractually past due 90 days or more as to principal or interest payments (exclusive of non accrual loans) $ 87,523 $ 74,777 $ 35,187 $ 38,499 $ 46,845 The analysis of loan loss experience, as reflected in the following table, shows that net loan losses over the last five years ranged from a high of $136.2 million in 2005 to a low of $104.6 million in 2003. Net loan losses were $131.0 million in 2004, $111.8 million in 2002, and $126.8 million in 2001. Over the last five years, net loan losses averaged 0.31% of average loans and were 0.23% of average loans in 2005. In 2005, Regions experienced a lower charge off percentage for commercial and consumer credits, while real estate net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were flat in comparison to the prior year. Regions expects charge offs to increase slightly in 2006, although additional charge offs could be recognized as a result of higher defaults 24 related to Hurricane Katrina or the hurricane season in 2006, fraud in connection with loans we originate or lower loan production as a result of rising interest rates.

Economy of Regions primary banking markets. The Alabama economy has experienced relatively stable growth over the last several years, including substantial growth in the information technology and biotechnology sectors within Birmingham and Huntsville. Industries important in the Alabama economy include vehicle and vehicle parts manufacturing and assembly, lumber and wood products, health care services and steel production. High technology and defense related industries are important in the northern part of the state. Agriculture, particularly poultry, beef and cotton, are also important to the states economy. Tennessees economy is heavily influenced by automobile manufacturing, tourism, entertainment and recreation, health care and other service industries. With one out of four Tennesseans employed in service industries, the states economy is dependent on this sector. The economy of northern Georgia, where the majority of Regions Georgia franchise is located, is diversified with a strong presence in poultry production, carpet manufacturing, automotive manufacturing related industries, tourism, and various service sector industries. A well developed transportation system has contributed to the growth in north Georgia. This area has experienced rapid population growth and has favorable household income characteristics relative to many of Regions other markets. In the southern region of Georgia, while agriculture is important, other industries play a significant role in the economy as well. Georgia ranks as one of the nations top producers of paper and paper board products. Albany and Valdosta, Regions primary market areas in southern Georgia, are hubs for retail trade and health care for the entire south Georgia market. These markets are also home to numerous manufacturing and production facilities of Fortune 500 Companies. Florida has also experienced significant economic growth during the last several years. Tourism and space research are very important to the Florida economy, and military payrolls are significant in the panhandle area. Florida has experienced strong in migration, contributing to strong construction activity, increasing real estate values, and a growing retirement age population. Citrus fruit production is also important in the state. The Arkansas economy is supported in part by the forest products industry, due to the abundance of corporate owned forests and public forest lands. In recent years, retail trade, transportation and steel production have become increasingly important to the states economy. Natural resources are very important to the Louisiana economy. Energy and petrochemical industries play a significant role in the economy. Shipping, shipbuilding, and other transportation equipment industries are strong in the states durable goods industries. Tourism, amusement and recreation, service, and health care industries are also important to the Louisiana economy. Cotton, rice and sugarcane are among Louisianas most important agricultural commodities, while Louisianas fishing industry is one of the largest in the nation. The coastal region of Louisiana was significantly impacted by Hurricane Katrina from both an infrastructure and economic perspective. The economy in the state of Texas has been among the strongest in the nation in recent years. In addition to oil, gas and agriculture, the Texas economy is supported by telecommunications, computer and technology research, and the health care industry. Manufacturing and agriculture primarily drive the Indiana economy. Steel, transportation equipment, and food products are the leading manufacturers in Indiana. Indianas production of corn and wheat support its livestock and meatpacking industries as well as its dairy industry. Missouris economy relies mainly on industry. Aerospace and transportation equipment production as well as printing and publishing are important to the economic growth. Missouris mining concerns are also vital to the economy. Missouri is a leading producer of coal, zinc and lead. The economy along the I 85 corridor in South Carolina is home to numerous multinational manufacturers, resulting in one of the highest per capita foreign investment areas in the nation. Auto manufacturing has become increasingly important in recent years in this area. 26 The economy in Iowa is heavily influenced by agriculture. Iowa is one of the leaders in the production of corn and soybeans. In recent years, manufacturing has become increasingly important. Top products include farm machinery, tires and chemicals. The economy of Kentucky is primarily industrial, including manufacturing of electrical equipment, automobiles and food products. Tourism has become increasingly important in recent years. Kentucky is also a leading producer of coal. Timber products and agriculture continue to be important to the Mississippi economy, although tourism and entertainment have become important in recent years. Mississippis primary agricultural products include poultry, catfish and dairy. Mississippis coastal regions were significantly impacted by Hurricane Katrina, both from an infrastructure and economic perspective. The North Carolina economy is diversified with manufacturing, agriculture, financial services and textiles as its primary industries. North Carolina has experienced population growth well in excess of the national average in recent years. The economy is further supported by three state universities, which provide stable employment and serve as research centers in the area. The Illinois economy is diversified with manufacturing, mining, textiles and agriculture. Illinois manufactured products include food products, fabricated and primary metal products, chemicals and published materials. Illinois ranks high among the states in the production of coal as well as corn, soybeans, hay and wheat. Virginias economy is primarily industrial, including manufacturing of transportation and electrical equipment, food processing, textiles, and lumber and wood production. Agriculture remains an important industry within the state, especially production of tobacco, tomatoes, and apples. Virginia is also one of the top ten coal producers in the United States. The economies in the markets served by Regions continue to be among the best in the nation. General economic conditions deteriorated throughout the nation in 2001 and did not show significant recovery in 2002. In 2003, various sectors of the economy reported growth, while others continued the slow growth trends of 2002. Generally, economic conditions continued to improve during 2004. Overall economic conditions were generally steady during 2005, despite pressures from rising oil prices and the impact of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the Gulf Coast. These factors were offset by the continued relatively low interest rate environment, resulting in strong consumer spending, construction, and productivity growth. Commercial. Regions commercial loan portfolio is highly diversified within the markets it serves. Geographically, the largest concentration is the 18% of the commercial loan portfolio in Alabama followed by Georgia with 16%, Tennessee with 13%, Florida with 12%, and Arkansas with 9%. Commercial loans in Louisiana account for 7% of the portfolio, followed by Texas and Indiana with 5% each, Missouri with 4%, Illinois and Mississippi with 3% each, South Carolina with 2%, and Iowa, Kentucky and North Carolina with 1% each. A small portion of these loans is secured by properties outside Regions banking market areas. Included in the commercial loan classification are approximately $1.8 billion of syndicated loans. Syndicated loans are typically made to national companies and are originated through an agent bank. Regions syndicated loans are primarily to national companies with operations in Regions banking footprint. From 2001 to 2005, net commercial loan losses as a percent of average commercial loans outstanding ranged from a low of 0.52% in 2005 to a high of 0.88% in 2001. Commercial loan losses in 2005 totaled $77.2 million, or 0.52% of average commercial loans compared to 0.61% in 2004. The lower percentage of commercial loan losses in 2005 compared to 2004 resulted primarily from continued positive economic conditions. Future losses are a function of many variables, of which general economic conditions are the most important. Assuming moderate to slow economic growth during 2006 in Regions market areas and immaterial impact on Regions commercial loan portfolio from Hurricane Katrina, commercial loan losses in 2006 are expected to approximate 2005 levels. However, commercial loan losses may be higher than expected in 2006 as a result of slower than expected economic growth, unexpected losses from the hurricane season, and our inability to properly assess the credit of borrowers and underlying collateral value due to a number of factors, including environmental and other hazard factors. 27 Real Estate. Regions real estate loan portfolio consists of construction and land development loans, loans to businesses for long term financing of land and buildings, loans on one to four family residential properties, loans to mortgage banking companies (which are secured primarily by loans on one to four family residential properties and are known as warehoused mortgage loans) and various other loans secured by real estate. Real estate construction loans increased $1.9 billion in 2005 to $7.4 billion, or 12.6% of Regions total loan portfolio. Over the last five years, real estate construction loans averaged 11.2% of Regions total loan portfolio. During 2002 and 2003, construction loan demand declined as the economy exhibited signs of weakness. In 2004, as the economic conditions improved, loan demand increased as new construction projects increased. During 2005, construction loan demand increased due to generally strong economic conditions. Most of the construction loans relate to shopping centers, apartment complexes, commercial buildings and residential property development. These loans are normally secured by land and buildings and are generally backed by commitments for long term financing from other financial institutions. Real estate construction loans are closely monitored by management, since these loans are generally considered riskier than other types of loans and are particularly vulnerable in economic downturns and in periods of high interest rates. Regions generally requires higher levels of borrower equity investment in addition to other underwriting requirements for this type of lending as compared to other real estate lending. Regions has not been an active lender to real estate developers outside its market areas. The loans to businesses for long term financing of land and buildings are primarily to commercial customers within Regions markets. Total loans secured by non farm, non residential properties totaled $12.8 billion at December 31, 2005. Although some risk is inherent in this type of lending, Regions attempts to minimize this risk by generally making a significant amount of loans of this type only on owner occupied properties, and by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount, adequate cash flow to service the debt, and in most cases, the personal guarantees of principals of the borrowers. Regions also attempts to mitigate the risks of real estate lending by adhering to standard loan underwriting policies and by diversifying the portfolio both geographically within its market area and within industry groups. Loans on one to four family residential properties, which total approximately 52% of Regions real estate mortgage portfolio, are principally on single family residences. These loans are geographically dispersed throughout Regions market areas, and some are guaranteed by government agencies or private mortgage insurers. Historically, this category of loans has not produced sizable loan losses; however, it is subject to some of the same risks as other real estate lending. Warehoused mortgage loans, since they are secured primarily by loans on one to four family residential properties, are similar to these loans in terms of risk. From 2001 to 2005, net losses on real estate loans as a percent of average real estate loans outstanding ranged from a high of 0.10% in 2004 and 2005, to a low of 0.04% in 2001. In 2005, real estate loan losses were relatively flat as compared to 2004. These losses depend, to a large degree, on the level of interest rates, economic conditions and collateral values, and thus, are very difficult to predict. Management expects 2006 net real estate loan losses to increase slightly above 2005 levels. Net losses on real estate loans in 2006 may be higher as a result of borrower defaults, risks associated with construction loans such as cost overruns, project completion risk, general contractor credit risk, environmental and other hazard risks and market risks associated with the sale of completed residential units. Consumer. Regions consumer loan portfolio consists of $3.5 billion in consumer loans and $5.8 billion in personal lines of credit (including home equity loans). Consumer loans are primarily borrowings of individuals for home improvements, automobiles and other personal and household purposes. Regions consumer loan portfolio included $335 million of indirect consumer auto loans at December 31, 2005, $656 million at December 31, 2004 and $10 million at December 31, 2003. Indirect consumer loans decreased significantly in 2005 due to run off of the existing portfolio and no new origination of this category of loans. Personal lines of credit increased $557.7 million in 2005 due to marketing and sales initiatives promoting home equity loans. During the past five years, the ratio of net consumer loan losses to average consumer loans ranged from a low of 0.27% in 2005 to a high of 0.62% in 2001. Consumer loan losses decreased in 2005 due to a continued relatively strong overall economic environment. Consumer loan losses are difficult to predict but historically have tended to increase during periods of economic weakness. Management expects net consumer loan losses in 2006 to increase slightly above 2005 levels. 28 Non Performing Assets At December 31, 2005, non accrual loans totaled $341.2 million, or 0.59% of average loans, compared to $388.4 million, or 0.68% of average loans, at December 31, 2004. The decrease in non accrual loans at December 31, 2005, was primarily due to the disposition of a single large commercial credit. Commercial loans amounted to $93.7 million of the 2005 total, with real estate loans accounting for $228.3 million and consumer loans $19.2 million. Regions non performing loan portfolio is composed primarily of a number of small to medium sized loans that are diversified geographically throughout its franchise. The 25 largest non accrual loans range from $1.0 million to $7.4 million. These loans are widely dispersed among a number of industries and are generally highly collateralized. Of the $341.2 million in non accrual loans at December 31, 2005, approximately $153.5 million (45% of total non accrual loans) are secured by single family residences, which historically have had very low loss ratios. Other real estate totaled $65.5 million at December 31, 2005, $63.6 million at December 31, 2004, and $52.2 million at December 31, 2003. The increase in other real estate in 2004 compared to the prior year resulted primarily from parcels added in connection with the Union Planters transaction. Regions other real estate is composed primarily of a number of small to medium size properties that are diversified geographically throughout its franchise. The 25 largest parcels of other real estate range in recorded value from $275,000 to $5.7 million, with only four parcels over $1 million. Other real estate is recorded at the lower of (1) the recorded investment in the loan or (2) fair value less the estimated cost to sell. Although Regions does not anticipate material loss upon disposition of other real estate, sustained periods of adverse economic conditions, substantial declines in real estate values in Regions markets, actions by bank regulatory agencies or other factors, could result in additional loss from other real estate. The amount of interest income recognized in 2005 on the $341.2 million of non accruing loans outstanding at year end was approximately $11.7 million. If these loans had been current in accordance with their original terms, approximately $36.7 million would have been recognized on these loans in 2005. Loans contractually past due 90 days or more were 0.15% of total loans at December 31, 2005, compared to 0.13% of total loans at December 31, 2004. Since December 31, 2004, loan delinquencies have increased, primarily related to increases in delinquencies in the consumer loan portfolio. Loans past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2005 consisted of $44.7 million in commercial and real estate loans and $42.8 million in consumer loans. Loans with temporary payment deferrals related to Hurricane Katrina are not categorized as past due 90 days or more at December 31, 2005; however, future periods may be impacted as payment deferrals expired in December 2005. Funding Commitments In the normal course of business, Regions makes commitments under various terms to lend funds to its customers. These commitments include (among others) revolving credit agreements, term loan agreements and short term borrowing arrangements, which are usually for working capital needs. Many of these commitments are expected to expire without being funded; therefore, total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements. Letters of credit are also issued, which under certain conditions could result in loans. See Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The following table shows the amount and duration of Regions funding commitments.

This category of earning assets decreased from $115.0 million at December 31, 2004, to $92.1 million at December 31, 2005, as maturities were not reinvested in this earning asset category. Securities The following table shows the carrying values of securities by category: 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Securities held to maturity: U.S. Treasury and Federal agency securities $ 31,464 $ 31,152 $ 30,189 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 0 0 754 Total $ 31,464 $ 31,152 $ 30,943 Securities available for sale: U.S. Treasury and Federal agency securities $ 3,384,709 $ 4,375,697 $ 2,568,163 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 447,195 569,060 451,594 Mortgage backed securities 7,427,886 6,980,513 5,703,057 Other securities 108,163 179,374 101,825 Equity securities 579,857 480,793 232,222 Total $ 11,947,810 $ 12,585,437 $ 9,056,861 In 2005, total securities decreased $637 million, or 5%, due primarily to the government and agency securities sold during 2005 for balance sheet management purposes. Partially offsetting the decrease, mortgage backed securities increased $447.4 million, as purchases of such securities were used to manage interest rate sensitivity. In 2004, total securities increased $3.5 billion, or 39%, due primarily to securities added through the Union Planters transaction. U.S. Treasury and Federal agency securities increased $1.8 billion due to the Union Planters acquisition, partially offset by sales of agency securities. Agency securities were sold in 2004 for balance sheet management purposes. Mortgage backed securities increased $1.3 billion due to balances added in connection with the merger with Union Planters, partially offset by maturities as well as sales of mortgage backed securities to manage interest rate sensitivity. Regions investment portfolio policy stresses quality and liquidity. At December 31, 2005, the average contractual maturity of U.S. Treasury and Federal agency securities and obligations of states and political subdivisions was 5.0 years and 6.7 years, respectively. The average contractual maturity of mortgage backed securities was 16.0 years and the average expected maturity was 3.3 years. Other securities had an average contractual maturity of 12.9 years. Overall, the average maturity of the portfolio was 12.3 years using contractual maturities and 3.7 years using expected maturities. Expected maturities differ from contractual maturities because borrowers have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties. The estimated fair market value of Regions securities held to maturity portfolio at December 31, 2005, was $4.4 million below the amount carried on Regions books. Regions securities held to maturity at December 31, 2005 included gross unrealized losses of $4.4 million and no gross unrealized gains. Regions securities available for sale portfolio at December 31, 2005, included net unrealized losses of $139.6 million. Regions securities available for sale portfolio included gross unrealized gains of $42.9 million and gross unrealized losses of $182.5 million at December 31, 2005. Market values of these portfolios vary significantly as interest rates change. Management expects normal maturities from the securities portfolios to meet liquidity needs. Of Regions tax free securities rated by Moodys Investors Service, Inc., 99% are rated A or 31 better. The portfolio is carefully monitored to assure no unreasonable concentration of securities in the obligations of a single debtor, and current credit reviews are conducted on each security holding.

Trading Account Assets Trading account assets increased $63.4 million to $992.1 million at December 31, 2005. Trading account assets are held for the purpose of selling at a profit and are carried at market value. The following table shows the carrying value of trading account assets by type of security. December 31, 2005 2004 (in thousands) Trading account assets: U.S. Treasury and Federal agency securities $ 598,222 $ 708,938 Obligations of states and political subdivisions 181,467 150,049 Other securities 212,393 69,689 Total $ 992,082 $ 928,676 32 Loans Held for Sale Loans held for sale consisted of residential real estate mortgage loans in 2005; in the prior year, this category also included factored accounts receivables and asset based loans. These loans totaled $1.5 billion at December 31, 2005, a decrease of $252 million compared to December 31, 2004. This decrease was due primarily to the sale of the factored accounts receivables and asset based loans during 2005, as well as normal sales of mortgage loans during the year. Margin Receivables Margin receivables totaled $527.3 million at December 31, 2005, and $477.8 million at December 31, 2004. Margin receivables represent funds advanced to brokerage customers for the purchase of securities that are secured by certain marketable securities held in the customers brokerage account. The risk of loss from these receivables is minimized by requiring that customers maintain marketable securities in the brokerage account which have a fair market value substantially in excess of the funds advanced to the customer. Premises and Equipment Premises and equipment at December 31, 2005 increased by $33.2 million from the prior year. This increase resulted from the normal addition of premises and equipment related to new branches added during 2005, partially offset by a $21.5 million decrease in premises related to a second quarter 2005 transaction whereby Regions sold certain properties to a third party, but agreed to lease back a portion of these properties (see Note 10 Borrowed Funds and Note 12 Leases to the consolidated financial statements). In addition, Regions wrote off approximately $1.9 million of property destroyed by Hurricane Katrina during 2005. Excess Purchase Price Excess purchase price at December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004 totaled $5.0 billion. A significant portion of this amount is related to excess purchase price added in connection with the merger with Union Planters (see Note 18 Business Combinations to the consolidated financial statements). Other Identifiable Intangible Assets Other identifiable intangible assets totaled $314.4 million at December 31, 2005, compared to $356.9 million at December 31, 2004. The decrease from 2004 is attributable to amortization of identifiable intangible assets. This category of assets consists primarily of core deposit intangibles added in connection with the Union Planters transaction. Other Assets Other assets decreased $31.7 million compared to December 31, 2004. This decrease was primarily the result of decreases in investments in low income housing partnerships, trading receivables due from customers, and derivative assets. Liquidity General Liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of Regions and affects Regions ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of its customers. Assets, consisting principally of loans and securities, are funded by customer deposits, purchased funds, borrowed funds and stockholders equity. The securities portfolio is one of Regions primary sources of liquidity. Maturities of securities provide a constant flow of funds available for cash needs (see previous table on Securities Maturing). Maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds (see previous table on Loans Maturing). At December 31, 2005, commercial loans, real estate construction loans and commercial mortgage loans with an aggregate 33 balance of $15.5 billion, as well as securities of $535 million, were due to mature in one year or less. Additional funds are provided from payments on consumer loans and one to four family residential mortgage loans. Historically, Regions high levels of earnings have also contributed to cash flow. In addition, liquidity needs can be met by the purchase of funds in state and national money markets. Regions liquidity also continues to be enhanced by a relatively stable deposit base. The loan to deposit ratio was 96.73% at December 31, 2005, representing a decrease compared to 98.06% and 98.33% at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. This decrease is the result of deposit growth exceeding loan growth in 2004 and 2005. As reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows, operating activities provided significant levels of funds in 2005, 2004 and 2003, due primarily to high levels of net income. Investing activities were a net user of funds in 2005, primarily due to purchases of securities available for sale and loan growth, partially offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of securities available for sale. Securities were sold in 2005 to manage interest rate sensitivity. Investing activities, primarily in loans and securities, were a net provider of funds in 2004 and a net user of funds in 2003. Loan growth in 2003 required a significant amount of funds for investing activities. Funds needed for investing activities in 2003 were provided primarily by deposits, purchased funds and borrowings. Financing activities were a net user of funds in 2005, as cash dividends and the purchase of treasury stock increased compared to 2004. Increased deposits provided funds in 2005 and 2004. In 2004, financing activities were a net user of funds as payments on long term borrowings used funding, based on Regions decreased dependence on borrowed funds (excluding borrowings added in connection with acquisitions) as a funding source. In 2003, financing activities were a net user of funds as a result of declining deposit balances and increased payments on borrowed funds. Cash dividends and the open market purchase of Regions common stock also required funds in 2004 and 2003. Regions financing arrangement with the Federal Home Loan Bank (FHLB) of Atlanta adds additional flexibility in managing its liquidity position. The maximum amount that could be borrowed from the FHLB under the current borrowing agreement is approximately $24.3 billion (see Note 10 Borrowed Funds to the consolidated financial statements). Additional investment in FHLB stock is required with each advance. The FHLB has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of funding and can be used to fund debt maturities as well as other obligations. As of December 31, 2005, Regions borrowings from the FHLB totaled $1.9 billion. During the second quarter of 2005, Regions filed a universal shelf registration statement that allows the company to issue up to $2 billion of various debt and equity securities at market rates for future funding and liquidity needs. On August 3, 2005, Regions issued $750 million of senior debt notes ($400 million of 3 year floating rate notes and $350 million of 3 year fixed rate notes) under the above universal shelf registration statement. In addition, Regions bank subsidiary has the requisite agreements in place to issue and sell up to $5 billion of bank notes to institutional investors through placement agents. As of December 31, 2005, approximately $1 billion of bank notes were outstanding, including $400 million under a previous agreement and $600 million assumed through acquisitions. The issuance of additional bank notes could provide a significant source of liquidity and funding to meet future needs. Morgan Keegan maintains certain lines of credit with unaffiliated banks to manage liquidity in the ordinary course of business (see Note 10 Borrowed Funds to the consolidated financial statements). If Regions is unable to maintain or renew its financing arrangements, obtain funding in the capital markets on reasonable terms or experiences a decrease in earnings, it may be required to slow or reduce the growth of the assets on its balance sheet which may adversely impact its earnings. 34 Ratings The table below reflects the most recent debt ratings of Regions Financial Corporation and Regions Bank by Standard & Poors Corporation, Moodys Investors Service and Fitch IBCA: S&P Moodys Fitch Regions Financial Corporation: Senior notes A A1 A+ Subordinated notes A A2 A Trust preferred securities BBB+ A2 A Regions Bank: Short term certificates of deposit A 1 P 1 F1+ Short term debt A 1 P 1 F1+ Long term certificates of deposit A+ Aa3 AA Long term debt A+ Aa3 A+ A security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and the ratings above are subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating agency. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. The trust that issued the trust preferred securities was deconsolidated on December 31, 2003, in connection with the implementation of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46). Upon deconsolidation, the junior subordinated notes that are owned by the trust were included in consolidated long term borrowings. Payments made by the Company on the junior subordinated notes fully fund the payments made by the trust on the rated trust preferred securities. See Note 19 Variable Interest Entities for additional discussion on the deconsolidation of the trust. Deposits Deposits are Regions primary source of funds, providing funding for 80% of average earning assets in 2005, 76% in 2004 and 73% in 2003. During the last five years, average total deposits increased at a compound annual rate of 18%. Deposit growth was significantly impacted by the merger with Union Planters in 2004. The Union Planters transaction added $22.9 billion of total deposits (contributing $11.5 billion of average deposits in 2004 due to the mid year closing of the transaction and $11.4 billion for the full year impact in 2005). Regions acquired Union Planters on July 1, 2004; thus, average balances in 2004 reflected only six months of impact from the merger. Average balances in 2005, however, reflect the full year of impact on deposits added from the merger. The impact of deposits added in connection with the Union Planters merger is a primary factor in the discussion of variances between 2005 and prior years below. Total deposits added in connection with the Union Planters merger in 2004 are summarized in the following table. (in thousands) Non interest bearing $ 5,373,199 Savings 1,484,900 Interest bearing transaction accounts 3,383,281 Money market 5,863,360 Time deposits 6,798,524 Total $ 22,903,264 Average deposits increased $14.7 billion, or 33%, in 2005, $12.9 billion, or 40%, in 2004 and $755 million, or 2%, in 2003. Acquisitions contributed average deposit growth of approximately $11.4 billion in 2005, $11.5 billion in 2004 and $14.0 million in 2003. The $11.5 billion of deposits added through acquisitions in 35 2004, consisted of $2.7 billion of non interest bearing deposits and $8.8 billion of interest bearing deposits and significantly impact comparisons with prior periods discussed in the remainder of this section. Regions competes with other banking and financial services companies for a share of the deposit market. Regions ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on how effectively the Company meets customers needs. Regions employs both traditional and non traditional means to meet customers needs and enhance competitiveness. The traditional means include providing well designed products, providing a high level of customer service, providing attractive pricing and expanding the traditional branch network to provide convenient branch locations for customers throughout the South, Midwest and Texas. Regions also employs non traditional approaches to enhance its competitiveness. These include providing centralized, high quality telephone banking services and alternative product delivery channels such as internet banking. Regions success at competing for deposits is discussed below. Average non interest bearing deposits have increased at a compound growth rate of 35% since 2002. This category of deposits grew 40% in 2005, 61% in 2004, and 9% in 2003. Deposit growth in 2005 in this category was primarily attributable to an increase in free checking deposit accounts, the full year impact of deposits added in connection with the Union Planters merger (see above) and increases in deposits in areas affected by Hurricane Katrina. Non interest bearing deposits continue to be a significant funding source for Regions, accounting for approximately 20% of average total deposits in 2005, 19% in 2004 and 17% in 2003. Savings account balances have increased at a 27% compound growth rate since 2002. Average savings account balances increased 34% in 2005 and 53% in 2004, primarily resulting from the impact of accounts added in connection with the Union Planters acquisition. Balances declined slightly in 2003 as rates paid on these accounts were less attractive than other investment alternatives. Management expects savings accounts to continue to be a stable funding source, but does not expect significant growth, as these accounts may be less attractive than other investment alternatives for many investors. In 2005 and 2004, savings accounts comprised approximately 5% of average total deposits compared to 4% of average total deposits in 2003. Interest bearing transaction accounts have increased at a 44% compound growth rate since 2002. Average interest bearing transaction account balances decreased 2% in 2005, as investors chose other investment alternatives, compared to an increase of 31% in 2004 and 134% in 2003 as investors migrated toward more liquid assets given market conditions in those periods. Interest bearing transaction accounts accounted for 5% of average total deposits in 2005 and 7% in 2004 and 2003. Money market savings accounts have increased at a compound annual rate of 21% since 2002. In 2005, the average balance for money market savings accounts increased 26% compared to 2004, due to the full year impact of money market accounts added in connection with the Union Planters merger, as well as customers seeking liquid deposit accounts with a more attractive rate of return. Money market savings accounts increased 42% in 2004, primarily due to acquisitions. In 2003, as Regions less aggressively priced money market savings products, average balances declined 2%. Money market savings products are one of Regions most significant funding sources, accounting for 32% of average total deposits in 2005, 34% of average total deposits in 2004 and 33% of average total deposits in 2003. The average balance of certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more accounts increased 63% in 2005, primarily due to customer preference for higher rate deposits, competitive pricing on these deposit instruments, and full year impact of accounts added in connection with the Union Planters acquisition in 2004. This category of deposits increased 53% in 2004, due primarily to the deposits added in connection with the Union Planters merger. Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more increased 2% in 2003 due to less maturities of high cost certificates of deposits than in prior years. Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more accounted for 13% of average total deposits in 2005, 11% in 2004, and 10% in 2003. The average balance of other interest bearing deposits (certificates of deposit of less than $100,000 and time open accounts) increased 31% in 2005, due primarily to attractive rates and the full year impact of accounts added in connection with the Union Planters acquisition in 2004. In 2004, this category increased 22%, primarily due to acquisitions and internal growth in retail certificates of deposits based on more attractive market interest rates. In 2003, this category of deposits declined 8% as rates on these accounts were less 36 attractive to investors and Regions reduced utilization of certain wholesale deposits as a funding source. This category of deposits continues to be one of Regions primary funding sources; it accounted for 25% of average total deposits in 2005 and 2004, and 29% of average total deposits in 2003. Lower cost deposits, which include non interest bearing demand deposits, interest bearing transaction accounts, savings accounts and money market savings accounts, totaled 62% of average deposits in 2005, compared to 65% in 2004 and 61% in 2003. During 2005, customers migrated toward certificates of deposit due to the rising interest rate environment, resulting in a decrease in the percentage of low cost deposits to average deposits. During 2004 and 2003, the percentage of low cost deposits to average deposits increased, due to management initiatives to increase lower cost deposit products as a source of funding, while reducing the companys reliance on higher cost deposit products such as certificates of deposit and wholesale deposit products. The sensitivity of Regions deposit rates to changes in market interest rates is reflected in Regions average interest rate paid on interest bearing deposits. Market interest rates declined 25 basis points in 2003, increased 125 basis points in the latter half of 2004, and increased another 200 basis points during 2005. While Regions average interest rate paid on interest bearing deposits follows these trends, a lag period exists between the change in market rates and the repricing of the deposits. The rate paid on interest bearing deposits decreased from 1.61% in 2003 to 1.37% in 2004, but increased to 2.11% in 2005. A detail of interest bearing deposit balances at December 31, 2005 and 2004, and the interest expense on these deposits for the three years ended December 31, 2005, is presented in Note 9 Deposits to the consolidated financial statements. The following table presents the average rates paid on deposits by category for the three years ended December 31, 2005: Average Rates Paid 2005 2004 2003 Interest bearing transaction accounts 1.84 % 1.05 % 0.95 % Savings accounts 0.27 0.22 0.27 Money market savings accounts 1.31 0.70 0.70 Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more 3.18 2.14 2.54 Other interest bearing deposits 2.99 2.23 2.71 Total interest bearing deposits 2.11 % 1.37 % 1.61 % The following table presents the details of interest bearing deposits and maturities of the larger time deposits at December 31, 2005 and 2004: December 31, 2005 2004 (in thousands) Interest bearing deposits of less than $100,000 $ 38,879,777 $ 39,726,214 Time deposits of $100,000 or more, maturing in: 3 months or less 3,320,982 3,118,693 Over 3 through 6 months 1,177,480 1,235,081 Over 6 through 12 months 1,772,039 1,615,101 Over 12 months 1,529,051 1,547,797 7,799,552 7,516,672 Total $ 46,679,329 $ 47,242,886 37 The following table presents the average amounts of deposits outstanding by category for the three years ended December 31, 2005: Average Amounts Outstanding 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Non interest bearing demand deposits $ 12,156,817 $ 8,656,768 $ 5,380,521 Interest bearing transaction accounts 2,873,955 2,931,652 2,234,794 Savings accounts 2,926,512 2,176,025 1,425,306 Money market savings accounts 19,043,326 15,105,420 10,641,217 Certificates of deposit of $100,000 or more 8,049,384 4,952,292 3,232,152 Other interest bearing deposits 14,662,901 11,193,122 9,194,462 Total interest bearing deposits 47,556,078 36,358,511 26,727,931 Total deposits $ 59,712,895 $ 45,015,279 $ 32,108,452 Borrowed Funds Regions short term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased and security repurchase agreements, FHLB structured notes, due to brokerage customers, and other short term borrowings. Federal funds purchased and security repurchase agreements are used to satisfy daily funding needs and, when advantageous, for rate arbitrage. Federal funds purchased and security repurchase agreements totaled $3.9 billion at December 31, 2005 and $4.7 billion at December 31, 2004. Balances in these accounts can fluctuate significantly on a day to day basis. The average daily balance of federal funds purchased and security repurchase agreements, net of federal funds sold and security reverse repurchase agreements, decreased $353 million in 2005 due to reduced reliance on purchased funds to support earning asset growth, and increased $1.3 billion in 2004 as this funding source was more widely used to support growth in earning assets. At December 31, 2005, no FHLB structured notes were outstanding, compared to $350 million of structured notes outstanding at both December 31, 2004 and 2003, due to the maturities of the notes during 2005 (see Note 10 Borrowed Funds to the consolidated financial statements). During 2003, Regions prepaid $350 million of these advances in addition to maturities of $150 million. Regions incurred a $11.5 million charge related to the prepayment in 2003 that is recorded in other non interest expense (see Note 16 Other Income and Expense to the consolidated financial statements). Morgan Keegan maintains certain lines of credit with unaffiliated banks. As of December 31, 2005, $129.7 million was outstanding under these agreements with an average interest rate of 4.5%, compared to $56.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2004, with an average interest rate of 2.6%. Regions maintains a due to brokerage customer position through Morgan Keegan. This represents liquid funds in customers brokerage accounts. The due to brokerage customers totaled $547.7 million at December 31, 2005, with an interest rate of 1.7%, as compared to $457.7 million at December 31, 2004, with an interest rate of 0.7%. Regions holds cash as collateral for certain derivative and other transactions with customers and other third parties. Upon the expiration of these agreements, cash held as collateral will be remitted to the counter party. As of December 31, 2005, these balances totaled $22.5 million with an interest rate of 4.1%, as compared to $75.8 million at December 31, 2004 with an interest rate of 2.0%. Other short term borrowings decreased by $37.5 million from December 31, 2004, due primarily to a decrease in the short sale liability, which is frequently used by Morgan Keegan to offset other market risks undertaken in the normal course of business. 38 Regions long term borrowings consist primarily of subordinated notes, FHLB borrowings, senior notes and other long term notes payable. As of December 31, 2005, Regions had subordinated notes of $2.1 billion, compared to $2.2 billion at December 31, 2004. The merger with Union Planters added $1.0 billion in subordinated notes in 2004. Regions subordinated notes consist of five issues with interest rates ranging from 6.375% to 7.75%. A schedule of maturities is included in the table at the end of this section. During 2005 and 2004, Regions utilized FHLB structured notes with original call periods in excess of one year. These structured notes have various stated maturities but are callable, at the option of the FHLB, between one and two years. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, $1.0 billion and $1.8 billion of long term Federal Home Loan Bank advances were outstanding, respectively. In 2005, Regions prepaid $600 million of these borrowings, and as a result incurred a $10.9 million charge, which is recorded in other non interest expense (see Note 16 Other Income and Expense to the consolidated financial statements). In 2004, Regions prepaid $1.1 billion of these notes and as a result, incurred a $39.6 million charge which was recorded in other non interest expense. Federal Home Loan Bank long term advances totaled $837 million at December 31, 2005, a decrease of $109 million compared to 2004, due to maturities during 2005. Regions utilized this source of funding due to favorable interest rates and terms during 2004, but utilized more advantageous alternate sources of funding during 2005. Membership in the Federal Home Loan Bank system provides access to an additional source of lower cost funds. Regions issued $288 million of trust preferred securities in February 2001. These securities, which qualify as Tier 1 capital, have an interest rate of 8.00% and a 30 year term, but are callable after five years. In addition, Regions assumed $4 million of trust preferred securities in connection with a 2001 acquisition. Effective December 31, 2003, all trust preferred securities were deconsolidated in accordance with FIN 46 (see Note 19 Variable Interest Entities to the consolidated financial statements). As a result of the deconsolidation of trust preferred securities, effective December 31, 2003, Regions began reporting $301 million of junior subordinated notes. These junior subordinated notes are issued by Regions to a subsidiary business trust, which issued the trust preferred securities discussed previously (see Note 19 Variable Interest Entities to the consolidated financial statements). In connection with the acquisition of Union Planters, Regions assumed $224.3 million of 8.2% junior subordinated notes which were issued to subsidiary business trusts. Subsequent to December 31, 2005, the $288 million of Regions trust preferred securities were called and related junior subordinated notes were extinguished. In the first quarter of 2006, Regions recorded a pre tax charge of approximately $7.7 million in connection with the exercise of the call option and early extinguishment of debt. Senior debt and bank notes totaled $2.2 billion at December 31, 2005, compared to $1.5 billion at December 31, 2004. The increase is related to $350 million of 3 year fixed rate and $400 million of 3 year floating rate senior notes issued during 2005. Other long term borrowings consist of redeemable trust preferred securities, notes issued to former stockholders of acquired banks, notes for equipment financing, mark to market adjustments related to hedged debt items, and miscellaneous notes payable. 39 The following table shows the amount and maturity of Regions long term borrowed funds as of December 31, 2005. Payments Due by Period 2011 & Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 beyond (in thousands) Obligations: Subordinated notes $ 2,070,935 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 0 $ 2,070,935 Junior subordinated notes 524,143 287,500 0 0 0 0 236,643 Federal Home Loan Bank borrowings 1,872,300 350,622 251,041 66,514 1,062,627 129,805 11,691 Senior debt and bank notes 2,246,851 400,000 0 750,000 0 486,668 610,183 Other long term obligations 257,451 6,655 7,149 7,819 7,600 39,237 188,991 Total $ 6,971,680 $ 1,044,777 $ 258,190 $ 824,333 $ 1,070,227 $ 655,710 $ 3,118,443 Stockholders Equity Over the past three years, stockholders equity has increased at a compound annual growth rate of 36%. Stockholders equity has grown from $4.2 billion at the beginning of 2003 to $10.6 billion at year end 2005. Equity issued in connection with acquisitions, net of treasury share repurchases, added $5.2 billion, including $6.0 billion in equity issued in connection with the Union Planters merger. Internally generated retained earnings contributed $1.1 billion of this growth and $369.9 million was attributable to the exercise of stock options and to the issuance of stock for employee incentive plans. The internal capital generation rate (net income less dividends as a percentage of average stockholders equity) was 3.5% in 2005, compared to 4.3% in 2004 and 8.7% in 2003. This ratio declined in 2005 primarily due to a significant increase in cash dividends during the year. On October 20, 2005, Regions Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of an additional 25 million shares of Regions common stock from time to time through open market transactions. This authorization was in addition to the 6.4 million shares available for repurchase under a previous authorization. During 2005, Regions repurchased, under the current and previous repurchase authorizations, 16.6 million shares at a total cost of $552.5 million. At December 31, 2005, 27.6 million shares were available for repurchase under current and previous repurchase authorizations. Regions ratio of stockholders equity to total assets was 12.52% at December 31, 2005, compared to 12.78% at December 31, 2004, and 9.16% at December 31, 2003. This ratio decreased slightly during 2005 due to increased share repurchases. Regions ratio of tangible stockholders equity (stockholders equity less excess purchase price and other identifiable intangibles) to total assets was 6.64% at December 31, 2005 compared to 6.42% at December 31, 2004 and 6.92% at December 31, 2003. Regions attempts to balance the return to stockholders through the payment of dividends with the need to maintain strong capital levels for future growth opportunities. In 2005, Regions returned 63% of earnings to its stockholders in the form of dividends. Total dividends declared by Regions in 2005 were $628.6 million, or $1.36 per share, an increase of 2% from the $1.33 per share in 2004. In January of 2006, the Board of Directors declared a 2.9% increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $.34 to $.35 per share. This is the 35th consecutive year that Regions has increased quarterly cash dividends. 40 Bank Regulatory Capital Requirements Regions and Regions Bank are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by banking regulatory agencies. Currently, there are two basic measures of capital adequacy: a risk based measure and a leverage measure. The risk based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in risk profiles among banks and financial holding companies, to account for off balance sheet exposure and interest rate risk and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets. Assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories, each with specified risk weighting factors. The resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items. Banking organizations that are considered to have excessive interest rate risk exposure are required to maintain additional capital. The minimum standard for the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 8%. At least 50% of that capital level must consist of common equity, undivided profits and non cumulative perpetual preferred stock, less goodwill and certain other intangibles (Tier 1 capital). The remainder (Tier 2 capital) may consist of a limited amount of other preferred stock, mandatory convertible securities, subordinated debt and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses. The sum of Tier 1 capital and Tier 2 capital is total risk based capital. The banking regulatory agencies also have adopted regulations that supplement the risk based guidelines to include a minimum ratio of 3% of Tier 1 capital to average assets less goodwill (the leverage ratio). Depending upon the risk profile of the institution and other factors, the regulatory agencies may require a leverage ratio of 1% to 2% above the minimum 3% level. The following chart summarizes the applicable bank regulatory capital requirements. Regions capital ratios at December 31, 2005, substantially exceeded all regulatory requirements. Minimum Well Capitalized Regions at Regulatory Regulatory December 31, Requirement Requirement 2005 Tier 1 capital to risk adjusted assets 4.00 % 6.00 % 8.60 % Total risk based capital to risk adjusted assets 8.00 10.00 12.76 Tier 1 leverage ratio 3.00 5.00 7.42 At December 31, 2005, Tier 1 capital totaled $5.9 billion, total risk based capital totaled $8.8 billion and risk adjusted assets totaled $79.8 billion. Total capital at Regions Bank also has an important effect on the amount of FDIC insurance premiums paid. Institutions not considered well capitalized can be subject to higher rates for FDIC insurance. As of December 31, 2005, Regions Bank had the requisite capital levels to qualify as well capitalized (see Note 22 Regulatory Capital Requirements to the consolidated financial statements). 41 Consolidated Average Balances The following table shows the percentage distribution of Regions consolidated average balances of assets, liabilities and stockholders equity as of the dates shown: As of December 31, 2005 2004 2003 2002 2001 ASSETS Earning assets: Taxable securities 13.7 % 15.8 % 18.0 % 17.2 % 16.5 % Non taxable securities 0.6 0.7 1.0 1.3 1.8 Federal funds sold 0.7 0.9 1.3 1.2 1.2 Loans (net of unearned income): Commercial 17.6 19.1 21.9 22.4 21.5 Real estate 39.9 35.9 31.7 31.6 34.9 Installment 10.7 11.8 11.2 12.9 12.9 Total loans 68.2 66.8 64.8 66.9 69.3 Allowance for loan losses (0.9 ) (0.9 ) (0.9 ) (0.9 ) (0.9 ) Net loans 67.3 65.9 63.9 66.0 68.4 Other earning assets 4.2 4.9 6.1 4.7 3.8 Total earnings assets 86.5 88.2 90.3 90.4 91.7 Cash and due from banks 2.3 2.0 2.0 2.1 2.1 Other non earning assets 11.2 9.8 7.7 7.5 6.2 Total assets 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % LIABILITIES AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY Deposits: Non interest bearing 14.3 % 12.9 % 11.1 % 10.7 % 10.4 % Interest bearing 55.9 54.4 55.1 57.3 59.1 Total deposits 70.2 67.3 66.2 68.0 69.5 Borrowed funds: Short term 6.5 9.3 11.0 9.6 9.3 Long term 8.4 9.8 11.3 11.2 10.7 Total borrowed funds 14.9 19.1 22.3 20.8 20.0 Other liabilities 2.4 2.3 2.6 2.4 2.1 Total liabilities 87.5 88.7 91.1 91.2 91.6 Stockholders equity 12.5 11.3 8.9 8.8 8.4 Total liabilities and stockholders equity 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Please refer to Item 6 of this annual report on Form 10 K for a complete presentation of average balances, related interest, yields and rates paid. 42 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements and Contractual Obligations Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In the normal course of business, Regions enters into certain relationships characterized as off balance sheet arrangements. At December 31, 2005, these relationships included obligations under standby letters of credit and variable interests in unconsolidated variable interest entities. At December 31, 2005, the fair value of Regions obligation under loan standby letters of credit was $46.4 million with a maximum potential obligation of $3.1 billion (see Note 13 Commitments and Contingencies to the consolidated financial statements). At December 31, 2005, Regions investment in unconsolidated variable interest entities was $232.0 million with a maximum exposure to loss of $249.8 million (see Note 19 Variable Interest Entities to the consolidated financial statements). Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes Regions contractual cash obligations at December 31, 2005: Payments Due By Period Less than More than More than Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years (in thousands) Long term borrowings $ 6,971,680 $ 1,044,777 $ 1,082,523 $ 1,725,937 $ 3,118,443 Lease payments 529,382 88,834 144,433 100,637 195,478 Purchase obligations 544,612 196,750 252,385 94,558 919 Other 346,057 0 0 0 346,057 Total $ 8,391,731 $ 1,330,361 $ 1,479,341 $ 1,921,132 $ 3,660,897 A discussion regarding liquidity related to long term borrowings is included in the Liquidity section presented earlier. Regions intends to fund the other contractual obligations presented in the table above primarily through cash generated from normal operations. 43 Operating Results General Net income available to common shareholders increased 22% in 2005, 25% in 2004 and 5% in 2003. The accompanying table presents the dollar amount and percentage change in the important components of income that occurred in 2004 and 2005. Summary Of Changes In Operating Results Increase (Decrease) 2005 Compared 2004 Compared to 2004 to 2003 Amount % Amount % (dollar amounts in thousands) Net interest income $ 707,585 33 % $ 638,436 43 % Provision for loan losses 36,500 28 7,000 6 Net interest income after provision for loan losses 671,085 34 631,436 47 Non interest income: Brokerage and investment income 13,362 2 (17,429 ) (3 ) Trust department income 25,197 25 32,648 47 Service charges on deposit accounts 100,246 24 129,529 45 Mortgage servicing and origination fees 16,459 13 31,462 32 Securities transactions, net (81,978 ) NM 37,428 NM Other 77,715 19 97,457 31 Total non interest income 151,001 9 311,095 23 Non interest expense: Salaries and employee benefits 313,942 22 329,294 30 Net occupancy expense 64,013 40 54,213 51 Furniture and equipment expense 30,799 30 20,630 25 Other 166,819 21 274,384 54 Total non interest expense 575,573 23 678,521 38 Income before income taxes 246,513 21 264,010 29 Applicable income taxes 69,734 20 92,086 35 Net income $ 176,779 21 % $ 171,924 26 % Net income available to common shareholders $ 182,799 22 % $ 165,904 25 % Net Interest Income Net interest income (interest income less interest expense) is Regions principal source of income. Net interest income increased 33% in 2005 and 43% in 2004. On a taxable equivalent basis, net interest income increased 33% in 2005 and 42% in 2004. The following table Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income provides additional information to analyze the changes in net interest income. Regions measures its ability to produce net interest income with a ratio called the interest margin. The interest margin is net interest income (on a taxable equivalent basis) as a percentage of average earning assets. The interest margin increased from 3.49% in 2003 to 3.66% in 2004 to 3.91% in 2005. Changes in the interest margin occur primarily due to two factors: (1) the interest rate spread (the difference between the taxable equivalent yield on earning assets and the rate on interest bearing liabilities) and (2) the percentage of earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities. 44 The first factor affecting Regions interest margin is the interest rate spread. Regions average interest rate spread was 3.44% in 2005, 3.35% in 2004 and 3.19% in 2003. Market interest rates, both the level of rates and the slope of the yield curve (the spread between short term rates and longer term rates), affect the interest rate spread by influencing the pricing on most categories of Regions interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities. After reducing the Federal Funds rate significantly in 2001, the Federal Reserve Board reduced the Federal Funds rate 50 basis points in 2002 and 25 basis points in 2003. As the economy experienced growth, the Fed increased the Federal Funds rate five times totaling 125 basis points in the second half of 2004. In 2005, the Fed increased the Federal Funds rate eight times totaling 200 basis points in response to economic growth and inflation concerns. These increases resulted in a Federal Funds rate of 4.25% at December 31, 2005. Regions interest earning asset yields and interest bearing liability rates were both higher in 2005 as compared to 2004, reflecting increased average market interest rates in 2005. In 2005, Regions interest earning asset yields increased 84 basis points while interest bearing liability rates increased 75 basis points, resulting in an increased interest rate spread compared to 2004. The mix of earning assets can also affect the interest rate spread. During 2005, loans, which are typically Regions most significant and highest yielding earning asset, increased as a percentage of earning assets. This increase contributed to higher earning asset yields. Average loans as a percentage of earning assets was 78.0% in 2005 and 74.9% in 2004. During 2005 and 2004, Regions used interest rate derivatives as cash flow and fair value hedges of certain asset and liability positions. These contracts had the effect of increasing net interest income by $52.1 million in 2005 and $106.8 million in 2004. The second factor affecting the interest margin is the percentage of earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities. Funding for Regions earning assets comes from interest bearing liabilities, non interest bearing liabilities and stockholders equity. The net spread on earning assets funded by non interest bearing liabilities and stockholders equity is higher than the net spread on earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities. The percentage of earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities was 81% in 2005, 82% in 2004 and 85% in 2003. This decline positively impacted the net interest margin as compared to prior years. In the future, management expects that an increasing percentage of funding will be provided from interest bearing liabilities. Higher spreads, combined with significant growth in average interest earning assets from full year impact of the Union Planters merger in 2004, resulted in higher net interest income in 2005. The increase in net interest income for 2004 was due to higher spreads, combined with significant growth in interest earning assets due to the Union Planters merger. In 2006, Regions anticipates moderate compression of the net interest margin as short term rate increases begin to slow and the benefit from the re pricing lag for deposits diminishes. In addition, if interest rates continue to rise in 2006, the demand for loans and other interest earning assets will generally be reduced which could adversely impact Regions earnings by putting further pressure on the compression of the interest margin. 45 Analysis of Changes in Net Interest Income Year Ended December 31, 2005 over 2004 2004 over 2003 Volume Yield/Rate Total Volume Yield/Rate Total (in thousands) Increase (decrease) in: Interest income on: Loans $ 769,386 $ 458,697 $ 1,228,083 $ 688,433 $ (72,048 ) $ 616,385 Federal funds sold (207 ) 11,807 11,600 18 1,855 1,873 Taxable securities 47,888 16,769 64,657 74,590 10,654 85,244 Non taxable securities 0 3,481 3,481 211 753 964 Other earning assets 18,375 28,494 46,869 16,612 15,477 32,089 Total 835,442 519,248 1,354,690 779,864 (43,309 ) 736,555 Interest expense on: Savings deposits 1,868 1,406 3,274 1,733 (847 ) 886 Other interest bearing deposits 179,913 324,913 504,826 134,230 (68,842 ) 65,388 Borrowed funds (1,959 ) 140,964 139,005 54,039 (22,194 ) 31,845 Total 179,822 467,283 647,105 190,002 (91,883 ) 98,119 Increase in net interest income $ 655,620 $ 51,965 $ 707,585 $ 589,862 $ 48,574 $ 638,436 Note: The change in interest due to both rate and volume has been allocated to change due to volume and change due to rate in proportion to the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each. Market Risk Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, commodity prices, equity prices, or the credit quality of debt securities. Interest Rate Sensitivity Regions primary market risk is interest rate risk, including uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as uncertainty with respect to relative interest rate levels which impact both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves affecting the financial products and services that the Company offers. To quantify this risk, Regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios as compared to a base case scenario. Net interest income sensitivity (as measured over 12 months) is a useful short term indicator of Regions interest rate risk. Sensitivity Measurement. Financial simulation models are Regions primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure. Using a wide range of hypothetical deterministic and stochastic simulations, these tools provide management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates. These models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of Regions balance sheet. Assumptions are made about the direction and volatility of interest rates, the slope of the yield curve, and the changing composition of the balance sheet that result from both strategic plans and from customer behavior. Among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition, the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business. Interest rate related risks are expressly considered, such as pricing spreads, the lag time in pricing administered rate accounts, prepayments and other option risks. Regions considers these factors, as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior. 46 Financial derivative instruments are used in hedging the values of selected assets and liabilities against changes in interest rates. The effect of these hedges is included in the simulations of net interest income. The primary objectives of Asset/Liability Management at Regions are balance sheet coordination and the management of interest rate risk in achieving reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles. A standard set of alternate interest rate scenarios is compared to the results of the base case scenario to determine the extent of potential fluctuations and to establish exposure limits. The standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus and minus 100 and 200 basis points. In addition, Regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements that may more realistically mimic potential interest rate movements. The gradual scenarios include curve steepening, flattening, and parallel movements of various magnitudes phased in over a 6 month period. Exposure to Interest Rate Movements. Based on the foregoing discussion, management has estimated the potential effect of shifts in interest rates on net interest income. As of December 31, 2005, Regions maintained a slight asset sensitive position to a gradual rate shift of plus or minus 100 or 200 basis points. The following table demonstrates the expected effect that a gradual (over six months beginning at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively) parallel interest rate shift would have on Regions net interest income. 2005 2004 $ Change in % Change in $ Change in % Change in Net Interest Net Interest Net Interest Net Interest Gradual Change in Interest Rates Income Income Income Income (dollar amounts in thousands) (in basis points) +200 $ 140,000 4.9 % $ 60,000 2.3 % +100 79,000 2.8 48,000 1.8 100 (67,000 ) (2.3 ) (43,000 ) (1.6 ) 200 (169,000 ) (5.9 ) (98,000 ) (3.6 ) As of December 31, 2005, Regions maintained a slight asset sensitive position to an instantaneous rate shift of plus or minus 100 or 200 basis points. The following table demonstrates the expected effect that an instantaneous parallel interest rate shift would have on Regions net interest income. 2005 2004 $ Change in % Change in $ Change in % Change in Net Interest Net Interest Net Interest Net Interest Instantaneous Change in Interest Rates Income Income Income Income (dollar amounts in thousands) (in basis points) +200 $ 147,000 5.2 % $ 83,000 3.1 % +100 85,000 3.0 59,000 2.2 100 (81,000 ) (2.9 ) (51,000 ) (1.9 ) 200 (224,000 ) (7.9 ) (163,000 ) (6.1 ) Derivatives Regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity. The Asset and Liability Committee, in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity, approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies. The most common derivatives the Company employs are interest rate swaps, interest rate options, forward sale commitments, interest rate and foreign exchange forward contracts and credit default swaps. Interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable streams of interest payments. The notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of the interest payments. Interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a pre determined price and time. Forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell money market instruments at a future date for an already agreed upon price. Foreign exchange forwards are 47 contractual agreements to receive or deliver a foreign currency at an agreed upon future date and price. Credit default swaps are contractual agreements between counterparties whereby one party pays the other at a fixed periodic rate for the specified life of the agreement. The other party makes no payments unless a specified credit event occurs. Credit events are typically defined to include a material default, bankruptcy or debt restructuring for a specified reference asset. If such a credit event occurs, the party makes a payment to the first party, and the swap then terminates. Regions has made use of interest rate swaps and interest rate options to convert a portion of its fixed rate funding position to a variable rate position. Regions also uses derivatives to manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business. Futures contracts and forward sales commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing. In the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans, changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held for sale portfolio. Futures and forward sale commitment positions are used to protect the Company from the risk of such adverse changes. Futures contracts are also used to hedge the risks associated with customer derivatives. The change in value of the hedging contracts is expected to be highly effective in offsetting the change in value of specific assets and liabilities over the life of the hedge relationship. Regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers. Interest rate swaps, interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers. Positions with similar characteristics are used to offset the market risk and minimize income statement volatility associated with this portfolio. Those instruments used to service customers are entered into the trading account with changes in value recorded in the income statement. Refer to Note 14 Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities of the consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of Regions year end derivatives positions in the trading portfolio. The objective of Regions hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes, from an economic and accounting perspective, on net interest income and the net present value of our balance sheet. The overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions, the quality of Regions execution, the accuracy of its asset valuation assumptions, counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates. As a result, Regions hedging strategies may be ineffective in mitigating the impact of interest rate changes on its earnings. Brokerage and Market Making Activity Morgan Keegans business activities expose it to market risk, including its securities inventory positions and securities held for investment. Morgan Keegan trades for its own account in corporate and tax exempt securities and U.S. government, agency and guaranteed securities. Most of these transactions are entered into to facilitate the execution of customers orders to buy or sell these securities. In addition, it trades certain equity securities in order to make a market in these securities. Morgan Keegans trading activities require the commitment of capital. All principal transactions place the subsidiarys capital at risk. Profits and losses are dependent upon the skills of employees and market fluctuations. In some cases, in order to economically hedge the risks of carrying inventory, Morgan Keegan enters into a low level of activity involving U.S. Treasury note futures. Morgan Keegan, as part of its normal brokerage activities, assumes short positions on securities. The establishment of short positions exposes Morgan Keegan to off balance sheet risk in the event that prices increase, as it may be obligated to cover such positions at a loss. Morgan Keegan manages its exposure to these instruments by entering into offsetting or other positions in a variety of financial instruments. Morgan Keegan will occasionally economically hedge a portion of its long proprietary inventory position through the use of short positions in financial future contracts, which are included in securities sold, not yet purchased at market value. At December 31, 2005, Morgan Keegan had no outstanding futures contracts. In the normal course of business, Morgan Keegan enters into underwriting and forward and future commitments. At December 31, 2005, the contract amounts of futures contracts were $35 million to purchase 48 and $129 million to sell U.S. Government and municipal securities. Morgan Keegan typically settles its position by entering into equal but opposite contracts and, as such, the contract amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements. Settlement of the transactions relating to such commitments are not expected to have a material effect on Regions consolidated financial position. Transactions involving future settlement give rise to market risk, which represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change in the market value of a particular financial instrument. Regions exposure to market risk is determined by a number of factors, including the size, composition and diversification of positions held, the absolute and relative levels of interest rates, and market volatility. Additionally, in the normal course of business, Morgan Keegan enters into transactions for delayed delivery, to be announced securities which are recorded on the consolidated statement of financial condition at fair value. Risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from unfavorable changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities underlying the instruments. The credit risk associated with these contracts is typically limited to the cost of replacing all contracts on which the Company has recorded an unrealized gain. For exchange traded contracts, the clearing organization acts as the counterparty to specific transactions and, therefore, bears the risk of delivery to and from counterparties. Interest rate risk at Morgan Keegan arises from the exposure of holding interest sensitive financial instruments such as government, corporate and municipal bonds and certain preferred equities. Morgan Keegan manages its exposure to interest rate risk by setting and monitoring limits and, where feasible, entering into offsetting positions in securities with similar interest rate risk characteristics. Securities inventories are marked to market, and accordingly there are no unrecorded gains or losses in value. While a significant portion of the securities inventories have contractual maturities in excess of five years, these inventories, on average, turn over in excess of twelve times per year. Accordingly, the exposure to interest rate risk inherent in Morgan Keegans securities inventories is less than that of similar financial instruments held by firms in other industries. Morgan Keegans equity securities inventories are exposed to risk of loss in the event of unfavorable price movements. The equity securities inventories are marked to market and there are no unrecorded gains or losses. Morgan Keegan is also subject to credit risk arising from non performance by trading counterparties, customers, and issuers of debt securities owned. This risk is managed by imposing and monitoring position limits, monitoring trading counterparties, reviewing security concentrations, holding and marking to market collateral and conducting business through clearing organizations that guarantee performance. Morgan Keegan regularly participates in the trading of some derivative securities for its customers; however, this activity does not involve Morgan Keegan acquiring a position or commitment in these products and this trading is not a significant portion of Morgan Keegans business. To manage trading risks arising from interest rate and equity price risks, Regions uses a Value at Risk (VAR) model to measure the potential fair value the Company could lose on its trading positions given a specified statistical confidence level and time to liquidate time horizon. Regions assesses market risk at a 99% confidence level over a one day holding period. Regions primary VAR model is based upon a variance covariance approach with delta gamma approximations for non linear securities. The end of period VAR was approximately $642,000 as of December 31, 2005, and approximately $407,000 as of December 31, 2004. Maximum daily VAR utilization during 2005 was $1.2 million and average daily VAR during the same period was $466,000. 49 Provision For Loan Losses The provision for loan losses is used to establish the allowance for loan losses. Actual loan losses, net of recoveries, are charged directly to the allowance. The expense recorded each year is a reflection of managements judgment as to the adequacy of the allowance. For an analysis and discussion of the allowance for loan losses, refer to the section entitled Financial Condition Loans and Allowance for Loan Losses. During 2005, the provision for loan losses increased to $165 million (0.28% of average loans) due to higher loan losses, slightly higher past dues, and managements evaluation of current economic factors, including the impact of Hurricane Katrina. The resulting year end allowance for loan losses increased $28.8 million to $783.5 million. 2004 and 2003 provisions for loan losses were $128.5 million (0.29% of average loans) and $121.5 million (0.39% of average loans), respectively. Non Interest Income Non interest income (excluding security transactions) totaled $1.8 billion in 2005, compared to $1.6 billion in 2004 and $1.3 billion in 2003. The increase in non interest income is due primarily to fee income added by the Union Planters merger in mid 2004. Non interest income (excluding security transactions) as a percent of total revenue equaled 39% in 2005, compared to 42% in 2004 and 46% in 2003. Non interest income has declined as a percent of total revenue due to much faster growth in net interest income over the last three years, compared to the growth in non interest income. Acquisition activity in recent periods has added significantly more net interest income (in comparison to non interest income added) to the total revenue stream. Brokerage and Investment Banking Brokerage and investment income increased 2% and totaled $548.7 million in 2005, compared to $535.3 million in 2004 and $552.7 million in 2003. Brokerage and investment income is significantly affected by economic and market conditions. The increase in brokerage and investment income in 2005 resulted from strong private client, equity capital markets, trust, and investment advisory income streams in 2005. As of December 31, 2005, Morgan Keegan employed slightly more than 1,000 financial advisors. Customer assets under management totaled approximately $56.3 billion at year end 2005, compared to approximately $48.5 billion at year end 2004. Morgan Keegan contributed $101.7 million to net income in 2005. Revenues from the private client division totaled $248.4 million, or 31% of Morgan Keegans total revenue in 2005, and was the top revenue producing line of business. This line of business benefited from improved equity markets in 2005. Fixed income capital markets and equity capital markets revenue totaled $160.1 million and $86.5 million, in 2005, respectively. The investment advisory services division produced $125.4 million of revenue in 2005. Revenues generated by each division are included in various line items in the following table. Regions Morgan Keegan Trust division, which produced revenue of $103.2 million in 2005, is included with Morgan Keegan. Although Regions Morgan Keegan trust division is included with Morgan Keegan, all trust income is reported as a separate item in the consolidated statements of income (see next section titled Trust Income for discussion of changes in trust income). 50 The following table shows the components of the contribution by Morgan Keegan for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Revenues: Commissions $ 201,729 $ 179,100 $ 159,482 Principal transactions 142,150 185,113 251,902 Investment banking 117,152 103,895 92,559 Interest 85,234 56,110 48,543 Trust fees and services 103,218 86,972 60,279 Investment advisory 123,294 88,036 65,010 Other 37,476 27,972 16,664 Total revenues 810,253 727,198 694,439 Expense: Interest expense 55,237 28,886 26,244 Non interest expense 594,305 564,420 536,767 Total expenses 649,542 593,306 563,011 Income before taxes 160,711 133,892 131,428 Income taxes 59,018 50,257 49,371 Net income $ 101,693 $ 83,635 $ 82,057 The following table shows the breakout of revenue by division contributed by Morgan Keegan for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Morgan Keegan Breakout of Revenue by Division Year Ended December 31, Fixed Income Equity Private Capital Capital Regions Investment Interest Client Markets Markets MK Trust Advisory And Other (dollar amounts in thousands) 2005 Gross revenue $ 248,397 $ 160,062 $ 86,478 $ 103,225 $ 125,410 $ 86,681 Percent of gross revenue 30.7 % 19.8 % 10.7 % 12.7 % 15.5 % 10.6 % 2004 Gross revenue $ 228,693 $ 188,031 $ 69,971 $ 86,972 $ 92,835 $ 60,696 Percent of gross revenue 31.4 % 25.9 % 9.6 % 12.0 % 12.8 % 8.3 % 2003 Gross revenue $ 194,091 $ 254,177 $ 64,155 $ 60,279 $ 68,668 $ 53,069 Percent of gross revenue 27.9 % 36.6 % 9.2 % 8.7 % 9.9 % 7.7 % Trust Income Trust income increased 25% in 2005, 47% in 2004 and 12% in 2003. The increase in 2005 was driven by higher asset values, increased fees, and a full year of activity from trust accounts added through the Union Planters merger in the third quarter of 2004. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, better performance in the financial markets and increases in trust assets contributed to higher trust fees. 51 Service Charges on Deposit Accounts Service charge income increased 24% in 2005, 45% in 2004 and 4% in 2003. The addition of new accounts added in connection with the Union Planters transaction during the third quarter of 2004, partially offset by the expanded offering of free checking products were the primary reasons for the increases in 2005 and 2004 in comparison with prior years. Also negatively impacting service charges on deposits were deferrals or waivers of certain fees in the impacted areas of Hurricane Katrina during the third and fourth quarters of 2005. Increases in the number of deposit accounts, management initiatives and standardization in the pricing of certain deposit accounts and related services were the primary drivers of increases in 2003. Mortgage Servicing and Origination Fees The primary source of this category of income is Regions mortgage banking divisions, Regions Mortgage and EquiFirst. Regions Mortgages primary business and source of income is the origination and servicing of mortgage loans for long term investors. EquiFirst typically originates mortgage loans which are sold to third party investors with servicing released. Net gains or losses related to the sale of mortgage loans are included in other non interest income. In 2005, mortgage servicing and origination fees increased 13%, from $128.8 million in 2004 to $145.3 million in 2005. Origination and servicing fees increased in 2005 due to increased origination volume and servicing assets added from the Union Planters merger partially offset by a reduction in serviced loans. At December 31, 2005, Regions servicing portfolio totaled $37.2 billion and included approximately 398,000 loans. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the servicing portfolio totaled $39.4 billion and $16.1 billion, respectively. The decrease in the servicing portfolio in 2005 resulted primarily from the sale of the conforming wholesale mortgage unit during the second quarter of 2005. The increase in the servicing portfolio in 2004 resulted from the addition of the Union Planters mortgage division, partially offset by certain divestitures of out of footprint mortgage servicing rights and a relatively high level of prepayments. The decline in the servicing portfolio during 2003 resulted from high levels of prepayments due to the low interest rate environment driving record mortgage refinance activity, partially offset by higher levels of production in 2003. In 2004, mortgage servicing and origination fees increased 32% to $128.8 million. Origination and servicing fees increased in 2004 due to volume and servicing assets added from the Union Planters merger. In 2003, mortgage servicing and origination fees increased 8%, to $97.4 million. Origination fees increased in 2003 due to the significant mortgage activity resulting from the historically low interest rate environment. Servicing fees were lower in 2003, as compared to the prior year, due to a smaller servicing portfolio in 2003. Regions Mortgage and EquiFirst, through their retail, correspondent lending and wholesale operations, produced mortgage loans totaling $16.0 billion in 2005, $10.8 billion in 2004 and $9.4 billion in 2003. Regions Mortgage and EquiFirst produce loans from offices in Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas. 52 A summary of mortgage servicing rights is presented as follows. The balances shown represent the original amounts capitalized, less accumulated amortization and valuation adjustments, for the right to service mortgage loans that are owned by other investors. The amortization of mortgage servicing rights is included in other non interest expense. The carrying values of mortgage servicing rights are affected by various factors, including prepayments of the underlying mortgages. A significant change in prepayments of mortgages in the servicing portfolio could result in significant changes in the valuation adjustments. 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Balance at beginning of year $ 458,053 $ 166,346 $ 147,487 Added in connection with acquisition 0 352,574 0 Sale of servicing assets (4,007 ) (68,795 ) 0 Amounts capitalized 71,968 70,745 60,918 Amortization (84,506 ) (62,817 ) (42,059 ) $ 441,508 $ 458,053 $ 166,346 Valuation allowance (29,500 ) (61,500 ) (39,500 ) Balance at end of year $ 412,008 $ 396,553 $ 126,846 The mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance decreased by $32 million in 2005, due to a rise in mortgage rates, resulting in a decline in prepayment speeds. In contrast, the mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance increased by $22 million during 2004, due to a low mortgage rate environment, resulting in increased prepayment speeds and increased refinancing activity. See further discussion in Other Expenses below. Securities (Losses) Gains Regions reported net losses of $18.9 million from the sale of available for sale securities in 2005, as compared to net gains of $63.1 million in 2004 and $25.7 million in 2003. These gains and losses were primarily related to the sale of agency and mortgage related securities in conjunction with balance sheet management activities. Other Income The components of other income consisted mainly of fees and commissions, insurance premiums, customer derivative fees, and net gains related to the sale of mortgage loans. Fees and commission income increased 30% in 2005, due primarily to a full year of business activity related to the Union Planters merger in 2004, including ATM switch income, international income, and fees related to money orders, cashier checks, and other banking fees. Fee and commission income increased 44% in 2004 due to increased business activity related to the Union Planters merger including standby letters of credit, credit card fees, money orders, cashiers checks and other banking fees. Insurance premium and commission income decreased 7% in 2005, due primarily to a decrease in miscellaneous insurance commissions, but increased 13% in 2004, due primarily to increased revenues in the commercial property and casualty business. Regions customer derivative division primarily assists existing commercial customers with capital market products including interest rate swaps, caps and floors. Typically, Regions enters into offsetting derivative positions limiting its exposure related to customer derivative products. These exposures are marked to market on a daily basis. Capital market income totaled $27.7 million in 2005, $7.8 million in 2004 and $21.9 million in 2003. Customer derivative division revenue increased in 2005 as penetration of the legacy Union Planters customer base continued to produce sales of customer derivative products and as customers swapped floating rate loans for fixed rate loans in a flattening yield curve environment. 53 In 2005, net gains related to the sale of mortgage loans held for sale totaled $157.6 million ($129.7 million related to EquiFirst and $27.9 million related to Regions Mortgage). The increase of $20.7 million in gains during 2005 was primarily related to higher sales volume at EquiFirst during the year. For the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, gains totaled $136.9 million and $106.1 million, respectively. Non Interest Expense The main components of non interest expense are salaries and employee benefits, net occupancy expense, furniture and equipment expenses and other non interest expense. The following table presents a summary of non interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Year Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 (in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits $ 1,739,017 $ 1,425,075 $ 1,095,781 Net occupancy expense 224,073 160,060 105,847 Furniture and equipment expense 132,776 101,977 81,347 Other expenses 951,090 784,271 509,887 Total $ 3,046,956 $ 2,471,383 $ 1,792,862 Total non interest expense increased $575.6 million, or 23%, in 2005 and $678.5 million, or 38%, in 2004, due primarily to the expense base added in connection with the Union Planters merger, which occurred mid year 2004. In 2003, total non interest expense increased 4%, due primarily to increased levels of business activity and new branch offices. Also impacting comparisons between periods are merger related expenses, impairment charges related to mortgage servicing rights (including recapture of previously recognized impairment charges), losses related to prepayment of debt and storm related costs. The following tables show the impact on the major non interest expense components, excluding merger related expenses, impairment charges/recapture for mortgage servicing assets, losses for prepayment of debt and storm related costs. Management believes the following tables are useful in evaluating trends in non interest expense. For further discussion of non interest expense, refer to the following discussion of each component of non interest expense. 2005 Non Interest Expense Less: Merger Related, Debt Retirement, MSR Recapture, and Storm Related As Reported Charges As Adjusted (in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits $ 1,739,017 $ 74,256 $ 1,664,761 Net occupancy expense 224,073 7,550 216,523 Furniture and equipment expense 132,776 826 131,950 Other expenses 951,090 73,113 877,977 Total $ 3,046,956 $ 155,745 $ 2,891,211 In 2005, merger and storm related charges totaled $176.8 million, impairment recapture on mortgage servicing rights totaled $32.0 million and losses on early extinguishment of debt ($600 million of Federal Home Loan Bank structured notes) totaled $10.9 million. During 2005, Regions received a $10 million advance from its insurance carrier for claims expected to be filed in connection with the damage from Hurricane Katrina. This advance was used to partially offset expenses incurred in connection with Hurricane Katrina. The advance was included in the operating activities section of the consolidated statement of cash flows. Regions recorded approximately $8.0 million in net storm related expenses during 2005. 54 In connection with the integration of Regions and Union Planters, Regions has incurred merger related expenses throughout the integration process. Merger related expenses include costs incurred in connection with the merger, integration and restructuring activities, including retention and severance costs, professional fees incurred with integration activities, contract buyouts, lease termination penalties, loss on disposals of duplicate facilities and other direct and incremental costs related to the transaction. Costs incurred in connection with the merger, integration and restructuring activities were funded from cash flows from operations. 2004 Non Interest Expense Less: Merger Related, Debt Retirement and MSR Impairment, and Storm related As Reported Charges As Adjusted (in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits $ 1,425,075 $ 16,296 $ 1,408,779 Net occupancy expense 160,060 1,725 158,335 Furniture and equipment expense 101,977 169 101,808 Other expenses 784,271 98,569 685,702 Total $ 2,471,383 $ 116,759 $ 2,354,624 In 2004, merger related and storm related charges totaled $55.1 million, impairment charges on mortgage servicing rights totaled $22.0 million and losses on prepayment of debt ($1.1 billion of Federal Home Loan Bank advances) totaled $39.6 million. 2003 Non Interest Expense Less: Debt Retirement and MSR Recapture As Reported Charges As Adjusted (in thousands) Salaries and employee benefits $ 1,095,781 $ 0 $ 1,095,781 Net occupancy expense 105,847 0 105,847 Furniture and equipment expense 81,347 0 81,347 Other expenses 509,887 19,580 490,307 Total $ 1,792,862 $ 19,580 $ 1,773,282 In 2003, a net recapture of $1.0 million on mortgage servicing rights was recorded; additionally, Regions chose to prepay $650 million of Federal Home loan Bank advances, resulting in a $20.6 million charge from prepayment of this debt. Salaries and Employee Benefits Total salaries and benefits increased 22% in 2005, 30% in 2004 and 9% in 2003. The increase in salaries and benefits during 2005 and 2004 was primarily attributable to salaries and benefits of associates added in connection with the Union Planters merger, as well as incremental incentive costs related to increased revenue production. Excluding $74.3 million of merger related charges, salaries and benefits increased 18% in 2005 due to the above noted items. Salaries and benefits were higher in 2003, as compared to the prior year, due primarily to higher incentive costs associated with Morgan Keegan, Equifirst, and Regions Mortgage, as well as normal merit and promotional adjustments. At December 31, 2005, Regions had approximately 25,000 full time equivalent employees, compared to approximately 26,000 at December 31, 2004 and approximately 16,000 at December 31, 2003. The decrease in 55 full time equivalent employees from December 31, 2004 to December 31, 2005 was related to streamlined processes, converted systems, and normal attrition; the increase in employees in 2004 resulted primarily from personnel added with the 2004 Union Planters transaction. Salaries, excluding benefits, totaled $985.1 million in 2005, compared to $830.8 million in 2004 and $598.5 million in 2003. Salaries increased in 2005 primarily as a result of an increase in full year headcount in connection with the Union Planters merger. Increased salaries in 2004 resulted from higher employment levels in connection with the Union Planters merger, while higher salary levels in 2003 were primarily the result of normal merit and promotional adjustments. Regions provides employees who meet established employment requirements with a benefits package which includes 401(k), pension, and medical, life and disability insurance plans. The total cost to Regions for fringe benefits, including payroll taxes, equaled approximately 29% of salaries in 2005. Regions 401(k) plan includes a company match of eligible employee contributions. At December 31, 2005, this match totaled 100% of the eligible employee contribution (up to 6% of compensation) after one year of service and is invested in Regions common stock. Regions contribution to the 401(k) plan on behalf of employees totaled $34.2 million, $25.7 million, and $16.5 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Commissions and incentives expense increased to $468.7 million in 2005, compared to $381.0 million in 2004 and $352.1 million in 2003. The increases in commissions and incentives were primarily the result of increased participants in various incentive programs, as well as higher commissions paid at Morgan Keegan and EquiFirst, linked to increased production levels and sales goals. At Morgan Keegan, commissions and incentives are a key component of compensation, which is typical in the brokerage and investment banking industry. In general, incentives continue to be used to reward employees for selling products and services, for productivity improvements and for achievement of corporate financial goals. Regions long term incentive plan provides for the granting of stock options, restricted stock and performance shares (see Note 20 Stock Option and Long Term Incentive Plans to the consolidated financial statements). Pension expense totaled $22.0 million in 2005, $22.5 million in 2004 and $19.8 million in 2003. Pension expense in 2006 is expected to approximate $19.7 million. Payroll taxes increased 28% in 2005, 37% in 2004 and 3% in 2003. Increases in the number of associates combined with the increase in the Social Security tax base and increased salary levels were the primary reasons for increased payroll taxes. Group insurance expense increased 22% in 2005, 56% in 2004 and 12% in 2003. The increases were the result of increased levels of covered employees and higher claims costs. Net Occupancy Expense Net occupancy expense includes rents, depreciation and amortization, utilities, maintenance, insurance, taxes and other expenses of premises occupied by Regions and its affiliates. Regions affiliates operate offices primarily in Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas and Virginia. Net occupancy expense increased 40% in 2005, 51% in 2004 and 8% in 2003 due primarily to expenses added in connection with acquisitions, new and acquired branch offices, expenses incurred in connection with Hurricane Katrina (2005) and rising price levels. Furniture and Equipment Expense Furniture and equipment expense increased 30% in 2005 and 25% in 2004 due to expenses added in connection with acquisitions, expenses incurred in connection with Hurricane Katrina (specific to 2005), rising price levels and expenses related to equipment for new branch offices (including increased depreciation and service contract expenses associated with new back office and branch equipment). Furniture and equipment expense decreased 10% in 2003, due primarily to lower expenses related to computer equipment. 56 Other Expenses The significant components of other expense include legal and other professional fees, other non credit losses, amortization and impairment of mortgage servicing rights, amortization of identifiable intangibles and computer and other outside services. Increases in this category of expense generally resulted from acquisitions, expanded programs, increased business activity and rising price levels. Other expenses included costs related to the merger and other charges totaling $73.1 million in 2005, $98.6 million in 2004 and $19.6 million in 2003, as previously discussed. Please refer to Note 16 Other Income and Expense to the consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the significant components of other expense. Legal and other professional fees increased during 2005, primarily due to integration activities undertaken and a full year of expenses added in connection with the Union Planters merger in July of 2004. Legal and other professional fees increased significantly in 2004, as compared to 2003 and 2002, due to costs incurred related to the merger and integration with Union Planters. These costs include fees paid to attorneys, accountants and other professionals involved in the Union Planters transaction as well as costs incurred in the ordinary course of business. Other non credit losses primarily include charges for items unrelated to the extension of credit such as fraud losses, litigation losses, write downs of other real estate, insurance claims and other miscellaneous losses. Other non credit losses increased in 2005, primarily due to increased write downs in other real estate, as well as increases in fraud, litigation and miscellaneous losses. Other non credit losses increased in 2004 due to higher losses related to litigation, fraud and other expenses related to increased business activity added by the Union Planters merger. The 2003 decrease was primarily related to lower losses related to litigation. Amortization of mortgage servicing rights increased in 2005, primarily due to full year amortization on the servicing rights added in connection with the Union Planters merger in July 2004. Accelerated amortization expense, due to the low interest rate environment and increased prepayments of underlying mortgages, combined with the addition of servicing rights added by the Union Planters merger, resulted in additional amortization expense in 2004 and 2003. During 2005, Regions recognized a $32 million recapture on impairment of mortgage servicing rights, due to rising mortgage rates and reduced prepayment speed assumptions related to the serviced mortgages. Regions recognized $22 million of impairment in 2004 as mortgage rates declined, refinancing activity increased, and prepayment speeds increased. Regions recognized $1 million in recapture of impairment during 2003, resulting from a slight decrease in prepayment speeds from modest increases in mortgage rates. Amortization of identifiable intangible assets increased significantly in 2005 and 2004. The increase was related to amortization of intangible assets (primarily core deposit intangibles) recorded in connection with the Union Planters merger. During 2005, Regions incurred a $10.9 million charge on the early extinguishment of $600 million of FHLB structured notes (classified in long term debt). During 2004, Regions incurred a $39.6 million charge on the early extinguishment of $1.1 billion of long term Federal Home Loan Bank advances. During 2003, in connection with the prepayment of $650 million of Federal Home Loan Bank advances, Regions incurred a $20.6 million loss on early extinguishment of debt. Applicable Income Tax Regions provision for income taxes for 2005 increased $69.7 million compared to 2004 due primarily to increased earnings resulting from the 2004 merger with Union Planters and increased consolidated earnings in 2005, offset by both an increase in tax credits and increased benefits from the recapitalized mortgage related subsidiary further described below. Regions effective tax rate for 2005 was 29.6%, compared to 29.9% for 2004 and 28.5% for 2003. From time to time Regions engages in business plans that may also have an effect on its tax liabilities. While Regions has obtained the opinion of advisors that the tax aspects of these strategies should prevail, examination of Regions income tax returns or changes in tax law may impact the tax benefits of these plans. Periodically, Regions invests in pass through investment vehicles that generate tax credits, principally low income housing credits and non conventional fuel source credits, which directly reduce Regions federal 57 income tax liability. Congress has legislated these tax credit programs to encourage capital inflows to these investment vehicles. The amount of tax benefit recognized from these tax credits was $47.6 million in 2005, compared to $35.4 million in 2004. During the fourth quarter of 2000, Regions recapitalized a mortgage related subsidiary by raising Tier 2 capital, which resulted in a reduction in taxable income of that subsidiary attributable to Regions. The reduction in the taxable income of this subsidiary attributable to Regions is expected to result in a lower effective tax rate applicable to the consolidated taxable income before taxes of Regions for future periods. The impact on Regions effective tax rate applicable to consolidated income before taxes of the reduction in the subsidiarys taxable income attributable to Regions will, however, depend on a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the amount of assets in the subsidiary, the yield of the assets in the subsidiary, the cost of funding the subsidiary, possible loan losses in the subsidiary, the level of expenses of the subsidiary, the level of income attributable to obligations of states and political subdivisions, and various other factors. The amount of federal and state tax benefits recognized related to the recapitalized subsidiary was $54.7 million in 2005 ($41.9 million federal) compared to $42.9 million in 2004 ($33.6 million federal). Regions has segregated a portion of its investment securities and intellectual property into separate legal entities in order to, among other business purposes, protect such intangible assets from inappropriate claims of Regions creditors, and to maximize the return on such assets by the professional and focused management thereof. Regions has recognized state tax benefits related to these legal entities of $27.6 million in 2005 compared to $17.4 million in 2004. Regions federal and state income tax returns for the years 1998 through 2004 are open for review and examination by governmental authorities. In the normal course of these examinations, Regions is subject to challenges from governmental authorities regarding amounts of taxes due. Regions has received notices of proposed adjustments relating to taxes due for the years 1999 through 2003, which include proposed adjustments relating to an increase in taxable income of the mortgage related subsidiary discussed above. Regions believes adequate provision for income taxes has been recorded for all years open for review and intends to vigorously contest the proposed adjustments. To the extent that final resolution of the proposed adjustments results in significantly different conclusions from Regions current assessment of the proposed adjustments, Regions effective tax rate in any given financial reporting period may be materially different from its current effective tax rate. Managements determination of the realization of the deferred tax asset is based upon managements judgment of various future events and uncertainties, including the timing, nature and amount of future income earned by certain subsidiaries and the implementation of various plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset. Management believes that the subsidiaries will generate sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax benefits. However, management does not believe that it is more likely than not to realize all of its capital loss carryforwards nor all of its state net operating loss carryforwards. Accordingly, it has valuation allowances of $55.2 million and $12.6 million, respectively, against such benefits. Note 17 Income Taxes to the consolidated financial statements provides additional information about the provision for income taxes. Effects Of Inflation The majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature; therefore, a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies, which have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories. However, inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio. Inflation also affects other expenses that tend to rise during periods of general inflation. Management believes the most significant impact of inflation on financial results is Regions ability to react to changes in interest rates. As discussed previously, management is attempting to maintain an essentially balanced position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to protect net interest income from being affected by wide interest rate fluctuations. 58 Item 7A.
