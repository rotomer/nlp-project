Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Certain information contained in Managements Discussion and Analysis and in other parts of this report may be deemed forward looking statements regarding events and financial trends that may affect the Companys future operating results or financial positions. These statements may be identified by words such as "estimate", "project", "plan", "intend", "believe", "expect", "anticipate", or variations or negatives thereof or by similar or comparable words or phrases. Forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: changes in levels of unemployment and other economic conditions in the U.S. or foreign countries where the Company does business, or in particular regions or industries; reduction in the supply of qualified candidates for temporary employment or the Companys ability to attract qualified candidates; the entry of new competitors into the marketplace or expansion by existing competitors; the ability of the Company to maintain existing client relationships and attract new clients in the context of changing economic or competitive conditions; the impact of competitive pressures, including any change in the demand for the Companys services, on the Companys ability to maintain its profit margins; the possibility of the Company incurring liability for the activities of its temporary employees or for events impacting its temporary employees on clients premises; the success of the Company in attracting, training and retaining qualified management personnel and other staff employees; and whether governments will impose additional regulations or licensing requirements on personnel services businesses in particular or on employer/employee relationships in general. Because long term contracts are not a significant part of the Companys business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. Critical Accounting Policies In response to the SECs Release No. 33 8040, "Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies," we identified the Companys most critical accounting policies to be those that involve subjective decisions, assessments or estimates. These are described in Note A to the consolidated financial statements. The Company has a long history of issuing stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of its compensation programs. Generally accepted accounting principles allow alternative methods of accounting for these plans. The Company has chosen to account for its stock option plans under APB opinion 25. Accordingly, no compensation expense related to stock options is included in determining net income and net income per share in the consolidated financial statements. The alternative method of accounting for stock options is prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123. Note I to the consolidated financial statements sets forth calculations of pro forma net income and net income per share computed in accordance with this alternative method. Results of Operations for the Three Years Ended December 31, 2001 Temporary and consultant staffing revenues were $2.26 billion, $2.45 billion and $1.92 billion for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, decreasing by 8% during 2001 and increasing by 28% during 2000. Permanent placement staffing revenues were $189 million, $252 million and $159 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, decreasing by 25% during 2001 and increasing by 58% during 2000. Overall 2001 revenue results were adversely impacted by the ongoing recession in the United States, which is also expected to negatively impact 2002 revenue results. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had more than 330 offices in 41 states and the District of Columbia and 10 foreign countries. Revenues from domestic operations represented 85%, 89% and 88% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Revenues from foreign operations represented 15%, 11% and 12% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Gross margin dollars from the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist of payroll, payroll taxes and insurance costs for temporary employees. Gross margin dollars from permanent placement staffing services are equal to revenues, as there are no direct costs associated with such revenues. Gross margin dollars for the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services were $828 million, $908 million and $703 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, decreasing by 9% in 2001 and increasing by 29% in 2000. Gross margin amounts equaled 37% of revenues for temporary and consultant staffing services for the three years ended December 31, 2001, 2000, and 1999, which the Company believes reflects its ability to adjust billing rates and wage rates to underlying market conditions. Gross margin dollars for the Companys permanent placement staffing division were $189 million, $252 million and $159 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, decreasing by 25% and increasing by 58% in 2001 and 2000, respectively. 7 Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of staff compensation, advertising, depreciation and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $823 million during 2001, compared to $864 million in 2000 and $628 million in 1999. The decrease in 2001 primarily reflects lower staff compensation costs, which were partially offset by increases in depreciation and occupancy costs. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 34% for the year ended December 31, 2001, and 32% for the year ended December 31, 2000 and 30% for the year ended December 31, 1999. The percentage increase in 2001 was due to the negative leverage from fixed operating expenses including depreciation and occupancy costs. The Company allocates the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net tangible assets first to identifiable intangible assets, if any, and then to goodwill. Although management believes that goodwill has an unlimited life, the Company amortizes these costs over 40 years. Management believes that its previous acquisitions of established companies in established markets and maintaining its presence in these markets preserves the goodwill for an indeterminate period. The carrying value of intangible assets is periodically reviewed by the Company and impairments are recognized when the expected future operating cash flows derived from such intangible assets is less than their carrying value. Based upon its most recent analysis, the Company believes that there was no material impairment of intangible assets at December 31, 2001. Net intangible assets represented 16% of total assets and 20% of total stockholders equity at December 31, 2001. The Company will adopt SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, on January 1, 2002, resulting in the discontinuance of the amortization of certain intangible assets currently amortized over 40 years. Upon adoption of SFAS No. 142, the Company expects to stop recording amortization expense, net of income tax effects, of approximately $4.6 million per year. The methods used for evaluating and measuring impairment of certain intangible assets will change. While the Company has not completed the new impairment analysis, it is not expected to have a material effect on the financial statements. Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $9.3 million, $11.3 million and $6.8 million, respectively. Higher average cash balances in 2001 were more than offset by lower interest rates earned during the year. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 was $.8 million, $.9 million and $.7 million, respectively. The provision for income taxes was 38% for both the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000 and 40% for the year ended December 31, 1999. The decrease for years 2001 and 2000 reflects the impact of various state tax planning initiatives undertaken during 1999. Liquidity and Capital Resources The change in the Companys liquidity during the past three years is the net effect of funds generated by operations and the funds used for the staffing services acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases of common stock, and principal payments on outstanding notes payable. As of December 31, 2001, the Company has authorized the repurchase, from time to time, of up to 8 million additional shares of the Companys common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions. During the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company repurchased approximately 4.3 million shares of common stock on the open market bringing the total shares repurchased under this and previous authorizations to approximately 20 million shares. Repurchases of the securities have been funded with cash generated from operations. For the year ended December 31, 2001, the Company generated $276 million in cash from operations, used $85 million in investing activities and used $83 million in financing activities. The Companys working capital at December 31, 2001, included $347 million in cash and cash equivalents. In addition, at December 31, 2001, the Company had available $75 million of its $80 million bank revolving line of credit. The Companys working capital requirements consist primarily of the financing of accounts receivable. While there can be no assurances in this regard, the Company expects that internally generated cash plus the bank revolving line of credit will be sufficient to support the working capital needs of the Company, the Companys fixed payments, and other obligations on both a short and long term basis. As of December 31, 2001, the Company had no material capital commitments.  Item 7A.
