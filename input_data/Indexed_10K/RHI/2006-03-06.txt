Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Certain information contained in Managements Discussion and Analysis and in other parts of this report may be deemed forward looking statements regarding events and financial trends that may affect the Companys future operating results or financial positions. These statements may be identified by words such as estimate, forecast, project, plan, intend, believe, expect, anticipate, or variations or negatives thereof or by similar or comparable words or phrases. Forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: changes in levels of unemployment and other economic conditions in the United States or foreign countries where the Company does business, or in particular regions or industries; reduction in the supply of candidates for temporary employment or the Companys ability to attract candidates; the entry of new competitors into the marketplace or expansion by existing competitors; the ability of the Company to maintain existing client relationships and attract new clients in the context of changing economic or competitive conditions; the impact of competitive pressures, including any change in the demand for the Companys services, on the Companys ability to maintain its margins; the possibility of the Company incurring liability for its activities, including the activities of its temporary employees, or for events impacting its temporary employees on clients premises; the possibility that adverse publicity could impact the Companys ability to attract and retain clients and candidates; the success of the Company in attracting, training, and retaining qualified management personnel and other staff employees; whether governments will impose additional regulations or licensing requirements on personnel services businesses in particular or on employer/employee relationships in general; whether there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; and litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities, including litigation that may be disclosed from time to time in the Companys SEC filings. Additionally, with respect to Protiviti, other risks and uncertainties include the fact that future success will depend on its ability to retain employees and attract clients; there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; failure to produce projected revenues could adversely affect financial results; and there is the possibility of involvement in litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities. Further information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Because long term contracts are not a significant part of the Companys business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates As described below, the Companys most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments. Accounts Receivable Allowances. The Company maintains accounts receivable allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. If the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, additional allowances may be required. Estimates used in determining the accounts receivable allowances were based on current trends and historical loss statistics. Actual results may differ from these estimates, which may materially affect the Companys future financial results. Income Tax Assets and Liabilities. In establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the Company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to its operations. The Company records deferred tax assets and liabilities and evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts. The likelihood of a material change in the Companys expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final U.S. and foreign tax settlements, and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions. While management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding deferred income tax assets and liabilities are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the Company. 11 Employee Retirement Plans. The determination of the Companys obligations for its defined benefit retirement agreement for the Companys Chief Executive Officer is dependent upon various assumptions, including, among others, expected retirement age, mortality, expected post retirement Consumer Price Index increases, and discount rates. Management believes its assumptions are appropriate; however, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the Companys future financial results. Goodwill Impairment. The Company assesses the impairment of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. This assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. The estimate of cash flow is based upon, among other things, certain assumptions about expected future operating performance and an appropriate discount rate determined by management. The Companys estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance. Significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flow could materially affect the future financial results of the Company. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required. Workers Compensation. The Company self insures or retains a portion of the exposure for losses related to workers compensation. The Company has established reserves for workers compensation claims based on historical loss statistics and periodic third party actuarial valuations. While management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the Companys future financial results. Stock Option Plans. The Company has a long history of issuing stock options to employees and directors as an integral part of its compensation programs. Accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America allow alternative methods of accounting for these plans. The Company has chosen to account for its stock option plans under Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25). Under APB 25, the intrinsic value of the options is used to record compensation expense and, as a result, no compensation expense related to stock options is included in determining net income and net income per share in the Financial Statements. Restricted stock and stock unit grants are accounted for in accordance with APB 25. APB 25 mandates that restricted stock grants with performance conditions are calculated using the intrinsic value. As required by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, calculations of pro forma net income (loss) and net income (loss) per share, computed in accordance with the method prescribed by SFAS No. 123, Share Based Payment (SFAS 123), are set forth in Note A to the Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In June 2005, the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) issued Issue No. 05 6, Determining the Amortization Period for Leasehold Improvements (EITF 05 6), which requires that leasehold improvements that are placed in service significantly after and not contemplated at or near the beginning of a lease term be amortized over the shorter of the useful life of the assets or a term that includes required lease periods and renewal periods that are deemed to be reasonably assured at the date the leasehold improvements are purchased. The adoption of EITF 05 6 during the three months ended September 30, 2005 did not have an impact on the Companys Financial Statements. In March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143, (FIN 47) which requires an entity to recognize a liability for the fair value of a conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. The Company adopted the provisions of FIN 47 in the three months ended December 31, 2005. The adoption of FIN 47 did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 12 In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections A replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 (SFAS 154). SFAS 154 applies to all voluntary changes in accounting principle, and changes the requirements for accounting for and reporting of a change in accounting principle. SFAS 154 requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of a voluntary change in accounting principle unless it is impracticable. APB Opinion No. 20 previously required that most voluntary changes in accounting principle be recognized by including in net income of the period of the change the cumulative effect of changing to the new accounting principle. The provisions in SFAS 154 are effective for accounting changes and correction of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. Accordingly, the Company will adopt SFAS 154 effective January 1, 2006. The adoption of SFAS 154 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys results of operations. During December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which revises SFAS 123 and supersedes APB 25. SFAS 123R requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized as expense based on their fair values. In April 2005, the SEC amended the effective date of SFAS 123R to be the first annual period beginning after June 15, 2005. The pro forma disclosures previously permitted under SFAS 123 will no longer be an alternative to expense recognition. Under SFAS 123R, the Company will be required to select a valuation technique, or option pricing model that meets the criteria as stated in the standard. Allowable valuation models include a binomial model and the Black Scholes model. The Company is required to adopt the provisions of SFAS 123R in the first quarter of 2006. The Company is in the process of assessing the impact on the Companys results of operations from the adoption of SFAS 123R for its effect on prospective option grants. The adoption of SFAS 123R requires the Company to value stock options granted prior to its adoption of SFAS 123R under the fair value method and expense these amounts in the income statement over the stock options remaining vesting period. This will result in the Company expensing approximately $17 million, before income tax effects, in 2006 that would previously have been presented in a pro forma footnote disclosure. In addition, SFAS 123R will require the Company to reflect the tax savings resulting from tax deductions in excess of expense reflected in its financial statements as a financing cash flow, which will impact the Companys future reported cash flow from operating activities. In March 2005, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107 (SAB 107) to give guidance on the implementation of SFAS 123R. The Company will consider SAB 107 during implementation of SFAS 123R. Results of Operations for the Three Years Ended December 31, 2005 Temporary and consultant staffing services revenues were $2.6 billion, $2.2 billion and $1.7 billion for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, increasing by 21% and 25% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Permanent placement revenues were $219 million, $136 million and $95 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, increasing by 61% and 43% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Improvement in the U.S. labor markets contributed to the increase in temporary and permanent staffing services revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were $479 million, $352 million and $133 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, increasing by 36% and 164% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2005 and 2004 increases in risk consulting and internal audit services revenues is primarily due to increased brand acceptance in the marketplace and expanding demand related to increased focus on internal accounting controls and other corporate governance requirements, including the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. There can be no assurances that there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes Oxley or other regulatory compliance services, or that future results can be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. We expect total Company revenues to continue to be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in 2006. The Companys temporary and permanent staffing services business has more than 330 offices in 42 states, the District of Columbia and twelve foreign countries, while Protiviti has more than 45 offices in 22 states and ten foreign countries. Revenues from foreign operations represented 19%, 18% and 18% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. 13 Gross margin dollars from the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist of payroll, payroll taxes and insurance costs for temporary employees. Gross margin dollars from permanent placement staffing services are equal to revenues, as there are no direct costs associated with such revenues. Gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist primarily of professional staff payroll, payroll taxes, insurance costs and reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services were $963 million, $787 million and $610 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, increasing by 22% and 29% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Gross margin amounts equaled 36%, 36% and 35% of revenues for temporary and consultant staffing services for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The higher 2004 temporary and consultant gross margin percentage is primarily the result of higher bill rates and conversion revenues. Gross margin dollars for the Companys permanent placement staffing division were $219 million, $136 million and $95 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, increasing by 61% and 43% in 2005 and 2004, respectively. Gross margin dollars for the Companys risk consulting and internal audit division were $190 million, $133 million and $22 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Gross margin amounts equaled 40%, 38% and 16% of revenues for risk consulting and internal audit services for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The 2005 and 2004 improvements in risk consulting and internal audit services gross margin dollars is primarily the result of higher revenues and improved staff utilization. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $991 million in 2005, compared to $824 million in 2004 and $707 million in 2003. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 30%, 31% and 36% for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of staff compensation, advertising, depreciation and occupancy costs. The lower 2005 and 2004 selling, general and administrative expense percentages resulted primarily from leveraging fixed operating costs. For acquisitions, the Company allocates the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net tangible assets first to identifiable intangible assets, if any, and then to goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their lives, typically ranging from two to five years. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test during each of the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required. Net intangible assets, consisting primarily of goodwill, represented 13% of total assets and 17% of total stockholders equity at December 31, 2005. Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $12.1 million, $5.0 million and $3.4 million, respectively, while interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $1.1 million, $1.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively. Higher average cash balances in 2005 and 2004 and higher interest rates during those years yielded higher interest income. The provision for income taxes was 39%, 40% and 45% of income before taxes for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The decreases in 2005 and 2004 are due primarily to the diminishing impact of permanent non deductible tax items, which became increasingly less significant relative to the Companys improved financial results, and to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in certain states and international locations. Liquidity and Capital Resources The change in the Companys liquidity during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is primarily the net effect of funds generated by operations and the funds used for capital expenditures, repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends and principal payments on outstanding notes payable. 14 In connection with the preparation of its report on Form 10 Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2005, the Company concluded that it was appropriate to classify its auction rate securities as marketable securities. Previously, such investments had been classified as cash and cash equivalents. Accordingly, adjustments have been made to the Companys Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 to reflect the gross purchases and sales of these securities as investing activities rather than as a component of cash and cash equivalents. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $458 million, $437 million and $377 million at December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Operating activities and investing activities provided $328 million and $22 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2005, partially offset by $232 million of net cash used in financing activities. Operating activities provided $162 million during the year ended December 31, 2004, partially offset by $37 million and $76 million of net cash used in investing activities and financing activities, respectively. Operating activities provided $113 million during the year ended December 31, 2003, partially offset by $57 million and $8 million of net cash used in investing activities and financing activities, respectively. Operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was composed of net income of $238 million adjusted for non cash items of $122 million, and net cash used for changes in working capital of $32 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was composed of net income of $141 million adjusted for non cash items of $93 million, and net cash used for changes in working capital of $72 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was composed of net income of $6 million adjusted for non cash items of $98 million, and net cash provided by changes in working capital of $9 million. Investing activities Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $22 million. This was primarily composed of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $92 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $62 million, purchases of goodwill and other intangible assets of $4 million, and deposits to trusts for employee benefits and retirement plans of $3 million. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $37 million. This was primarily capital expenditures of $33 million. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $57 million. This was primarily capital expenditures of $37 million and purchases of goodwill and other intangible assets of $18 million. Financing activities Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $232 million. This included repurchases of $262 million in common stock and $48 million in cash dividends to stockholders, partially offset by proceeds of $77 million from exercises of stock options. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $76 million. This included common stock repurchases of $90 million and cash dividends to stockholders of $31 million, partially offset by proceeds of $44 million from exercises of stock options. Financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $8 million. This included common stock repurchases of $33 million, partially offset by proceeds of $25 million from exercises of stock options. As of December 31, 2005, the Company is authorized to repurchase, from time to time, up to 9.3 million additional shares of the Companys common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, the Company repurchased approximately 7.6 million, 2.7 million and 1.6 million shares of common stock on the open market for a total cost of $222 million, $64 million and $25 million, respectively. Additional stock repurchases were made in connection with employee stock plans, whereby Company shares were tendered by employees for the payment of applicable statutory withholding taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, such repurchases totaled approximately 1.6 million, 1.0 million and 0.5 million shares at a cost of $53 million, $25 million and $8 million, respectively. Repurchases of securities have been funded with cash generated from operations. 15 The Companys working capital at December 31, 2005 included $458 million in cash and cash equivalents. The Companys working capital requirements relate primarily to accounts receivable. While there can be no assurances in this regard, the Company expects that internally generated cash will be sufficient to support the working capital needs of the Company, the Companys fixed payments, dividends, and other obligations on both a short and long term basis. On February 15, 2006, the Company announced a quarterly dividend of $.08 per share to be paid to all shareholders of record on February 27, 2006. The dividend will be paid on March 15, 2006. The Companys cash flows generated from operations are also the primary source for funding various contractual obligations. The table below summarizes the Companys major commitments as of December 31, 2005 (in thousands): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations 2006 2007 and 2008 2009 and 2010 Thereafter Total Long term debt obligations $ 557 $ 1,113 $ 554 $ 2,804 $ 5,028 Operating lease obligations 72,934 115,632 74,440 24,044 287,050 Purchase obligations 19,375 10,017 29,392 Other long term liabilities 1,014 1,011 4,534 6,559 Total $ 92,866 $ 127,776 $ 76,005 $ 31,382 $ 328,029 Long term debt obligations consist of promissory notes and related interest as well as other forms of indebtedness issued in connection with certain acquisitions and other payment obligations. Operating lease obligations consist of minimum rental commitments for 2006 and thereafter under non cancelable leases in effect at December 31, 2005. Purchase obligations consist of purchase commitments primarily related to telecom service agreements, software licenses and subscriptions, and computer hardware and software maintenance agreements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The Companys exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the Companys foreign subsidiaries. Exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar value of the Companys reported earnings, investments in its foreign subsidiaries, and the intercompany transactions with its foreign subsidiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2005, approximately 19% of the Companys revenues were generated outside of the United States. These operations transact business in their functional currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar have an impact on the Companys reported results. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Consequently, as the value of the U.S. dollar changes relative to the currencies of the Companys non U.S. markets, the Companys reported results vary. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar amount of the Companys stockholders equity. The assets and liabilities of the Companys non U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. 16
