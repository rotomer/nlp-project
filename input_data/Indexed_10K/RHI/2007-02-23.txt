Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Certain information contained in Managements Discussion and Analysis and in other parts of this report may be deemed forward looking statements regarding events and financial trends that may affect the Companys future operating results or financial positions. These statements may be identified by words such as estimate, forecast, project, plan, intend, believe, expect, anticipate, or variations or negatives thereof or by similar or comparable words or phrases. Forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: changes in levels of unemployment and other economic conditions in the United States or foreign countries where the Company does business, or in particular regions or industries; reduction in the supply of candidates for temporary employment or the Companys ability to attract candidates; the entry of new competitors into the marketplace or expansion by existing competitors; the ability of the Company to maintain existing client relationships and attract new clients in the context of changing economic or competitive conditions; the impact of competitive pressures, including any change in the demand for the Companys services, on the Companys ability to maintain its margins; the possibility of the Company incurring liability for its activities, including the activities of its temporary employees, or for events impacting its temporary employees on clients premises; the possibility that adverse publicity could impact the Companys ability to attract and retain clients and candidates; the success of the Company in attracting, training, and retaining qualified management personnel and other staff employees; whether governments will impose additional regulations or licensing requirements on personnel services businesses in particular or on employer/employee relationships in general; whether there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; and litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities, including litigation that may be disclosed from time to time in the Companys SEC filings. Additionally, with respect to Protiviti, other risks and uncertainties include the fact that future success will depend on its ability to retain employees and attract clients; there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; failure to produce projected revenues could adversely affect financial results; and there is the possibility of involvement in litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities. Further information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Because long term contracts are not a significant part of the Companys business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates As described below, the Companys most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments. Accounts Receivable Allowances. The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from (i) the inability of its customers to make required payments, (ii) temporary placement sales adjustments, and (iii) permanent placement candidates not remaining with the client through the 90 day guarantee period, commonly referred to as fall offs. The Company establishes these allowances based on its review of customers credit profiles, historical loss statistics and current trends. The adequacy of these allowances is reviewed each reporting period. Historically, the Companys actual losses and credits have been consistent with these allowances. As a percentage of gross accounts receivable, the Companys accounts receivable allowances totaled 4.1% and 4.4% as of December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, a five percentage point deviation in the Companys accounts receivable allowances balance would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the allowance of $1.1 million. Although future results cannot always be predicted by extrapolating past results, management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience. However, if the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur, additional allowances may be required. Income Tax Assets and Liabilities. In establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the Company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are 11 applicable to its operations. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates, which the Company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. The likelihood of a material change in the Companys expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final U.S. and foreign tax settlements, and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions. The Company also evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts. Management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events, including operating results, to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized. When appropriate, a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized. In relation to actual net operating losses in certain foreign operations, valuation allowances of $11.5 million were recorded as of December 31, 2006. If such losses are ultimately utilized to offset future operating income, the Company will benefit its deferred tax assets up to the full amount of the valuation reserve. While management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the Company. Employee Retirement Plans. For the year ended December 31, 2005 the determination of the Companys obligations for its defined benefit retirement agreement for the Companys Chief Executive Officer was dependent upon the following assumptions: expected retirement age, mortality, expected post retirement Consumer Price Index (CPI) increases, and discount rates. These assumptions were evaluated and updated each reporting period. A historical long term average rate was used for CPI, while a current long term market rate was used for the discount rate. As of December 31, 2005 the CPI rate used in calculating the liability was 2.8%. The discount rate used in calculating this liability as of December 31, 2005 was 4.0%. Effective October 1, 2006 the Key Executive Retirement Plan (the Retirement Agreement) and the Companys Deferred Compensation Plan (the DCP) were amended. Future benefit accruals under the Retirement Agreement were frozen and converted from a traditional defined benefit plan into a deferred compensation arrangement within the DCP with market rate interest amounts credited in the future on the converted amount. The balance in the Retirement Agreement as of October 1, 2006 of $49 million, calculated by the Company and its independent actuarial advisors, was transferred to the DCP. As of December 31, 2006, employee benefit and retirement obligations included $53 million for the Companys Chief Executive Officer for the DCP and other benefits. Goodwill Impairment. The Company assesses the impairment of goodwill annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment assessments for goodwill are done at a reporting unit level. For purposes of this assessment, the Companys reporting units are its lines of business. In performing periodic impairment tests, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to the carrying value, including goodwill and intangible assets. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, however, an impairment condition exists. The goodwill impairment assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. The estimate of future cash flows is based upon, among other things, a discount rate and certain assumptions about expected future operating performance. The discount rate used by management has been calculated on a consistent basis and has not fluctuated significantly. The primary assumptions related to future operating performance include revenue growth rates and expense levels. These assumptions are updated annually and are primarily based upon historical trends. Although management does not anticipate that these assumptions will change materially in the future, the Companys estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required. Based upon the Companys 12 most recent goodwill impairment analysis, management believes that unless a reporting unit were to be abandoned, the possibility of goodwill impairment as a result of a change in assumptions is unlikely. Workers Compensation. Except for states which require participation in state operated insurance funds, the Company retains the economic burden for the first $0.5 million per occurrence in workers compensation claims. Workers compensation includes ongoing healthcare and indemnity coverage for claims and may be paid over numerous years following the date of injury. Claims in excess of $0.5 million are insured. Workers compensation expense includes the insurance premiums for claims in excess of $0.5 million, claims administration fees charged by the Companys workers compensation administrator, premiums paid to state operated insurance funds, and an estimate for the Companys liability for Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims. Total workers compensation expense was $12.4 million and $11.4 million, representing 0.39% and 0.42% of applicable U.S. revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The accrual for IBNR claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims in each reporting period includes estimates. The Company has established reserves for workers compensation claims using loss development rates which are estimated using periodic third party actuarial valuations based upon historical loss statistics which include the Companys historical frequency and severity of workers compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. While management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the Companys future results. Based on the Companys results for the year ended December 31, 2006, a five percentage point deviation in the Companys estimated loss development rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the allowance of $0.5 million. Stock based Compensation. Under various stock plans, officers, employees, and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock, stock units, stock appreciation rights or options to purchase common stock. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), using the modified prospective transition method; accordingly, prior periods have not been restated. Stock based compensation expense recognized in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements (Financial Statements) for the year ended December 31, 2006 included compensation expense for stock options, which includes grants made prior to, but not yet vested as of December 31, 2005, as well as stock options granted during the year ended December 31, 2006. Beginning in 2005, the Company significantly decreased its use of stock options as part of its compensation programs. For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Companys pre tax stock based compensation cost from options totaled $17.6 million. Under both SFAS No. 123 (SFAS 123), Accounting for Stock Based Compensation and SFAS 123(R) the Company determined the fair value of stock options using the Black Scholes valuation model. SFAS 123(R) requires the Company to recognize compensation expense for only the portion of restricted stock and stock units that is expected to vest, rather than record forfeitures when they occur, as previously permitted. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods. For the year ended December 31, 2006, compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units was $40.8 million, of which $10.2 million was related to grants made in 2006. A one percentage point deviation in the estimated forfeiture rates would have resulted in a $0.4 million increase or decrease in compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units for the year ended December 31, 2006. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments An Amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140 (SFAS 155). 13 SFAS 155 allows financial instruments that have embedded derivatives to be accounted for as a whole (eliminating the need to bifurcate the derivative from its host) if the holder elects to account for the whole instrument on a fair value basis. This statement is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 155 to have a material impact on its Financial Statements. In March 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets An Amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS 156). SFAS 156 provides some relief for entities that use derivatives to economically hedge fluctuations in the fair value of their servicing rights and changes how gains and losses are computed in certain transfers or securitizations. SFAS 156 is effective as of the beginning of the first fiscal year that begins after September 15, 2006. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys Financial Statements. In June 2006, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06 3, How Taxes Collected from Customers and Remitted to Governmental Authorities Should Be Presented in the Income Statement (That Is, Gross Versus Net Presentation). This standard allows companies to present in their statements of operations any taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are directly imposed on revenue producing transactions between a seller and a customer, such as sales, use, value added and some excise taxes, on either a gross (included in revenues and costs) or a net (excluded from revenues) basis. This standard will be effective for the Company in interim periods and fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The Company presents these transactions on a net basis and intends to continue this presentation in the future, therefore the adoption of this standard will have no impact on its Financial Statements. In July 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. FIN 48 prescribes a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize, measure, present, and disclose in its financial statements uncertain tax positions that the company has taken or expects to take on a tax return. The Company does not expect the adoption of FIN 48 to have a material impact on its Financial Statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. SFAS 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements. SFAS 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. Earlier adoption is permitted, provided the company has not yet issued financial statements, including for interim periods, for that fiscal year. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 to have a material impact on its Financial Statements. In September 2006, the FASB ratified EITF Issue No. 06 4, Accounting for Deferred Compensation and Postretirement Benefit Aspects of Endorsement Split Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements (EITF 06 4). EITF 06 4 indicates that an employer should recognize a liability for future post employment benefits based on the substantive agreement with the employee, and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2007. The Company will adopt EITF 06 4 as required and does not expect a material impact on its Financial Statements. In September 2006, the EITF reached a consensus on EITF Issue 06 5, Accounting for Purchases of Life Insurance Determining the Amount That Could Be Realized in Accordance with FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85 4 (EITF 06 5). EITF 06 5 requires that a policyholder should consider any additional amounts included in the contractual terms of the policy in determining the amount that could be realized under the insurance contract on a policy by policy basis. EITF 06 5 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006 and it requires that recognition of the effects of adoption should be either by (a) a change in accounting principle through a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the year of adoption or (b) a change in accounting principle through retrospective application to all prior periods. The Company does not expect the adoption of EITF 06 5 to have a material impact on its Financial Statements. 14 Results of Operations for the Three Years Ended December 31, 2006 Temporary and consultant staffing services revenues were $3.1 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, increasing by 19% and 21% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Permanent placement revenues were $336 million, $219 million and $136 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, increasing by 53% and 61% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Improvement in the U.S. labor markets contributed to the increase in temporary and permanent staffing services revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were $543 million, $479 million and $352 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, increasing by 13% and 36% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2006 increase in risk consulting and internal audit services revenues is primarily due to higher international revenues, particularly in Asia. The 2005 increase in risk consulting and internal audit services revenues is primarily due to increased brand acceptance in the marketplace and expanding demand related to increased focus on internal accounting controls and other corporate governance requirements, including the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. There can be no assurances that there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes Oxley or other regulatory compliance services, or that future results can be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. We expect total Company revenues to continue to be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in 2007. The Companys temporary and permanent staffing services business has more than 350 offices in 42 states, the District of Columbia and 17 foreign countries, while Protiviti has more than 55 offices in 22 states and 14 foreign countries. Revenues from foreign operations represented 21%, 19% and 18% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Gross margin dollars from the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist of payroll, payroll taxes and insurance costs for temporary employees. Gross margin dollars from permanent placement staffing services are equal to revenues, as there are no direct costs associated with such revenues. Gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist primarily of professional staff payroll, payroll taxes, insurance costs and reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services were $1.2 billion, $963 million and $787 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, increasing by 20% and 22% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Gross margin amounts equaled 37%, 36% and 36% of revenues for temporary and consultant staffing services for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The higher 2006 temporary and consultant gross margin percentage is primarily the result of higher bill rates and conversion revenues. Conversion revenues are earned when a temporary position converts to a permanent position. As there are no direct costs related to conversion revenues, the gross margin percentage is favorably impacted as the mix of conversion revenues increases. In the year ended December 31, 2006, the composition of temporary revenues included higher conversion revenues as compared to 2005. Gross margin dollars for the Companys permanent placement staffing division were $336 million, $219 million and $136 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, increasing by 53% and 61% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Gross margin dollars for the Companys risk consulting and internal audit division were $199 million, $190 million and $133 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, increasing by 5% and 43% in 2006 and 2005, respectively. Gross margin amounts equaled 37%, 40% and 38% of revenues for risk consulting and internal audit services for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The 2006 decrease in gross margin percentage is primarily the result of additional professional staff related to the expansion of international operations as well as lower utilization of the professional staff in the United States. The 2005 improvement in risk consulting and internal audit services gross margin dollars is primarily the result of higher revenues and improved staff utilization. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.2 billion in 2006, compared to $991 million in 2005 and $824 million in 2004. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 31%, 30% and 31% for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Selling, general and 15 administrative expenses consist primarily of staff compensation, advertising, depreciation and occupancy costs. The expensing of stock options, the higher mix of permanent placement activities, and the continuing additions to professional staff all contributed to the higher percentage of 2006 selling, general and administrative expenses. The lower 2005 selling, general and administrative expense percentage resulted primarily from leveraging fixed operating costs. For acquisitions, the Company allocates the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net tangible assets first to identifiable intangible assets, if any, and then to goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their lives, typically ranging from two to five years. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during each of the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required. Net intangible assets, consisting primarily of goodwill, represented 12% of total assets and 17% of total stockholders equity at December 31, 2006. Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $19.3 million, $12.1 million and $5.0 million, respectively, while interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 was $2.5 million, $1.1 million and $1.2 million, respectively. Higher average cash balances in 2006 and 2005 and higher interest rates during those years yielded higher interest income. The provision for income taxes was 39%, 39% and 40% of income before taxes for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The decrease in 2005 is due primarily to the diminishing impact of permanent non deductible tax items, which became increasingly less significant relative to the Companys improved financial results, and to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards in certain states and international locations. Liquidity and Capital Resources The change in the Companys liquidity during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is primarily the net effect of funds generated by operations and the funds used for capital expenditures, repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends and principal payments on outstanding notes payable. Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $447 million, $458 million and $437 million at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Operating activities provided $376 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, partially offset by $96 million and $299 million of net cash used in investing activities and financing activities, respectively. Operating activities and investing activities provided $328 million and $22 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2005, partially offset by $232 million of net cash used in financing activities. Operating activities provided $162 million during the year ended December 31, 2004, partially offset by $37 million and $76 million of net cash used in investing activities and financing activities, respectively. Operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was composed of net income of $283 million adjusted for non cash items of $58 million, and net cash provided by changes in working capital of $35 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was composed of net income of $238 million adjusted for non cash items of $122 million, and net cash used for changes in working capital of $32 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was composed of net income of $141 million adjusted for non cash items of $93 million, and net cash used for changes in working capital of $72 million. Investing activities Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $96 million. This was primarily composed of capital expenditures of $80 million, purchases of goodwill and other intangible assets of $12 million, and deposits to trusts for employee benefits and retirement plans of $4 million. Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $22 million. This 16 was primarily composed of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $92 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $62 million, purchases of goodwill and other intangible assets of $4 million, and deposits to trusts for employee benefits and retirement plans of $3 million. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $37 million. This was primarily composed of capital expenditures of $33 million. Financing activities Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $299 million. This included repurchases of $400 million in common stock and $54 million in cash dividends to stockholders, partially offset by proceeds of $105 million from exercises of stock options and the excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $50 million. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $232 million. This included repurchases of $262 million in common stock and $48 million in cash dividends to stockholders, partially offset by proceeds of $77 million from exercises of stock options. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2004 was $76 million. This included common stock repurchases of $90 million and cash dividends to stockholders of $31 million, partially offset by proceeds of $44 million from exercises of stock options. As of December 31, 2006, the Company is authorized to repurchase, from time to time, up to 11.4 million additional shares of the Companys common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, the Company repurchased approximately 7.9 million, 7.6 million and 2.7 million shares of common stock on the open market for a total cost of $273 million, $222 million and $64 million, respectively. Additional stock repurchases were made in connection with employee stock plans, whereby Company shares were tendered by employees for the payment of exercise price and applicable statutory withholding taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, such repurchases totaled approximately 3.3 million, 1.6 million and 1.0 million shares at a cost of $127 million, $53 million and $25 million, respectively. Repurchases of securities have been funded with cash generated from operations. The Companys working capital at December 31, 2006 included $447 million in cash and cash equivalents. The Companys working capital requirements relate primarily to accounts receivable. While there can be no assurances in this regard, the Company expects that internally generated cash will be sufficient to support the working capital needs of the Company, the Companys fixed payments, dividends, and other obligations on both a short and long term basis. On February 13, 2007, the Company announced a quarterly dividend of $.10 per share to be paid to all shareholders of record on February 26, 2007. The dividend will be paid on March 15, 2007. The Companys cash flows generated from operations are also the primary source for funding various contractual obligations. The table below summarizes the Companys major commitments as of December 31, 2006 (in thousands): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations 2007 2008 and 2009 2010 and 2011 Thereafter Total Long term debt obligations $ 567 $ 2,300 $ 555 $ 2,527 $ 5,949 Operating lease obligations 83,944 135,833 74,300 29,498 323,575 Purchase obligations 28,494 6,753 4 35,251 Other long term liabilities 411 1,297 772 5,258 7,738 Total $ 113,416 $ 146,183 $ 75,631 $ 37,283 $ 372,513 Long term debt obligations consist of promissory notes and related interest as well as other forms of indebtedness issued in connection with certain acquisitions and other payment obligations. Operating lease obligations consist of minimum rental commitments for 2007 and thereafter under non cancelable leases in effect at December 31, 2006. Purchase obligations consist of purchase commitments primarily related to telecom service agreements, software licenses and subscriptions, and computer hardware and software maintenance agreements. 17 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The Companys exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the Companys foreign subsidiaries. Exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar value of the Companys reported earnings, investments in its foreign subsidiaries, and the intercompany transactions with its foreign subsidiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2006, approximately 21% of the Companys revenues were generated outside of the United States. These operations transact business in their functional currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar have an impact on the Companys reported results. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Consequently, as the value of the U.S. dollar changes relative to the currencies of the Companys non U.S. markets, the Companys reported results vary. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar amount of the Companys stockholders equity. The assets and liabilities of the Companys non U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. 18
