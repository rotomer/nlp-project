Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Certain information contained in Managements Discussion and Analysis and in other parts of this report may be deemed forward looking statements regarding events and financial trends that may affect the Companys future operating results or financial positions. These statements may be identified by words such as estimate, forecast, project, plan, intend, believe, expect, anticipate, or variations or negatives thereof or by similar or comparable words or phrases. Forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: changes in levels of unemployment and other economic conditions in the United States or foreign countries where the Company does business, or in particular regions or industries; reduction in the supply of candidates for temporary employment or the Companys ability to attract candidates; the entry of new competitors into the marketplace or expansion by existing competitors; the ability of the Company to maintain existing client relationships and attract new clients in the context of changing economic or competitive conditions; the impact of competitive pressures, including any change in the demand for the Companys services, on the Companys ability to maintain its margins; the possibility of the Company incurring liability for its activities, including the activities of its temporary employees, or for events impacting its temporary employees on clients premises; the possibility that adverse publicity could impact the Companys ability to attract and retain clients and candidates; the success of the Company in attracting, training, and retaining qualified management personnel and other staff employees; whether governments will impose additional regulations or licensing requirements on personnel services businesses in particular or on employer/employee relationships in general; whether there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; and litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities, including litigation that may be disclosed from time to time in the Companys SEC filings. Additionally, with respect to Protiviti, other risks and uncertainties include the fact that future success will depend on its ability to retain employees and attract clients; there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; failure to produce projected revenues could adversely affect financial results; and there is the possibility of involvement in litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities. Further information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Because long term contracts are not a significant part of the Companys business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates As described below, the Companys most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments. Accounts Receivable Allowances. The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from (i) the inability of its customers to make required payments, (ii) temporary placement sales adjustments, and (iii) permanent placement candidates not remaining with the client through the 90 day guarantee period, commonly referred to as fall offs. The Company establishes these allowances based on its review of customers credit profiles, historical loss statistics and current trends. The adequacy of these allowances is reviewed each reporting period. Historically, the Companys actual losses and credits have been consistent with these allowances. As a percentage of gross accounts receivable, the Companys accounts receivable allowances totaled 4.6% and 4.1% as of December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. As of December 31, 2007, a five percentage point deviation in the Companys accounts receivable allowances balance would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the allowance of $1.4 million. Although future results cannot always be predicted by extrapolating past results, management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience. However, if the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur, additional allowances may be required. Income Tax Assets and Liabilities. In establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the Company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are 11 applicable to its operations. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates, which the Company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. The likelihood of a material change in the Companys expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final U.S. and foreign tax settlements, and the effectiveness of its tax planning strategies in the various relevant jurisdictions. The Company also evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts. Management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events, including operating results, to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized. When appropriate, a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized. In relation to actual net operating losses in certain foreign operations, valuation allowances of $12.7 million were recorded as of December 31, 2007. If such losses are ultimately utilized to offset future operating income, the Company will benefit its deferred tax assets up to the full amount of the valuation reserve. While management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the Company. Goodwill Impairment. The Company assesses the impairment of goodwill annually, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment assessments for goodwill are done at a reporting unit level. For purposes of this assessment, the Companys reporting units are its lines of business. In performing periodic impairment tests, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to the carrying value, including goodwill and intangible assets. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, however, an impairment condition may exist. The goodwill impairment assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. The estimate of future cash flows is based upon, among other things, a discount rate and certain assumptions about expected future operating performance. The discount rate used by management has been calculated on a consistent basis and has not fluctuated significantly. The primary assumptions related to future operating performance include revenue growth rates and expense levels. These assumptions are updated annually and are primarily based upon historical trends. Although management does not anticipate that these assumptions will change materially in the future, the Companys estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required. Based upon the Companys most recent goodwill impairment analysis, management believes that unless a reporting unit were to be abandoned, the possibility of goodwill impairment as a result of a change in assumptions is unlikely. Workers Compensation. Except for states which require participation in state operated insurance funds, the Company retains the economic burden for the first $0.5 million per occurrence in workers compensation claims. Workers compensation includes ongoing healthcare and indemnity coverage for claims and may be paid over numerous years following the date of injury. Claims in excess of $0.5 million are insured. Workers compensation expense includes the insurance premiums for claims in excess of $0.5 million, claims administration fees charged by the Companys workers compensation administrator, premiums paid to state operated insurance funds, and an estimate for the Companys liability for Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims. Total workers compensation expense was $9.4 and $12.4 million, representing 0.27% and 0.39% of applicable U.S. revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The accrual for IBNR claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims in each reporting period includes estimates. The Company has established reserves for workers compensation claims using loss 12 development rates which are estimated using periodic third party actuarial valuations based upon historical loss statistics which include the Companys historical frequency and severity of workers compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. While management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the Companys future results. Based on the Companys results for the year ended December 31, 2007, a five percentage point deviation in the Companys estimated loss development rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the allowance of $0.3 million. Stock based Compensation. Under various stock plans, officers, employees, and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock, stock units, stock appreciation rights or options to purchase common stock. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)), using the modified prospective transition method; accordingly, prior periods have not been restated. Stock based compensation expense recognized in the Companys Consolidated Financial Statements (Financial Statements) for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 included compensation expense for stock options, which includes grants made prior to, but not yet vested as of December 31, 2005, as well as stock options granted subsequent to December 31, 2005. Beginning in 2005, the Company significantly decreased its use of stock options as part of its compensation programs. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Companys pre tax stock based compensation cost from options totaled $9.2 million and $17.6 million, respectively. Under both SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation (SFAS 123), and SFAS 123(R) the Company determined the fair value of stock options using the Black Scholes valuation model. SFAS 123(R) requires the Company to recognize compensation expense for only the portion of restricted stock and stock units that is expected to vest, rather than record forfeitures when they occur, as previously permitted. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods. For the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units was $53.8 million and $40.8 million, respectively, of which $21.1 million and $10.2 million was related to grants made in 2007 and 2006, respectively. A one percentage point deviation in the estimated forfeiture rates would have resulted in a $0.5 million and $0.4 million increase or decrease in compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159), which gives entities the option to measure eligible financial assets, and financial liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis, that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting standards. The election to use the fair value option is available when an entity first recognizes a financial asset or financial liability. Subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings. This statement is effective as of January 1, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 159 to have a material impact on its Financial Statements. In June 2007, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 06 11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share Based Payment Awards (EITF 06 11). EITF 06 11 requires that tax benefits generated by dividends paid during the vesting period on certain equity classified share based compensation awards be classified as additional paid in capital and included in a pool of excess tax benefits available to absorb tax deficiencies from share based payment awards. EITF 06 11 is effective as of January 1, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of EITF 06 11 to have a material impact on its Financial Statements. 13 In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, and the goodwill acquired. SFAS No. 141(R) also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS No. 141(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is in the process of analyzing the impact of SFAS No. 141(R) on its Financial Statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a parents ownership interest, and the valuation of retained, noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS No. 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS No. 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company is in the process of analyzing the impact of SFAS No. 160 on its Financial Statements. Results of Operations for the Three Years Ended December 31, 2007 Temporary and consultant staffing services revenues were $3.6 billion, $3.1 billion and $2.6 billion for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, increasing by 16% and 19% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. On a constant currency basis, temporary and consultant staffing services revenues increased 14% and 18% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Permanent placement revenues were $444 million, $336 million and $219 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, increasing by 32% and 53% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. On a constant currency basis, permanent placement services revenues increased 29% and 52% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Improvement in both domestic and international markets, particularly Continental Europe, contributed to the increase in temporary and permanent staffing services revenues for the year ended December 31, 2007. Risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were $552 million, $543 million and $479 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, increasing by 2% and 13% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. On a constant currency basis, risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were flat and increased 13% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The 2007 increase in risk consulting and internal audit services revenues is primarily due to higher international revenues, particularly in Asia. There can be no assurances that there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes Oxley or other regulatory compliance services, or that future results can be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. We expect total Company revenues to continue to be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in 2008. The Companys temporary and permanent staffing services business has more than 360 offices in 42 states, the District of Columbia and eighteen foreign countries, while Protiviti has 60 offices in 22 states and fourteen foreign countries. Revenues from foreign operations represented 24%, 21% and 19% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Gross margin dollars from the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist of payroll, payroll taxes and insurance costs for temporary employees, and reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars from permanent placement staffing services represent revenues less reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist primarily of professional staff payroll, payroll taxes, insurance costs and reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services were $1.4 billion, $1.2 billion and $963 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, increasing by 17% and 20% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. On a constant currency 14 basis, temporary and consultant staffing services gross margin dollars increased 15% and 18% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Gross margin amounts equaled 37%, 37% and 36% of revenues for temporary and consultant staffing services for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Gross margin dollars for the Companys permanent placement staffing division were $444 million, $336 million and $219 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, increasing by 32% and 53% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. On a constant currency basis, permanent placement staffing services gross margin dollars increased 29% and 52% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Gross margin dollars for the Companys risk consulting and internal audit division were $175 million, $199 million and $190 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, decreasing by 12% in 2007 and increasing by 5% in 2006. On a constant currency basis, risk consulting and internal audit services gross margin dollars decreased 13% and increased 5% for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Gross margin amounts equaled 32%, 37% and 40% of revenues for risk consulting and internal audit services for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The 2007 and 2006 decreases in gross margin percentage are primarily the result of additional professional staff related to the expansion of international operations as well as lower utilization of the professional staff in the United States. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.5 billion in 2007, compared to $1.2 billion in 2006 and $991 million in 2005. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 32%, 31% and 30% for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of staff compensation, advertising, depreciation and occupancy costs. The 2007 increase relates primarily to higher staff compensation costs. For acquisitions, the Company allocates the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net tangible assets first to identifiable intangible assets, if any, and then to goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their lives, typically ranging from two to five years. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during each of the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required. Net intangible assets, consisting primarily of goodwill, represented 13% of total assets and 20% of total stockholders equity at December 31, 2007. Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $17.2 million, $19.3 million and $12.1 million, respectively. Lower 2007 interest income resulted from lower average cash balances, partially offset by higher interest rates. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $4.1 million, $2.5 million and $1.1 million, respectively. The provision for income taxes was 40%, 39% and 39% of income before taxes for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Liquidity and Capital Resources The change in the Companys liquidity during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is primarily the net effect of funds generated by operations and the funds used for capital expenditures, repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends and principal payments on outstanding notes payable. Cash and cash equivalents were $310 million, $447 million and $458 million at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Operating activities provided $411 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by $116 million and $452 million of net cash used in investing activities and financing activities, respectively. Operating activities provided $376 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, partially 15 offset by $96 million and $299 million of net cash used in investing activities and financing activities, respectively. Operating activities and investing actives provided $328 million and $22 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2005, partially offset by $232 million of net cash used in financing activities. Operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was composed of net income of $296 million adjusted for non cash items of $124 million, and net cash used by changes in working capital of $9 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was composed of net income of $283 million adjusted for non cash items of $58 million, and net cash provided by changes in working capital of $35 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was composed of net income of $238 million adjusted for non cash items of $122 million, and net cash used for changes in working capital of $32 million. Investing activities Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $116 million. This was composed of capital expenditures of $84 million, purchases of goodwill and other intangible assets of $19 million, and deposits to trusts for employee benefits and retirement plans of $13 million. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $96 million. This was composed of capital expenditures of $80 million, purchases of goodwill and other intangible assets of $12 million, and deposits to trusts for employee benefits and retirement plans of $4 million. Cash provided by investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $22 million. This was primarily composed of proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $92 million, partially offset by capital expenditures of $62 million, purchases of goodwill and other intangible assets of $4 million, and deposits to trusts for employee benefits and retirement plans of $3 million. Financing activities Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007 was $452 million. This included repurchases of $453 million in common stock and $66 million in cash dividends to stockholders, partially offset by proceeds of $52 million from exercises of stock options and the excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $15 million. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006 was $299 million. This included repurchases of $400 million in common stock and $54 million in cash dividends to stockholders, partially offset by proceeds of $105 million from exercises of stock options and the excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $50 million. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was $232 million. This included repurchases of $262 million in common stock and $48 million in cash dividends to stockholders, partially offset by proceeds of $77 million from exercises of stock options. As of December 31, 2007, the Company is authorized to repurchase, from time to time, up to 9.2 million additional shares of the Companys common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, the Company repurchased approximately 12.2 million shares, 7.9 million shares and 7.6 million shares of common stock on the open market for a total cost of $397 million, $273 million and $222 million, respectively. Additional stock repurchases were made in connection with employee stock plans, whereby Company shares were tendered by employees for the payment of exercise price and applicable statutory withholding taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, such repurchases totaled approximately 1.6 million shares, 3.3 million shares and 1.6 million shares at a cost of $58 million, $127 million and $53 million, respectively. Repurchases of securities have been funded with cash generated from operations. The Companys working capital at December 31, 2007 included $310 million in cash and cash equivalents. The Companys working capital requirements relate primarily to accounts receivable. While there can be no assurances in this regard, the Company expects that internally generated cash will be sufficient to support the working capital needs of the Company, the Companys fixed payments, dividends, and other obligations on both a short and long term basis. 16 On February 13, 2008, the Company announced a quarterly dividend of $.11 per share to be paid to all shareholders of record on February 25, 2008. The dividend will be paid on March 14, 2008. The Companys cash flows generated from operations are also the primary source for funding various contractual obligations. The table below summarizes the Companys major commitments as of December 31, 2007 (in thousands): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations 2008 2009 and 2010 2011 and 2012 Thereafter Total Long term debt obligations $ 629 $ 2,334 $ 534 $ 2,271 $ 5,768 Operating lease obligations 98,421 164,103 78,489 25,435 366,448 Purchase obligations 24,841 11,199 36,040 Other liabilities 416 1,256 629 7,551 9,852 Total $ 124,307 $ 178,892 $ 79,652 $ 35,257 $ 418,108 Long term debt obligations consist of promissory notes and related interest as well as other forms of indebtedness issued in connection with certain acquisitions and other payment obligations. Operating lease obligations consist of minimum rental commitments for 2008 and thereafter under non cancelable leases in effect at December 31, 2007. Purchase obligations consist of purchase commitments primarily related to telecom service agreements, software licenses and subscriptions, and computer hardware and software maintenance agreements. The above table does not reflect $5.8 million of unrecognized tax benefits which the Company has accrued for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. As of December 31, 2007, the Company classified $3.5 million of its unrecognized tax benefits as a current liability, as these amounts are expected to be paid in the next twelve months. The remaining $2.3 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been classified as a non current liability, as a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of future payments, if any, could not be determined. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The Companys exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the Companys foreign subsidiaries. Exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar value of the Companys reported earnings, investments in its foreign subsidiaries, and the intercompany transactions with its foreign subsidiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2007, approximately 24% of the Companys revenues were generated outside of the United States. These operations transact business in their functional currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar have an impact on the Companys reported results. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Consequently, as the value of the U.S. dollar changes relative to the currencies of the Companys non U.S. markets, the Companys reported results vary. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar amount of the Companys stockholders equity. The assets and liabilities of the Companys non U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. 17
