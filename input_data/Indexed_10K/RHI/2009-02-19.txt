Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Certain information contained in Managements Discussion and Analysis and in other parts of this report may be deemed forward looking statements regarding events and financial trends that may affect the Companys future operating results or financial positions. These statements may be identified by words such as estimate, forecast, project, plan, intend, believe, expect, anticipate, or variations or negatives thereof or by similar or comparable words or phrases. Forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: the global financial and economic situation; changes in levels of unemployment and other economic conditions in the United States or foreign countries where the Company does business, or in particular regions or industries; reduction in the supply of candidates for temporary employment or the Companys ability to attract candidates; the entry of new competitors into the marketplace or expansion by existing competitors; the ability of the Company to maintain existing client relationships and attract new clients in the context of changing economic or competitive conditions; the impact of competitive pressures, including any change in the demand for the Companys services, on the Companys ability to maintain its margins; the possibility of the Company incurring liability for its activities, including the activities of its temporary employees, or for events impacting its temporary employees on clients premises; the possibility that adverse publicity could impact the Companys ability to attract and retain clients and candidates; the success of the Company in attracting, training, and retaining qualified management personnel and other staff employees; the Companys ability to comply with governmental regulations affecting personnel services businesses in particular or employer/employee relationships in general; whether there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; the Companys reliance on short term contracts for a significant percentage of its business; litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities, including litigation that may be disclosed from time to time in the Companys SEC filings; the ability of the Company to manage its international operations and comply with foreign laws and regulations; the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the possibility that the Companys computer and communications hardware and software systems could be damaged or their service interrupted; and the possibility that the Company may fail to maintain adequate financial and management controls and as a result suffer errors in its financial reporting. Additionally, with respect to Protiviti, other risks and uncertainties include the fact that future success will depend on its ability to retain employees and attract clients; there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; failure to produce projected revenues could adversely affect financial results; and there is the possibility of involvement in litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities. Further information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Because long term contracts are not a significant part of the Companys business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates As described below, the Companys most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments. Accounts Receivable Allowances. The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from (i) the inability of its customers to make required payments, (ii) temporary placement sales adjustments, and (iii) permanent placement candidates not remaining with the client through the 90 day guarantee period, commonly referred to as fall offs. The Company establishes these allowances based on its review of customers credit profiles, historical loss statistics and current trends. The adequacy of these allowances is reviewed each reporting period. Historically, the Companys actual losses and credits have been consistent with these allowances. As a percentage of gross accounts receivable, the Companys accounts receivable allowances totaled 6.6% and 4.6% as of December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. As of December 31, 2008, a five percentage point deviation in the Companys accounts receivable allowances balance would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the allowance of $1.7 million. Although future results cannot always be predicted by extrapolating past results, management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience. However, if the financial condition of the Companys customers were to 12 deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur, additional allowances may be required. Income Tax Assets and Liabilities. In establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the Company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to its operations. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates, which the Company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. The likelihood of a material change in the Companys expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final U.S. and foreign tax settlements, and the effectiveness of its tax planning in the various relevant jurisdictions. The Company also evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts. Management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events, including operating results, to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized. When appropriate, a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized. In relation to actual net operating losses in certain foreign operations, valuation allowances of $14.6 million were recorded as of December 31, 2008. If such losses are ultimately utilized to offset future operating income, the Company will benefit its deferred tax assets up to the full amount of the valuation reserve. While management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the Company. Goodwill Impairment. The Company assesses the impairment of goodwill annually in the second quarter, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable. Impairment assessments for goodwill are done at a reporting unit level. For purposes of this assessment, the Companys reporting units are its lines of business. In performing periodic impairment tests, the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to the carrying value, including goodwill and intangible assets. If the fair value exceeds the carrying value, there is no impairment. If the carrying value exceeds the fair value, however, an impairment condition may exist. The goodwill impairment assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. The estimate of future cash flows is based upon, among other things, a discount rate and certain assumptions about expected future operating performance. The discount rate used by management has been calculated on a consistent basis and has not fluctuated significantly. The primary assumptions related to future operating performance include revenue growth rates and expense levels. These assumptions are updated annually and are primarily based upon historical trends. The Companys estimates of discounted cash flow may differ from actual cash flow due to, among other things, economic conditions, changes to its business model or changes in its operating performance. Although management believes the assumptions and estimates made in its goodwill impairment analysis to be reasonable and appropriate, different assumptions could materially impact the Companys reported financial results. As of December 31, 2008 and 2007, total goodwill equaled $187.5 million and $191.1 million, respectively. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during each of the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required. Workers Compensation. Except for states which require participation in state operated insurance funds, the Company retains the economic burden for the first $0.5 million per occurrence in workers compensation claims. Workers compensation includes ongoing healthcare and indemnity coverage for claims and may be paid over numerous years following the date of injury. Claims in excess of $0.5 million are insured. Workers compensation expense includes the insurance premiums for claims in excess of $0.5 million, claims administration fees charged by the Companys workers compensation administrator, premiums paid to state operated insurance funds, and an estimate for the Companys liability for Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims. Total workers compensation expense was $12.1 13 million and $9.4 million, representing 0.37% and 0.27% of applicable U.S. revenue for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The accrual for IBNR claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims in each reporting period includes estimates. The Company has established reserves for workers compensation claims using loss development rates which are estimated using periodic third party actuarial valuations based upon historical loss statistics which include the Companys historical frequency and severity of workers compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. While management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the Companys future results. Based on the Companys results for the year ended December 31, 2008, a five percentage point deviation in the Companys estimated loss development rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the reserve of $0.5 million. Stock based Compensation. Under various stock plans, officers, employees and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock, stock units, stock appreciation rights or options to purchase common stock. Compensation expense for restricted stock and stock units is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the stocks fair market value on the grant date. For restricted stock grants issued with performance conditions, compensation expense is recognized over each vesting tranche. The Company recognizes compensation expense for only the portion of restricted stock and stock units that is expected to vest, rather than record forfeitures when they occur. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods. For purposes of calculating stock based compensation expense for retirement eligible employees, the service period is assumed to be met on the grant date or retirement eligible date, whichever is later. No stock appreciation rights have been granted under the Companys existing stock plans. The Company determines the fair value of options to purchase common stock using the Black Scholes valuation model. The Company recognizes expense over the service period for options that are expected to vest and records adjustments to compensation expense at the end of the service period if actual forfeitures differ from original estimates. The Company has not granted any options to purchase common stock since 2006. For the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units was $63.6 million, $53.8 million and $40.8 million, respectively, of which $17.0 million, $21.1 million and $10.2 million was related to grants made in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. A one percentage point deviation in the estimated forfeiture rates would have resulted in a $0.6 million, $0.5 million and $0.4 million increase or decrease in compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 141(R), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)). SFAS 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed, any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree, and the goodwill acquired. SFAS 141(R) also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination. SFAS 141(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 141(R) to have a material effect on its Financial Statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements an amendment of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51 (SFAS 160). SFAS 160 establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent, the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest, changes in a 14 parents ownership interest, and the valuation of retained, noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated. SFAS 160 also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners. SFAS 160 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 160 to have a material effect on its Financial Statements. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements. Subsequently in February 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 157 2, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157, which delays the effective date of SFAS 157 for non financial assets and liabilities, except for items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The implementation of SFAS 157 for financial assets and liabilities, effective January 1, 2008, did not impact the Companys consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 157 for non financial assets and liabilities to have a material effect on its Financial Statements. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures About Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities an amendment of FASB Statement No. 133 (SFAS 161). SFAS 161 expands quarterly disclosure requirements included in SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), about an entitys derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS No. 161 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of SFAS 161 to have a material effect on its Financial Statements. In June 2008, the FASB issued Staff Position No. EITF 03 6 1, Determining Whether Instruments Granted in Share Based Payment Transactions Are Participating Securities (FSP EITF 03 6 1). FSP EITF 03 6 1 provides that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends are participating securities and should be included in the computation of earnings per share pursuant to the two class method. FSP EITF 03 6 1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. The Company does not expect the adoption of FSP EITF 03 6 1 to have a material effect on its Financial Statements. Results of Operations for the Three Years Ended December 31, 2008 Temporary and consultant staffing services revenues were $3.6 billion, $3.6 billion and $3.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, remaining flat in 2008 and increasing by 16% in 2007. Because fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have an impact on revenue, the Company provides selected growth results on a constant currency basis. Constant currency percentages are calculated using as reported amounts which have been retranslated using the prior years foreign currency exchange rates. On a constant currency basis, temporary and consultant staffing services revenues decreased 1% and increased 14% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Permanent placement revenues were $427 million, $444 million and $336 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, decreasing by 4% in 2008 and increasing by 32% in 2007. On a constant currency basis, permanent placement services revenues decreased 5% and increased 29% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2008 decrease in temporary and permanent staffing services revenues was the result of weakening general macroeconomic conditions in the United States, partially offset by higher international revenues, particularly in Continental Europe. Risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were $547 million, $552 million and $543 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, decreasing by 1% in 2008 and increasing by 2% in 2007. On a constant currency basis, risk consulting and internal audit services revenues decreased 2% and were flat for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2008 decrease in risk consulting and internal audit services revenues was the result of difficult global economic conditions which weakened as the year progressed. There can be no assurances that there will be ongoing demand for risk consulting and internal audit services, or that future results can be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. We expect total Company revenues to continue to be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in 2009. 15 The Companys temporary and permanent staffing services business has more than 370 offices in 42 states, the District of Columbia and 20 foreign countries, while Protiviti has more than 60 offices in 23 states and 16 foreign countries. Revenues from foreign operations represented 29%, 24% and 21% of revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Gross margin dollars from the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist of payroll, payroll taxes and insurance costs for temporary employees, and reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars from permanent placement staffing services represent revenues less reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist primarily of professional staff payroll, payroll taxes, insurance costs and reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services were $1.3 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.2 billion for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, decreasing by 2% in 2008 and increasing by 17% in 2007. On a constant currency basis, temporary and consultant staffing services gross margin dollars decreased 3% and increased 15% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Gross margin amounts equaled 37% of revenues for temporary and consultant staffing services for each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. Gross margin dollars for the Companys permanent placement staffing division were $427 million, $444 million and $336 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, decreasing by 4% in 2008 and increasing by 32% in 2007. On a constant currency basis, permanent placement staffing services gross margin dollars decreased 5% and increased 29% for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Gross margin dollars for the Companys risk consulting and internal audit division were $155 million, $175 million and $199 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, decreasing by 11% and 12% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. On a constant currency basis, risk consulting and internal audit services gross margin dollars decreased by 13% for both the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Gross margin amounts equaled 28%, 32% and 37% of revenues for risk consulting and internal audit services for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The year over year margin decline is primarily due to the higher mix of non U.S. revenues. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.5 billion in 2008, compared to $1.5 billion in 2007 and $1.2 billion in 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were 33%, 32% and 31% for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of staff compensation, advertising, depreciation and occupancy costs. For acquisitions, the Company allocates the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net tangible assets first to identifiable intangible assets, if any, and then to goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their lives, typically ranging from two to five years. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during each of the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required. Net intangible assets, consisting primarily of goodwill, represented 13% of total assets and 19% of total stockholders equity at December 31, 2008. Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, was $10.5 million, $17.2 million and $19.3 million, respectively. Lower 2008 interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, was $5.3 million, $4.1 million and $2.5 million, respectively. The provision for income taxes was 40%, 40% and 39% of income before taxes for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. 16 Liquidity and Capital Resources The change in the Companys liquidity during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, is primarily the net effect of funds generated by operations and the funds used for capital expenditures, repurchases of common stock, payment of dividends and principal payments on outstanding notes payable. Cash and cash equivalents were $355 million, $310 million and $447 million at December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Operating activities provided $447 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, partially offset by $95 million and $285 million of net cash used in investing activities and financing activities, respectively. Operating activities provided $411 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, partially offset by $116 million and $452 million of net cash used in investing activities and financing activities, respectively. Operating activities provided $376 million during the year ended December 31, 2006, partially offset by $96 million and $299 million of net cash used in investing activities and financing activities, respectively. Operating activities Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2008, was composed of net income of $250 million adjusted for non cash items of $150 million, and net cash provided by changes in working capital of $47 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2007, was composed of net income of $296 million adjusted for non cash items of $124 million, and net cash used by changes in working capital of $9 million. Net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2006, was composed of net income of $283 million adjusted for non cash items of $58 million, and net cash provided by changes in working capital of $35 million. Investing activities Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2008, was $95 million. This was primarily composed of capital expenditures of $73 million and deposits to trusts for employee benefits and retirement plans of $21 million. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007, was $116 million. This was composed of capital expenditures of $84 million, purchases of goodwill and other intangible assets of $19 million, and deposits to trusts for employee benefits and retirement plans of $13 million. Cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $96 million. This was composed of capital expenditures of $80 million, purchases of goodwill and other intangible assets of $12 million, and deposits to trusts for employee benefits and retirement plans of $4 million. Financing activities Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2008, was $285 million. This included repurchases of $245 million in common stock, $69 million in cash dividends to stockholders and principal payments on notes payable and other indebtedness of $2 million, offset by proceeds of $27 million from exercises of stock options and the excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $4 million. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2007, was $452 million. This included repurchases of $453 million in common stock and $66 million in cash dividends to stockholders, partially offset by proceeds of $52 million from exercises of stock options and the excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $15 million. Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2006, was $299 million. This included repurchases of $400 million in common stock and $54 million in cash dividends to stockholders, partially offset by proceeds of $105 million from exercises of stock options and the excess tax benefits from stock based compensation of $50 million. As of December 31, 2008, the Company is authorized to repurchase, from time to time, up to 9.8 million additional shares of the Companys common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, the Company repurchased approximately 9.4 million shares, 12.2 million shares and 7.9 million shares of common stock on the open market for a total cost of $203 million, $397 million and $273 million, respectively. Additional stock repurchases were made in connection with employee stock plans, whereby Company shares were tendered by employees for the payment of exercise price and applicable statutory withholding taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, such repurchases totaled approximately 1.6 million shares, 1.6 million shares and 3.3 million shares at a cost of $42 million, $58 million and $127 million, respectively. Repurchases of shares have been funded with cash generated from operations. 17 The Companys working capital at December 31, 2008, included $355 million in cash and cash equivalents. The Companys working capital requirements relate primarily to accounts receivable. While there can be no assurances in this regard, the Company expects that internally generated cash will be sufficient to support the working capital needs of the Company, the Companys fixed payments, dividends, and other obligations on both a short and long term basis. On February 12, 2009, the Company announced a quarterly dividend of $.12 per share to be paid to all shareholders of record on February 25, 2009. The dividend will be paid on March 16, 2009. The Companys cash flows generated from operations are also the primary source for funding various contractual obligations. The table below summarizes the Companys major commitments as of December 31, 2008 (in thousands): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations 2009 2010 and 2011 2012 and 2013 Thereafter Total Long term debt obligations $ 278 $ 555 $ 508 $ 2,019 $ 3,360 Operating lease obligations 109,281 176,551 95,151 127,577 508,560 Purchase obligations 15,702 4,760 18 20,480 Other liabilities 1,069 2,709 5,271 7,156 16,205 Total $ 126,330 $ 184,575 $ 100,948 $ 136,752 $ 548,605 Long term debt obligations consist of promissory notes and related interest as well as other forms of indebtedness issued in connection with certain acquisitions and other payment obligations. Operating lease obligations consist of minimum rental commitments for 2009 and thereafter under non cancelable leases in effect at December 31, 2008. Purchase obligations consist of purchase commitments primarily related to telecom service agreements, software licenses and subscriptions, and computer hardware and software maintenance agreements. The above table does not reflect $20.5 million of unrecognized tax benefits which the Company has accrued for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. As of December 31, 2008, the Company classified $18.4 million of its unrecognized tax benefits as a current liability, as these amounts are expected to be paid in the next twelve months. The remaining $2.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been classified as a non current liability, as a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of future payments, if any, could not be determined. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The Companys exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the Companys foreign subsidiaries. Exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar value of the Companys reported earnings, investments in its foreign subsidiaries, and the intercompany transactions with its foreign subsidiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2008, approximately 29% of the Companys revenues were generated outside of the United States. These operations transact business in their functional currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar have an impact on the Companys reported results. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Consequently, as the value of the U.S. dollar changes relative to the currencies of the Companys non U.S. markets, the Companys reported results vary. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar amount of the Companys stockholders equity. The assets and liabilities of the Companys non U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. 18
