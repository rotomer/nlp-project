Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Certain information contained in Managements Discussion and Analysis and in other parts of this report may be deemed forward looking statements regarding events and financial trends that may affect the Companys future operating results or financial positions. These statements may be identified by words such as estimate, forecast, project, plan, intend, believe, expect, anticipate, or variations or negatives thereof or by similar or comparable words or phrases. Forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: the global financial and economic situation; changes in levels of unemployment and other economic conditions in the United States or foreign countries where the Company does business, or in particular regions or industries; reduction in the supply of candidates for temporary employment or the Companys ability to attract candidates; the entry of new competitors into the marketplace or expansion by existing competitors; the ability of the Company to maintain existing client relationships and attract new clients in the context of changing economic or competitive conditions; the impact of competitive pressures, including any change in the demand for the Companys services, on the Companys ability to maintain its margins; the possibility of the Company incurring liability for its activities, including the activities of its temporary employees, or for events impacting its temporary employees on clients premises; the possibility that adverse publicity could impact the Companys ability to attract and retain clients and candidates; the success of the Company in attracting, training, and retaining qualified management personnel and other staff employees; the Companys ability to comply with governmental regulations affecting personnel services businesses in particular or employer/employee relationships in general; whether there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; the Companys reliance on short term contracts for a significant percentage of its business; litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities, including litigation that may be disclosed from time to time in the Companys SEC filings; the ability of the Company to manage its international operations and comply with foreign laws and regulations; the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the possibility that the Companys computer and communications hardware and software systems could be damaged or their service interrupted; and the possibility that the Company may fail to maintain adequate financial and management controls and as a result suffer errors in its financial reporting. Additionally, with respect to Protiviti, other risks and uncertainties include the fact that future success will depend on its ability to retain employees and attract clients; there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; failure to produce projected revenues could adversely affect financial results; and there is the possibility of involvement in litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities. Because long term contracts are not a significant part of the Companys business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. Further information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates As described below, the Companys most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments. 12 Accounts Receivable Allowances. The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from (i) the inability of its customers to make required payments, (ii) temporary placement sales adjustments, and (iii) permanent placement candidates not remaining with the client through the 90 day guarantee period, commonly referred to as fall offs. The Company establishes these allowances based on its review of customers credit profiles, historical loss statistics and current trends. The adequacy of these allowances is reviewed each reporting period. Historically, the Companys actual losses and credits have been consistent with these allowances. As a percentage of gross accounts receivable, the Companys accounts receivable allowances totaled 5.6% and 6.6% as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of December 31, 2009, a five percentage point deviation in the Companys accounts receivable allowances balance would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the allowance of $1.1 million. Although future results cannot always be predicted by extrapolating past results, management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience. However, if the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur, additional allowances may be required. Income Tax Assets and Liabilities. In establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the Company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to its operations. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates, which the Company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. The likelihood of a material change in the Companys expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final U.S. and foreign tax settlements, and the effectiveness of its tax planning in the various relevant jurisdictions. The Company also evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts. Management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events, including operating results, to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of our deferred tax assets may not be realized. When appropriate, a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized. In relation to actual net operating losses in certain foreign operations, valuation allowances of $21.2 million were recorded as of December 31, 2009. If such losses are ultimately utilized to offset future operating income, the Company will benefit its deferred tax assets up to the full amount of the valuation reserve. While management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the Company. Goodwill Impairment. The Company assesses the impairment of goodwill annually in the second quarter, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) authoritative guidance. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis during the three months ended June 30, 2009, and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required. There were no events or changes in circumstances during the six months ended December 31, 2009, that caused the Company to perform an interim impairment assessment. FASB authoritative guidance requires a two step approach for determining goodwill impairment. In the first step the Company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing a present value technique derived from a discounted cash flow methodology. For purposes of this assessment the Companys reporting units are its lines of business. The fair value of the reporting unit is then compared to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed. The second step under the FASB guidance is contingent upon the results of the first step. To the extent a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting units goodwill may be impaired and the Company must perform a second more detailed impairment 13 assessment. The second impairment assessment involves allocating the reporting units fair value to its net assets in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill as of the assessment date. The implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date. The Companys reporting units are Accountemps, Robert Half Finance & Accounting, OfficeTeam, Robert Half Technology, Robert Half Management Resources and Protiviti, which had goodwill balances at December 31, 2009, of $127.5 million, $26.6 million, $0.0 million, $7.2 million, $0.0 million and $28.0 million, respectively, totaling $189.3 million. There were no changes to the Companys reporting units or to the allocations of goodwill by reporting unit through December 31, 2009. The goodwill impairment assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. The estimate of future cash flows is based upon, among other things, a discount rate and certain assumptions about expected future operating performance. The discount rate for all reporting units was determined by management based on estimates of risk free interest rates, beta and market risk premiums. The discount rate used was compared to the rate published in various third party research reports, which indicated that the rate was within a range of reasonableness. The primary assumptions related to future operating performance include revenue growth rates and profitability levels. In addition, the impairment assessment requires that management make certain judgments in allocating shared assets and liabilities to the balance sheets of the reporting units. Solely for purposes of establishing inputs for the fair value calculations described above related to its annual goodwill impairment testing, the Company made the following assumptions. The Company assumed that the current economic downturn would continue for all reporting units through 2010, followed by a recovery period in 2011 and 2012, using unique assumptions for each reporting unit. In addition, the Company applied profitability assumptions consistent with each reporting units historical trends at various revenue levels and, for years beyond 2012, used a 5% growth factor to calculate the terminal value at the end of ten years for each unit. This rate is consistent with the rate used for the Companys interim test during the first quarter of 2009, and is significantly lower than the Companys historical ten year annual compound revenue growth rate. In its most recent calculation, the Company used a 10.7% discount rate, which is slightly lower than the 10.9% discount rate used for the Companys interim test during the first quarter of 2009. This decline in discount rate is primarily due to a decline in the market risk premium partially offset by an increase in the risk free rate. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied hypothetical decreases to the fair values of each reporting unit. The Company determined that hypothetical decreases in fair value of at least 30% would be required before any reporting unit would have a carrying value in excess of its fair value. Given the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on the Companys business, there can be no assurance that the Companys estimates and assumptions regarding the duration of the ongoing economic downturn, or the period or strength of recovery, made for purposes of the Companys goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If the Companys assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or profitability growth rates of certain reporting units are not achieved, the Company may be required to recognize goodwill impairment charges in future periods. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material. Workers Compensation. Except for states which require participation in state operated insurance funds, the Company retains the economic burden for the first $0.5 million per occurrence in workers compensation claims. Workers compensation includes ongoing healthcare and indemnity coverage for claims and may be paid over numerous years following the date of injury. Claims in excess of $0.5 million are insured. Workers compensation expense includes the insurance premiums for claims in excess of $0.5 million, claims administration fees charged by the Companys workers compensation administrator, premiums paid to state operated insurance funds, and an estimate for the Companys liability for Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) 14 claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims. Total workers compensation expense was $5.0 million and $12.1 million, representing 0.23% and 0.37% of applicable U.S. revenue for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The accrual for IBNR claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims in each reporting period includes estimates. The Company has established reserves for workers compensation claims using loss development rates which are estimated using periodic third party actuarial valuations based upon historical loss statistics which include the Companys historical frequency and severity of workers compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. While management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the Companys future results. Based on the Companys results for the year ended December 31, 2009, a five percentage point deviation in the Companys estimated loss development rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the reserve of $0.1 million. Stock based Compensation. Under various stock plans, officers, employees and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock, stock units, stock appreciation rights or options to purchase common stock. Compensation expense for restricted stock and stock units is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the stocks fair market value on the grant date. For restricted stock grants issued with performance conditions, compensation expense is recognized over each vesting tranche. The Company recognizes compensation expense for only the portion of restricted stock and stock units that is expected to vest, rather than record forfeitures when they occur. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods. For purposes of calculating stock based compensation expense for retirement eligible employees, the service period is assumed to be met on the grant date or retirement eligible date, whichever is later. No stock appreciation rights have been granted under the Companys existing stock plans. The Company determines the fair value of options to purchase common stock using the Black Scholes valuation model. The Company recognizes expense over the service period for options that are expected to vest and records adjustments to compensation expense at the end of the service period if actual forfeitures differ from original estimates. The Company has not granted any options to purchase common stock since 2006. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, compensation expense related to stock options was $0.8 million, $5.1 million and $9.2 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units was $60.3 million, $63.6 million and $53.8 million, respectively, of which $12.0 million, $17.0 million and $21.1 million was related to grants made in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. A one percentage point deviation in the estimated forfeiture rates would have resulted in a $0.6 million, $0.6 million and $0.5 million increase or decrease in compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Determining Fair Value When The Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly. In April 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which highlights and expands on the factors that should be considered in estimating fair value when there has been a significant decrease in market activity for a financial asset. This authoritative guidance became effective for interim and annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of this guidance during the three months ended June 30, 2009, did not have an impact on the Companys Financial Statements. Subsequent Events. In May 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which establishes standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are 15 issued. This guidance also requires disclosure of the date through which an entity has evaluated subsequent events and the basis for this date. This authoritative guidance became effective for interim or annual periods ending after June 15, 2009. The adoption of this guidance during the three months ended June 30, 2009, did not have a material effect on the Companys Financial Statements. Accounting Standards Codification. In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification as the single source of authoritative U.S. generally accepted accounting principles recognized by the FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities. The FASB Accounting Standards Codification is effective for interim and annual periods ending after September 15, 2009. The adoption of the FASB Accounting Standards Codification during the three months ended September 30, 2009, did not have a material effect on the Companys Financial Statements. Transfers of Financial Assets. In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires entities to provide more information regarding sales of securitized financial assets and similar transactions, particularly if the seller retains some risk with respect to the assets. This authoritative guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on its Financial Statements. Variable Interest Entities. In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance designed to improve financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities and to provide more relevant and reliable information to users of financial statements. This authoritative guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on its Financial Statements. Fair Value Measurement of Liabilities. In August 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which provides clarification regarding the required techniques for the fair value measurement of liabilities. This update applies to all entities that measure liabilities at fair value, and is effective for the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after its issuance in August 2009. The adoption of this guidance during the three months ended December 31, 2009, did not have a material effect on the Companys Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services (deliverables) separately rather than as a combined unit. This guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. This guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. Furthermore, this guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendors multiple deliverable revenue arrangements. This authoritative guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on its Financial Statements. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which requires certain new disclosures and clarifies certain existing disclosure requirements about fair value measurement as set forth in the FASB Accounting Standards Codification. This authoritative guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2009. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on its Financial Statements. Results of Operations Demand for the Companys temporary and permanent staffing services and risk consulting and internal audit services is largely dependent upon general economic and labor market conditions both domestically and abroad. Correspondingly, results of operations were negatively impacted by difficult global economic conditions in the latter portion of 2008 and throughout 2009. Because of the inherent difficulty in predicting economic 16 trends and the absence of material long term contracts in any of our business units, future demand for the Companys services cannot be forecasted with certainty. We expect total Company results to continue to be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in 2010. The Companys temporary and permanent staffing services business has more than 365 offices in 42 states, the District of Columbia and 20 foreign countries, while Protiviti has more than 60 offices in 23 states and 16 foreign countries. Because fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have an impact on the Companys results, the Company provides selected growth percentages below on a constant currency basis. Constant currency percentages are calculated using as reported amounts which have been retranslated using foreign currency exchange rates from the prior years comparable period. Years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 Revenues. The Companys revenues were $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, down 34% from $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. Revenues from foreign operations represented 29% of total revenues for both the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008. The Company analyzes its revenues for three reportable segments: temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services. In 2009, revenues for all three of the Companys reportable segments were down compared to 2008. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail. Temporary and consultant staffing services revenues were $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, down 32% from revenues of $3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. On a constant currency basis, temporary and consultant staffing services revenues decreased 30% for 2009 compared to 2008. Throughout 2009, demand for the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services was significantly impacted by difficult global labor markets and weak general macroeconomic conditions. In the United States, 2009 revenues decreased 32% compared to 2008. The Companys revenues from foreign operations decreased 31% for 2009 compared to 2008. On a constant currency basis, the Companys revenues from foreign operations decreased 25% for 2009 compared to 2008. Permanent placement revenues were $182 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, down 57% from revenues of $427 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. On a constant currency basis, permanent placement revenues decreased 56% for 2009 compared to 2008. In the United States, 2009 revenues decreased 62% compared to 2008. Historically, demand for permanent placement services is even more sensitive to economic and labor market conditions than demand for temporary and consulting staffing services and this is expected to continue. The December 2009 unemployment rate in the U.S. was 10%, its highest level since 1983. The Companys revenues from foreign operations decreased 51% for 2009 compared to 2008. On a constant currency basis, the Companys revenues from foreign operations decreased 48% for 2009 compared to 2008. Risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were $384 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, down 30% from revenues of $547 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. On a constant currency basis, risk consulting and internal audit services revenues decreased 29% for 2009 compared to 2008 as weak global macroeconomic conditions negatively impacted demand. Contributing to the decrease was a decline in revenues produced by compliance related projects, mainly those tied to the Sarbanes Oxley Act, a trend which may continue. In the United States, 2009 revenues decreased 29% compared to 2008. The Companys revenues from foreign operations decreased 31% for 2009 compared to 2008. On a constant currency basis, the Companys revenues from foreign operations decreased 28% for 2009 compared to 2008. Gross Margin. The Companys gross margin dollars were $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, down 42% from $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. For 2009 compared to 2008, gross margin dollars for all three of the Companys reportable segments decreased under difficult economic conditions. 17 Gross margin dollars as a percentage of revenues also decreased for the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services and risk consulting and internal audit services divisions on a year over year basis. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail. Gross margin dollars from the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist of payroll, payroll taxes and insurance costs for temporary employees, and reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services division were $842 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, down 37% from $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. On a constant currency basis, temporary and consultant staffing services gross margin dollars decreased 35% for 2009 compared to 2008. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin dollars for temporary and consultant staffing services were 34.1% in 2009, down from 36.7% in 2008. This year over year decrease was the result of significantly lower conversion revenues and compression of pay/bill spreads in 2009 compared to 2008. Conversion revenues are earned when a temporary position converts to a permanent position. As there are no direct costs related to conversion revenues, the gross margin percentage is favorably impacted as the mix of conversion revenues increases. Pay/bill spreads represent the differential between wages paid to temporary employees and amounts billed to clients. Gross margin dollars from permanent placement staffing services represent revenues less reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for the Companys permanent placement staffing division were $182 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, down 57% from $427 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. On a constant currency basis, permanent placement gross margin dollars decreased 56% for 2009 compared to 2008. Because reimbursable expenses for permanent placement staffing services are de minimis, the decrease in gross margin dollars is substantially explained by the decrease in revenues previously discussed. Gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist primarily of professional staff payroll, payroll taxes, insurance costs and reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for the Companys risk consulting and internal audit division were $80 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, down 48% from $155 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. On a constant currency basis, risk consulting and internal audit gross margin dollars decreased 48% for 2009 compared to 2008. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services were 20.8% in 2009, down from 28.3% in 2008. The year over year margin decline is primarily due to lower staff utilization levels resulting from lower revenues as well as higher staff reduction charges. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The Companys selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of staff compensation, advertising, depreciation and occupancy costs. The Companys selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, down 31% from $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008. As a percentage of revenues, the Companys selling, general and administrative expenses were 34.1% for 2009, up from 32.5% for 2008. For 2009 compared to 2008, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased for all three of the Companys reportable segments. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased for all three of the Companys reportable segments in 2009 compared to 2008. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services division were $738 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, down 25% from $983 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses for temporary and consultant staffing services were 29.8% in 2009, up from 27.1% in 2008. For 2009 compared to 2008, increases as a percentage of revenues for administration costs, fixed overhead, variable overhead and advertising were partially offset by decreases as a percentage of revenues for field compensation and expenses related to doubtful accounts receivable. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Companys permanent placement staffing division were $189 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, down 49% from $367 million for the year ended 18 December 31, 2008. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses for permanent placement staffing services were 103.7% in 2009, up from 85.8% in 2008. For 2009 compared to 2008, increases as a percentage of revenues for fixed overhead, administration costs, variable overhead, field compensation, advertising and expenses related to doubtful accounts receivable drove the overall increase. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Companys risk consulting and internal audit services division were $111 million for the year ended December 31, 2009, down 25% from $147 million for the year ended December 31, 2008. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses for risk consulting and internal audit services were 28.9% in 2009, up from 26.9% in 2008. For 2009 compared to 2008, increases as a percentage of revenues for fixed overhead and administration costs were partially offset by decreases as a percentage of revenues for variable overhead, expenses related to doubtful accounts receivable and advertising. Operating Income. The Companys total operating income was $67 million, or 2.2% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2009, down 84% from $417 million, or 9.1% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2008. For the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services division, operating income was $105 million, or 4.2% of applicable revenues, down 70% from $349 million, or 9.6% of applicable revenues, in 2008. For the Companys permanent placement staffing division, operating loss was $7 million, or negative 3.8% of applicable revenues, down 112% from operating income of $61 million, or 14.1% of applicable revenues, in 2008. For the Companys risk consulting and internal audit services division, operating loss was $31 million, or negative 8.0% of applicable revenues, down 522% from operating income of $7 million, or 1.3% of applicable revenues, in 2008. Amortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets was $1.5 million and $2.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Intangible assets result from the Companys acquisitions. For acquisitions, the Company allocates the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net tangible assets first to identifiable intangible assets, if any, and then to goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their lives, typically ranging from two to five years. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. Net intangible assets, consisting primarily of goodwill, represented 15% of total assets and 21% of total stockholders equity at December 31, 2009. Interest income and expense. Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, was $1.9 million and $10.5 million, respectively. Lower 2009 interest income was due to lower interest rates partially offset by higher average cash balances. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, was $0.5 million and $5.3 million, respectively. Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes was 44% and 40% for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2009 increase is partially due to losses in international locations where corresponding tax benefits are not being recognized. Also contributing to the increase is the larger percentage impact that permanent non deductible tax items have on lower year over year income before taxes. Years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 Revenues. The Companys revenues were $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008, remaining flat compared to $4.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. Revenues from foreign operations represented 29% and 24% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Company analyzes its revenues for three reportable segments: temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services. In 2008, revenues in the temporary and consultant staffing services division were flat compared to 2007, while revenues in both the permanent placement and risk consulting and internal audit services divisions were down compared to 2007. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail. 19 Temporary and consultant staffing services revenues were $3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008, remaining flat compared to revenues of $3.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. On a constant currency basis, temporary and consultant staffing services revenues decreased 1% for 2008 compared to 2007. In the latter part of 2008, demand for the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services decreased significantly as global labor markets weakened along with general macroeconomic conditions. In the United States, 2008 revenues decreased 6% compared to 2007, driven primarily by an 18% decrease in the fourth quarter. The United States decrease was partially offset by the Companys revenues from foreign operations which increased 16% for 2008 compared to 2007. On a constant currency basis, the Companys revenues from foreign operations increased 14% for 2008 compared to 2007. Permanent placement revenues were $427 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, down 4% from revenues of $444 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. On a constant currency basis, permanent placement revenues decreased 5% for 2008 compared to 2007. In the United States, 2008 revenues decreased 17% compared to 2007, driven primarily by a 41% decrease in the fourth quarter. Historically, demand for permanent placement services is even more sensitive to economic and labor market conditions than demand for temporary and consulting staffing services and this is expected to continue. The December 2008 unemployment rate in the U.S. was 7.4%, its highest level since 1992. The United States decrease was partially offset by the Companys revenues from foreign operations which increased 22% for 2008 compared to 2007. On a constant currency basis, the Companys revenues from foreign operations increased 17% for 2008 compared to 2007. Risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were $547 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, down 1% from revenues of $552 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. On a constant currency basis, risk consulting and internal audit services revenues decreased 2% for 2008 compared to 2007 due to a significant decline in revenues produced by compliance related projects, mainly those tied to the Sarbanes Oxley Act, a trend which may continue. In addition, the fourth quarter weakening in global macroeconomic conditions negatively impacted demand. In the United States, 2008 revenues decreased 6% compared to 2007, including a 23% decrease in the fourth quarter. The United States decrease was partially offset by the Companys revenues from foreign operations which increased 13% for 2008 compared to 2007. On a constant currency basis, the Companys revenues from foreign operations increased 7% for 2008 compared to 2007. Gross Margin. The Companys gross margin dollars were $1.9 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008, down 3% from $2.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. For 2008 compared to 2007, gross margin dollars for all three of the Companys reportable segments decreased under difficult economic conditions. Gross margin dollars as a percentage of revenues also decreased for the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services and risk consulting and internal audit services divisions on a year over year basis. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail. Gross margin dollars from the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist of payroll, payroll taxes and insurance costs for temporary employees, and reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services division were $1.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008, down 2% from to $1.4 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007. On a constant currency basis, temporary and consultant staffing services gross margin dollars decreased 3% for 2008 compared to 2007. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin dollars for temporary and consultant staffing services were 36.7% in 2008, down from 37.2% in 2007. This year over year decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in temp to hire conversion revenues in 2008 compared to 2007. Conversion revenues are earned when a temporary position converts to a permanent position. As there are no direct costs related to conversion revenues, the gross margin percentage is favorably impacted as the mix of conversion revenues increases. Gross margin dollars from permanent placement staffing services represent revenues less reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for the Companys permanent placement staffing division were $427 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, down 4% from $444 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. On a 20 constant currency basis, permanent placement gross margin dollars decreased 5% for 2008 compared to 2007. Because reimbursable expenses for permanent placement staffing services are de minimis, the decrease in gross margin dollars is substantially explained by the decrease in revenues previously discussed. Gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist primarily of professional staff payroll, payroll taxes, insurance costs and reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for the Companys risk consulting and internal audit division were $155 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, down 11% from $175 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. On a constant currency basis, risk consulting and internal audit gross margin dollars decreased 13% for 2008 compared to 2007. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services were 28.3% in 2008, down from 31.6% in 2007. Because costs relative to revenues are generally higher in foreign operations than in the U.S., the gross margin percentage is unfavorably impacted as the mix of foreign activity increases. In 2008 risk consulting and internal audit services revenues from foreign operations increased to 30% compared to 27% in 2007, contributing most of the year over year margin decline. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The Companys selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of staff compensation, advertising, depreciation and occupancy costs. The Companys selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.5 billion for both the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. For 2008 compared to 2007, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased in the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services and risk consulting and internal audit services divisions, and increased in the Companys permanent placement staffing division. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues were essentially flat in the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services division, increased in the Companys permanent placement staffing division and decreased in the Companys internal audit and risk consulting services division, compared to 2007. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services division were $983 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, essentially flat compared to $986 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses for temporary and consultant staffing services were 27.1% in 2008, essentially flat compared to 27.0% in 2007. For 2008 compared to 2007, increases as a percentage of revenues for administration costs, fixed overhead and expenses related to doubtful accounts receivable were partially offset by decreases as a percentage of revenues for field compensation, variable overhead and advertising. As revenues declined in the latter part of 2008 under difficult economic conditions, the Company enhanced its focus on cost alignment measures, resulting in an 11% decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services division in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Companys permanent placement staffing division were $367 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, up 2% from $358 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses for permanent placement staffing services were 85.8% in 2008, up from 80.6% in 2007. For 2008 compared to 2007, increases as a percentage of revenues for field compensation, fixed overhead, administration costs, advertising and expenses related to doubtful accounts receivable were partially offset by decreases as a percentage of revenues for variable overhead. As revenues declined in the latter part of 2008 under difficult economic conditions, the Company enhanced its focus on cost alignment measures, resulting in a 24% decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Companys permanent placement staffing division in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Companys risk consulting and internal audit services division were $147 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, down 4% from $154 million for the year ended December 31, 2007. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses for risk consulting and internal audit services were 26.9% in 2008, down from 27.8% in 2007. For 2008 compared to 21 2007, decreases as a percentage of revenues for variable overhead and advertising were partially offset by increases as a percentage of revenues for fixed overhead and expenses related to doubtful accounts receivable. As revenues declined in the latter part of 2008 under difficult economic conditions, the Company enhanced its focus on cost alignment measures, resulting in a 17% decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses in the Companys risk consulting and internal audit division in the fourth quarter of 2008 compared to the fourth quarter of 2007. Operating Income. The Companys total operating income was $417 million, or 9.1% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2008, down 13% from $480 million, or 10.3% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2007. For the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services division, operating income was $349 million, or 9.6% of applicable revenues, down 6% from $373 million, or 10.2% of applicable revenues, in 2007. For the Companys permanent placement staffing division, operating income was $61 million, or 14.1% of applicable revenues, down 30% from $86 million, or 19.4% of applicable revenues, in 2007. For the Companys risk consulting and internal audit services division, operating income was $7 million or 1.3% of applicable revenues, down 65% from $21 million, or 3.8% of applicable revenues, in 2007. Amortization of intangible assets. Amortization of intangible assets was $2.6 million for both the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Intangible assets result from the Companys acquisitions. For acquisitions, the Company allocates the excess of cost over the fair market value of the net tangible assets first to identifiable intangible assets, if any, and then to goodwill. Identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their lives, typically ranging from two to five years. Goodwill is not amortized, but is tested at least annually for impairment. Net intangible assets, consisting primarily of goodwill, represented 13% of total assets and 19% of total stockholders equity at December 31, 2008. Interest income and expense. Interest income for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, was $10.5 million and $17.2 million, respectively. Lower 2008 interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates. Interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007, was $5.3 million and $4.1 million, respectively. Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes was 40% for both the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007. Liquidity and Capital Resources The change in the Companys liquidity during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, is primarily the net effect of funds generated by operations and the funds used for capital expenditures, repurchases of common stock and payment of dividends. Cash and cash equivalents were $366 million, $355 million and $310 million at December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. Operating activities provided $240 million during the year ended December 31, 2009, partially offset by $46 million and $192 million of net cash used in investing activities and financing activities, respectively. Operating activities provided $447 million during the year ended December 31, 2008, partially offset by $95 million and $285 million of net cash used in investing activities and financing activities, respectively. Operating activities provided $411 million during the year ended December 31, 2007, offset by $116 million and $452 million of net cash used in investing activities and financing activities, respectively.

This was composed of capital expenditures of $84 million, purchases of goodwill and other intangible assets of $19 million, and deposits to trusts for employee benefits and retirement plans of $13 million. Financing activities Cash used in financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2009, was $192 million.

As of December 31, 2009, the Company is authorized to repurchase, from time to time, up to 5.1 million additional shares of the Companys common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions, depending on market conditions. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, the Company repurchased approximately 4.7 million shares, 9.4 million shares and 12.2 million shares of common stock on the open market for a total cost of $110 million, $203 million and $397 million, respectively. Additional stock repurchases were made in connection with employee stock plans, whereby Company shares were tendered by employees for the payment of exercise price and applicable statutory withholding taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007, such repurchases totaled approximately 1.7 million shares, 1.6 million shares and 1.6 million shares at a cost of $40 million, $42 million and $58 million, respectively. Repurchases of shares have been funded with cash generated from operations. The Companys working capital at December 31, 2009, included $366 million in cash and cash equivalents. The Companys working capital requirements relate primarily to accounts receivable. While there can be no assurances in this regard, the Company expects that internally generated cash will be sufficient to support the working capital needs of the Company, the Companys fixed payments, dividends, and other obligations on both a short and long term basis. On February 10, 2010, the Company announced a quarterly dividend of $.13 per share to be paid to all shareholders of record on February 25, 2010. The dividend will be paid on March 15, 2010. The Companys cash flows generated from operations are also the primary source for funding various contractual obligations. The table below summarizes the Companys major commitments as of December 31, 2009 (in thousands): Payments due by period Contractual Obligations 2010 2011 and 2012 2013 and 2014 Thereafter Total Long term debt obligations $ 277 $ 534 $ 505 $ 1,766 $ 3,082 Operating lease obligations 108,274 148,834 76,419 114,298 447,825 Purchase obligations 18,627 2,035 4 20,666 Other liabilities 1,320 1,998 1,515 8,645 13,478 Total $ 128,498 $ 153,401 $ 78,443 $ 124,709 $ 485,051 23 Long term debt obligations consist of promissory notes and related interest as well as other forms of indebtedness issued in connection with certain acquisitions and other payment obligations.

Purchase obligations consist of purchase commitments primarily related to telecom service agreements, software licenses and subscriptions, and computer hardware and software maintenance agreements. The above table does not reflect $13.1 million of unrecognized tax benefits which the Company has accrued for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FASB authoritative guidance. As of December 31, 2009, the Company classified $11.1 million of its unrecognized tax benefits as a current liability, as these amounts are expected to be resolved in the next twelve months. The remaining $2.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits have been classified as a non current liability, as a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of future payments, if any, could not be determined. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The Companys exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the Companys foreign subsidiaries. Exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar value of the Companys reported earnings, investments in its foreign subsidiaries, and the intercompany transactions with its foreign subsidiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2009, approximately 29% of the Companys revenues were generated outside of the United States. These operations transact business in their functional currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar have an impact on the Companys reported results. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Consequently, as the value of the U.S. dollar changes relative to the currencies of the Companys non U.S. markets, the Companys reported results vary. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar amount of the Companys stockholders equity. The assets and liabilities of the Companys non U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. 24
