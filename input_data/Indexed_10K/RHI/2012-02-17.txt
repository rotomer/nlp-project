Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Certain information contained in Managements Discussion and Analysis and in other parts of this report may be deemed forward looking statements regarding events and financial trends that may affect the Companys future operating results or financial positions. These statements may be identified by words such as estimate, forecast, project, plan, intend, believe, expect, anticipate, or variations or negatives thereof or by similar or comparable words or phrases. Forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in the statements. These risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the following: the global financial and economic situation; changes in levels of unemployment and other economic conditions in the United States or foreign countries where the Company does business, or in particular regions or industries; reduction in the supply of candidates for temporary employment or the Companys ability to attract candidates; the entry of new competitors into the marketplace or expansion by existing competitors; the ability of the Company to maintain existing client relationships and attract new clients in the context of changing economic or competitive conditions; the impact of competitive pressures, including any change in the demand for the Companys services, on the Companys ability to maintain its margins; the possibility of the Company incurring liability for its activities, including the activities of its temporary employees, or for events impacting its temporary employees on clients premises; the possibility that adverse publicity could impact the Companys ability to attract and retain clients and candidates; the success of the Company in attracting, training, and retaining qualified management personnel and other staff employees; the Companys ability to comply with governmental regulations affecting personnel services businesses in particular or employer/employee relationships in general; whether there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; the Companys reliance on short term contracts for a significant percentage of its business; litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities, including litigation that may be disclosed from time to time in the Companys SEC filings; the ability of the Company to manage its international operations and comply with foreign laws and regulations; the impact of fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates; the possibility that the additional costs the Company will incur as a result of health care reform legislation may have a material adverse effect on the Companys profit margins or the demand for the Companys services; the possibility that the additional costs the Company will incur as a result of other government legislation or regulations may have a material adverse effect on the Companys profit margins or the demand for the Companys services; the possibility that the Companys computer and communications hardware and software systems could be damaged or their service interrupted; and the possibility that the Company may fail to maintain adequate financial and management controls and as a result suffer errors in its financial reporting. Additionally, with respect to Protiviti, other risks and uncertainties include the fact that future success will depend on its ability to retain employees and attract clients; there can be no assurance that there will be ongoing demand for Sarbanes Oxley or other regulatory compliance services; failure to produce projected revenues could adversely affect financial results; and there is the possibility of involvement in litigation relating to prior or current transactions or activities. Because long term contracts are not a significant part of the Companys business, future results cannot be reliably predicted by considering past trends or extrapolating past results. Further information regarding these and other risks and uncertainties is contained in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates As described below, the Companys most critical accounting policies and estimates are those that involve subjective decisions or assessments. Accounts Receivable Allowances. The Company maintains allowances for estimated losses resulting from (i) the inability of its customers to make required payments, (ii) temporary placement sales adjustments, and (iii) permanent placement candidates not remaining with the client through the 90 day guarantee period, commonly referred to as fall offs. The Company establishes these allowances based on its review of customers credit profiles, historical loss statistics and current trends. The adequacy of these allowances is reviewed each reporting period. Historically, the Companys actual losses and credits have been consistent with these allowances. As a percentage of gross accounts receivable, the Companys accounts receivable allowances totaled 4.4% and 4.8% as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, a five 13 percentage point deviation in the Companys accounts receivable allowances balance would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the allowance of $1.1 million. Although future results cannot always be predicted by extrapolating past results, management believes that it is reasonably likely that future results will be consistent with historical trends and experience. However, if the financial condition of the Companys customers were to deteriorate, resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, or if unexpected events or significant future changes in trends were to occur, additional allowances may be required. Income Tax Assets and Liabilities. In establishing its deferred income tax assets and liabilities, the Company makes judgments and interpretations based on the enacted tax laws and published tax guidance that are applicable to its operations. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured and recorded using current enacted tax rates, which the Company expects will apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are recovered or settled. The likelihood of a material change in the Companys expected realization of these assets is dependent on future taxable income, its ability to use foreign tax credit carryforwards and carrybacks, final U.S. and foreign tax settlements, and the effectiveness of its tax planning in the various relevant jurisdictions. The Company also evaluates the need for valuation allowances to reduce the deferred tax assets to realizable amounts. Management evaluates all positive and negative evidence and uses judgment regarding past and future events, including operating results, to help determine when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets may not be realized. When appropriate, a valuation allowance is recorded against deferred tax assets to offset future tax benefits that may not be realized. Valuation allowances of $36.3 million and $31.0 million were recorded as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The valuation allowances recorded related primarily to net operating losses in certain foreign operations. If such losses are ultimately utilized to offset future operating income, the Company will recognize a tax benefit up to the full amount of the valuation reserve. While management believes that its judgments and interpretations regarding income taxes are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience may materially affect the future financial results of the Company. Goodwill Impairment. The Company assesses the impairment of goodwill annually in the second quarter, or more often if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) authoritative guidance. The Company completed its annual goodwill impairment analysis as of June 30, 2011, and determined that no adjustment to the carrying value of goodwill was required. There were no events or changes in circumstances during the six months ended December 31, 2011 that caused the Company to perform an interim impairment assessment. FASB authoritative guidance requires a two step approach for determining goodwill impairment. In the first step the Company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing a present value technique derived from a discounted cash flow methodology. For purposes of this assessment the Companys reporting units are its lines of business. The fair value of the reporting unit is then compared to its carrying value. If the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value of the net assets assigned to that unit, goodwill is not impaired and no further testing is performed. The second step under the FASB guidance is contingent upon the results of the first step. To the extent a reporting units carrying value exceeds its fair value, an indication exists that the reporting units goodwill may be impaired and the Company must perform a second more detailed impairment assessment. The second step involves allocating the reporting units fair value to its net assets in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill as of the assessment date. The implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date. The Companys reporting units are Accountemps, Robert Half Finance & Accounting, OfficeTeam, Robert Half Technology, Robert Half Management Resources and Protiviti, which had goodwill balances at December 31, 2011, of $127.4 million, $26.5 million, $0.0 million, $7.2 million, $0.0 million and $28.3 million, 14 respectively, totaling $189.4 million. There were no changes to the Companys reporting units or to the allocations of goodwill by reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2011. The goodwill impairment assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis. The estimate of future cash flows is based upon, among other things, a discount rate and certain assumptions about expected future operating performance. The discount rate for all reporting units was determined by management based on estimates of risk free interest rates, beta and market risk premiums. The discount rate used was compared to the rate published in various third party research reports, which indicated that the rate was within a range of reasonableness. The primary assumptions related to future operating performance include revenue growth rates and profitability levels. In addition, the impairment assessment requires that management make certain judgments in allocating shared assets and liabilities to the balance sheets of the reporting units. Solely for purposes of establishing inputs for the fair value calculations described above related to its annual goodwill impairment testing, the Company made the following assumptions. The Company assumed that year to date trends through the date of the last assessment would continue for all reporting units through 2011, using unique assumptions for each reporting unit. In addition, the Company applied profitability assumptions consistent with each reporting units historical trends at various revenue levels and, for years 2013 and beyond, used a 5% growth factor to calculate the terminal value at the end of ten years for each unit. This rate is comparable to the Companys most recent ten year annual compound revenue growth rate. In its most recent calculation, the Company used a 9.5% discount rate, which is slightly lower than the 9.6% discount rate used for the Companys test during the second quarter of 2010. In order to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value calculations on the goodwill impairment test, the Company applied hypothetical decreases to the fair values of each reporting unit. The Company determined that hypothetical decreases in fair value of at least 70% would be required before any reporting unit would have a carrying value in excess of its fair value. Given the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on the Companys business, there can be no assurance that the Companys estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the Companys goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future. If the Companys assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or profitability growth rates of certain reporting units are not achieved, the Company may be required to recognize goodwill impairment charges in future periods. It is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or, if it does, whether such charge would be material. Workers Compensation. Except for states which require participation in state operated insurance funds, the Company retains the economic burden for the first $0.5 million per occurrence in workers compensation claims. Workers compensation includes ongoing healthcare and indemnity coverage for claims and may be paid over numerous years following the date of injury. Claims in excess of $0.5 million are insured. Workers compensation expense includes the insurance premiums for claims in excess of $0.5 million, claims administration fees charged by the Companys workers compensation administrator, premiums paid to state operated insurance funds, and an estimate for the Companys liability for Incurred But Not Reported (IBNR) claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims. Total workers compensation expense was $7.9 million, $6.6 million and $5.0 million, representing 0.30%, 0.29% and 0.23% of applicable U.S. revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The reserves for IBNR claims and for the ongoing development of existing claims in each reporting period includes estimates. The Company has established reserves for workers compensation claims using loss development rates which are estimated using periodic third party actuarial valuations based upon historical loss statistics which include the Companys historical frequency and severity of workers compensation claims, and an estimate of future cost trends. While management believes that its assumptions and estimates are appropriate, significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in assumptions may materially affect the Companys future results. Based on the Companys results for the year ended December 31, 2011, a five 15 percentage point deviation in the Companys estimated loss development rates would have resulted in an increase or decrease in the reserve of $0.3 million. Stock based Compensation. Under various stock plans, officers, employees and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock, stock units, stock appreciation rights or options to purchase common stock. Compensation expense for restricted stock and stock units is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the stocks fair market value on the grant date. For restricted stock grants issued with performance conditions, compensation expense is recognized over each vesting tranche. The Company recognizes compensation expense for only the portion of restricted stock and stock units that is expected to vest, rather than record forfeitures when they occur. If the actual number of forfeitures differs from those estimated by management, additional adjustments to compensation expense may be required in future periods. For purposes of calculating stock based compensation expense for retirement eligible employees, the service period is assumed to be met on the grant date or retirement eligible date, whichever is later. No stock appreciation rights have been granted under the Companys existing stock plans. The Company determines the fair value of options to purchase common stock using the Black Scholes valuation model. The Company recognizes expense over the service period for options that are expected to vest and records adjustments to compensation expense at the end of the service period if actual forfeitures differ from original estimates. The Company has not granted any options to purchase common stock since 2006. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, compensation expense related to stock options was $0.0 million, $0.2 million and $0.8 million, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units was $50.9 million, $56.9 million and $60.3 million, respectively, of which $13.3 million, $12.2 million and $12.0 million was related to grants made in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. A one percentage point deviation in the estimated forfeiture rates would have resulted in a $0.5 million, $0.6 million and $0.6 million increase or decrease in compensation expense related to restricted stock and stock units for each year ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Recent Accounting Pronouncements Balance Sheet Disclosures. In December 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance in regards to the presentation of netting assets and liabilities as a single amount in the statement of financial position to address the difference between GAAP and international financial reporting standards (IFRS). This authoritative guidance is to be applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2013, and interim periods within those annual periods. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on its Financial Statements. Testing Goodwill for Impairment. In August 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which is intended to simplify how entities test goodwill for impairment by permitting an entity to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the two step goodwill impairment test. This authoritative guidance is to be applied prospectively and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on its Financial Statements. Comprehensive Income. In June 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which allows an entity the option to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income, and the components of other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This authoritative guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income as part of the statement of changes in stockholders equity. This authoritative guidance is 16 to be applied retrospectively and is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within those years, beginning after December 15, 2011. Except for presentation requirements, the Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on its Financial Statements. In December 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to defer only those changes related to the presentation of reclassification adjustments. The amendments are being made to allow the FASB time to reconsider whether to present on the face of the financial statements the effects of reclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income on the components of net income and other comprehensive income for all periods presented. This authoritative guidance is to be applied prospectively and is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on its Financial Statements. Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures. In May 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in GAAP and IFRS. The amendments explain how to measure fair value and will improve the comparability of fair value measurement presented and disclosed in financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP and IFRS. This authoritative guidance is to be applied prospectively and is effective during interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2011. The Company does not expect the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on its Financial Statements. Business Combinations. In December 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which specifies that if a public entity presents comparative financial statements, the entity should disclose revenue and earnings of the combined entity as though the business combinations that occurred during the current year had occurred as of the beginning of the comparable prior annual reporting period only. Furthermore, this guidance expands the supplemental pro forma disclosure requirement. This authoritative guidance was effective prospectively for business combinations with an acquisition date on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after December 15, 2010. The adoption of this guidance during the three months ended March 31, 2011, did not have an impact on the Companys Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements. In October 2009, the FASB issued authoritative guidance which addresses the accounting for multiple deliverable arrangements to enable vendors to account for products or services (deliverables) separately rather than as a combined unit. This guidance establishes a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. This guidance also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method. Furthermore, this guidance significantly expands required disclosures related to a vendors multiple deliverable revenue arrangements. This authoritative guidance was effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2010. The adoption of this guidance during the three months ended March 31, 2011, did not have an impact on the Companys Financial Statements. Results of Operations Demand for the Companys temporary and permanent staffing services and risk consulting and internal audit services is largely dependent upon general economic and labor market conditions both domestically and abroad. Correspondingly, results of operations were positively impacted by improving global economic conditions during 2011. Because of the inherent difficulty in predicting economic trends and the absence of material long term contracts in any of our business units, future demand for the Companys services cannot be forecasted with certainty. We expect total Company results to continue to be impacted by general macroeconomic conditions in 2012. The Companys temporary and permanent staffing services business has more than 350 offices in 42 states, the District of Columbia and 19 foreign countries, while Protiviti has 60 offices in 23 states and 13 foreign countries. 17 Because fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates have an impact on the Companys results, the Company provides selected growth percentages below on a constant currency basis. Constant currency percentages are calculated using as reported amounts which have been retranslated using foreign currency exchange rates from the prior years comparable period. Years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 Revenues. The Companys revenues were $3.8 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, up 19% from $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. Revenues from foreign operations represented 30% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to 29% of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2010. The Company analyzes its revenues for three reportable segments: temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services. In 2011, revenues for all three of the Companys reportable segments increased compared to 2010. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail. Temporary and consultant staffing services revenues were $3.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, up 19% from revenues of $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. On a constant currency basis, temporary and consultant staffing services revenues increased 17% for 2011 compared to 2010. In the United States, 2011 revenues increased 17% compared to 2010. Although unemployment rates in the United States remained high for the year ended December 31, 2011, the Company experienced an increase in demand for its temporary and consulting services during the year. This is consistent with prior post recession periods where we believe clients seek to keep their labor costs as variable as possible. The Companys revenues from foreign operations increased 25% for 2011 compared to 2010. On a constant currency basis, the Companys revenues from foreign operations increased 18% for 2011 compared to 2010. Permanent placement revenues were $302 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, up 37% from revenues of $221 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. On a constant currency basis, permanent placement revenues increased 33% for 2011 compared to 2010. In the United States, 2011 revenues increased 42% compared to 2010. Although unemployment rates in the United States remained high throughout 2011, the Company experienced an increase in demand for its permanent placement services during this period. The Company believes this demand was bolstered by clients who had previously made deep personnel cuts and needed to reinstate a portion of their workforce as business conditions improved. The Companys revenues from foreign operations increased 31% for 2011 compared to 2010. On a constant currency basis, the Companys revenues from foreign operations increased 25% for 2011 compared to 2010. Risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were $424 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, up 10% from revenues of $386 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. On a constant currency basis, risk consulting and internal audit services revenues increased 8% for 2011 compared to 2010. In the United States, 2011 revenues increased 12% compared to 2010. The Companys revenues from foreign operations increased 4% for 2011 compared to 2010. On a constant currency basis, the Companys revenues from foreign operations decreased 1% for 2011 compared to 2010. Gross Margin. The Companys gross margin dollars were $1.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, up 25% from $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. For 2011 compared to 2010, gross margin dollars for all three of the Companys reportable segments increased. Gross margin dollars as a percentage of revenues increased for the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services and risk consulting and internal audit services segments on a year over year basis. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail. Gross margin dollars from the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist of payroll, payroll taxes and insurance costs for temporary employees, and reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services division were $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, up 23% from $876 million for the year ended 18 December 31, 2010. On a constant currency basis, temporary and consultant staffing services gross margin dollars increased 21% for 2011 compared to 2010. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin dollars for temporary and consultant staffing services were 35.2% for 2011, up from 34.1% in 2010. Gross margin dollars from permanent placement staffing services represent revenues less reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for the Companys permanent placement staffing division were $302 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, up 37% from $221 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. On a constant currency basis, permanent placement gross margin dollars increased 33% for 2011 compared to 2010. Because reimbursable expenses for permanent placement staffing services are de minimis, the increase in gross margin dollars is substantially explained by the increase in revenues previously discussed. Gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services represent revenues less direct costs of services, which consist primarily of professional staff payroll, payroll taxes, insurance costs and reimbursable expenses. Gross margin dollars for the Companys risk consulting and internal audit division were $114 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, up 17% from $97 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. On a constant currency basis, risk consulting and internal audit gross margin dollars increased 16% for 2011 compared to 2010. As a percentage of revenues, gross margin dollars for risk consulting and internal audit services were 26.8% in 2011, up from 25.2% in 2010. The year over year margin increase is primarily due to higher staff utilization levels. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. The Companys selling, general and administrative expenses consist primarily of staff compensation, advertising, depreciation and occupancy costs. The Companys selling, general and administrative expenses were $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2011, up 15% from $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010. As a percentage of revenues, the Companys selling, general and administrative expenses were 32.8% for 2011, down from 34.0% for 2010. For 2011 compared to 2010, selling, general and administrative expenses for all three of the Companys reportable segments increased. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased for all three of the Companys reportable segments in 2011 compared to 2010. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services division were $865 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, up 13% from $767 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses for temporary and consultant staffing services were 28.3% in 2011, down from 29.9% in 2010. For 2011 compared to 2010, improved leverage in selling, general and administrative expenses drove the overall decrease as a percentage of revenues. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Companys permanent placement staffing division were $267 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, up 31% from $204 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses for permanent placement staffing services were 88.2% in 2011, down from 92.0% in 2010. For 2011 compared to 2010, the decreases as a percentage of revenues for variable and fixed overhead were partially offset by increases as a percentage of revenues for field compensation. Selling, general and administrative expenses for the Companys risk consulting and internal audit services division were $109 million for the year ended December 31, 2011, up slightly from $108 million for the year ended December 31, 2010. As a percentage of revenues, selling, general and administrative expenses for risk consulting and internal audit services were 25.6% in 2011, down from 28.1% in 2010. For 2011 compared to 2010, improved leverage in selling, general and administrative expenses drove the overall decrease as a percentage of revenues. Operating Income. The Companys total operating income was $249 million, or 6.6% of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2011, up 117% from $115 million, or 3.6% of revenues, for the year ended 19 December 31, 2010. For the Companys temporary and consultant staffing services division, operating income was $209 million, or 6.9% of applicable revenues, up 93% from $108 million, or 4.2% of applicable revenues, in 2010. For the Companys permanent placement staffing division, operating income was $35 million, or 11.7% of applicable revenues, up 102% from operating income of $18 million, or 7.9% of applicable revenues, in 2010. For the Companys risk consulting and internal audit services division, operating income was $5 million, or 1.2% of applicable revenues, up 145% from operating loss of $11 million, or negative 2.8% of applicable revenues, in 2010. Provision for income taxes. The provision for income taxes was 40% and 43% for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The 2011 decrease is due to proportionately lower foreign taxes on overall higher earnings and the diminishing impact of permanent non deductible tax items, which became increasingly less significant relative to the Companys improved financial results. Years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 Revenues. The Companys revenues were $3.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, up 5% from $3.0 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. Revenues from foreign operations represented 29% of total revenues for both the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009. The Company analyzes its revenues for three reportable segments: temporary and consultant staffing, permanent placement staffing and risk consulting and internal audit services. In 2010, revenues for all three of the Companys reportable segments were up compared to 2009. Contributing factors for each reportable segment are discussed below in further detail. Temporary and consultant staffing services revenues were $2.6 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, up 4% from revenues of $2.5 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. On a constant currency basis, temporary and consultant staffing services revenues increased 3% for 2010 compared to 2009. In the United States, 2010 revenues increased 4% compared to 2009. Although unemployment rates in the United States remained high for the year ended December 31, 2010, the Company experienced an increase in demand for its temporary and consulting services during the year. This is consistent with prior post recession periods where we believe clients seek to keep their labor costs as variable as possible. The Companys revenues from foreign operations increased 4% for 2010 compared to 2009. On a constant currency basis, the Companys revenues from foreign operations increased 2% for 2010 compared to 2009. Permanent placement revenues were $221 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, up 22% from revenues of $182 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. On a constant currency basis, permanent placement revenues increased 19% for 2010 compared to 2009. In the United States, 2010 revenues increased 22% compared to 2009. Although unemployment rates in the United States remained high throughout 2010, the Company experienced an increase in demand for its permanent placement services during this period. The Company believes this demand was bolstered by clients who had previously made deep personnel cuts and needed to reinstate a portion of their workforce at the first sign of improving business conditions. The Companys revenues from foreign operations increased 22% for 2010 compared to 2009. On a constant currency basis, the Companys revenues from foreign operations increased 17% for 2010 compared to 2009. Risk consulting and internal audit services revenues were $386 million for the year ended December 31, 2010, up 1% from revenues of $384 million for the year ended December 31, 2009. On a constant currency basis, risk consulting and internal audit services revenues remained flat for 2010 compared to 2009. In the United States, 2010 revenues increased 3% compared to 2009. The Companys revenues from foreign operations decreased 5% for 2010 compared to 2009. On a constant currency basis, the Companys revenues from foreign operations decreased 7% for 2010 compared to 2009. Gross Margin. The Companys gross margin dollars were $1.2 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, up 8% from $1.1 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009. For 2010 compared to 2009, gross margin dollars for all three of the Companys reportable segments increased.

Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Company is exposed to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations. The Companys exposure to foreign currency exchange rates relates primarily to the Companys foreign subsidiaries. Exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar value of the Companys reported earnings, investments in its foreign subsidiaries, and the intercompany transactions with its foreign subsidiaries. For the year ended December 31, 2011, approximately 30% of the Companys revenues were generated outside of the United States. These operations transact business in their functional currency. As a result, fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies against the U.S. dollar have an impact on the Companys reported results. Revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into U.S. dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period. Consequently, as the value of the U.S. dollar changes relative to the currencies of the Companys non U.S. markets, the Companys reported results vary. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates impact the U.S. dollar amount of the Companys stockholders equity. The assets and liabilities of the Companys non U.S. subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at period end. The resulting translation adjustments are recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. 24
