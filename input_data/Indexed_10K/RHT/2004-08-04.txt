OVERVIEW We are the global leader in providing an enterprise operating system and related systems management services based on open source technology for the information technology infrastructure requirements of large enterprises. Open source software is an alternative to proprietary software. There are no licensing fees associated with open source software. Therefore, we do not recognize any separate distinguishable value from the sale of the code itself. We derive the value from the sale of our open source solutions by the value we add through the integration and testing of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, guarantee of the levels of performance of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and rapid innovation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux in a method that allows this innovation to be consumed by our customers. In addition, we provide certain managed services for each of our technologies through Red Hat Network, a standard component of our subscriptions. We sell our technology through subscriptions to Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) and we recognize our technology based revenue over the period of the technology subscription agreements with our customers. Our products and services are offered primarily to large enterprises, government organizations, and small and medium size businesses. As further discussed in NOTE 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, we have restated our previously issued consolidated balance sheets as of February 29, 2004 and February 28, 2003 and the statements of operations, of stockholders equity and of cash flows for the three fiscal years in the period ended February 29, 2004. References herein to such financial statements are to the restated amounts. During the fiscal year ended February 28, 2002, we restructured our organization to sharpen our focus on Linux migration opportunities and to increase the amount of revenue that we generate from our Enterprise technologies. The restructuring included significant charges and the discontinuing of our network consulting business that was completed in February 2002. We have focused on introducing and gaining acceptance for our Enterprise technologies, Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS, ES and WS and Red Hat Network for the past two fiscal years. In May 2002, we introduced our initial Red Hat Enterprise Linux offering, Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS, formerly called Advanced Server. Since its initial introduction, Red Hat Enterprise Linux has gained widespread ISV and IHV support. We have continued to focus on our enterprise line of technologies by expanding our enterprise operating platform offerings and introducing new systems management services. As discussed in our critical accounting policies below, these new offerings typically have twelve month revenue recognition periods which match the subscription periods. For the fiscal year ended February 29, 2004, we sold approximately 169,500 subscriptions to our RHEL products compared to 36,500 in the previous year. This increase resulted from the increasing level of adoption of Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS as a primary operating system by larger enterprise customers and the introduction of two additional Red Hat Enterprise Linux offerings in March 2003, Red Hat Enterprise Linux ES and Red Hat Enterprise Linux WS. These two additional products are targeted at the lower end of the server market and the technical/developer workstation market and have less features and more limited service level agreements. We believe that our ability to continue to increase adoption rates of all three of our Red Hat Enterprise Linux products and maintain competitive pricing are critical to our success. 15 Table of Contents We derive our revenues and generate cash from customers from two sources: (i) subscription revenue, which includes retail, enterprise subscriptions, and embedded subscription revenue, and (ii) services revenue which includes enterprise services and embedded services described under Critical Accounting Policies below. For fiscal 2004 and 2003, our total revenues were $124.7 million and $90.3 million, respectively. The arrangements with our customers that create Enterprise subscription revenues are explained in detail under Critical Accounting Policies below and in NOTE 2 Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. These agreements typically involve the sale of subscriptions to Red Hat Enterprise Linux and in certain cases will include the sales of subscriptions to other Red Hat subscription offerings or Red Hat services. Our revenues are also affected by corporate, government and consumer spending levels. In evaluating the performance of our business, we consider a number of factors. These factors include total revenues, operating income and cash flows on a geographic basis. In addition, we also consider the following factors in our evaluation process: Subscription volumes. Our RHEL products, AS, ES and WS, are sold under subscription agreements. These agreements typically have a one year subscription period. The base subscription entitles the end user to one year of maintenance, which entitles the end user to configuration support and updates and upgrades to the technology, when and if available, during the term of the subscription. Our customers have the ability to purchase higher levels of subscriptions that increase the level of support the customer is entitled to receive. Subscription volumes increased each quarter during fiscal 2004 and are being driven primarily by the market acceptance of using the Linux operating system in enterprise data centers and our expansion of sales channels during the year. Sales by geography. We operate our business in three geographic regions; North America (U.S. and Canada); EMEA (Europe, Middle East and Africa); and Asia Pacific (Japan, Australia, Korea and China). In fiscal 2004, $39.0 million or 31% of our revenue was generated outside North America compared to $27.1 million or 30% in fiscal 2003. The percentage of our revenues generated from our international operations is expected to increase as our international sales force and channels become more mature and as we enter new locations or expand our presence in existing locations. The increase in our international revenues reflects the increasing adoption of the Linux operating system in both Europe and Japan. As noted in the Segment Reporting section of NOTE 2 in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements, our revenue in both EMEA and Asia Pacific increased at higher percentages than in North America. In the past 12 months, we have entered new markets such as China, Belgium, Netherlands, and Eastern Europe and we expect our expansion to continue to be greater in these markets. Deferred revenue balances. Our deferred revenue balance at February 29, 2004 was $73.7 million. Because of our subscription model and revenue recognition policies, deferred revenues improve predictability of future revenues. Deferred revenues at February 29, 2004, have increased by more than 282% as compared to February 28, 2003. Cash, cash equivalents and investments in debt securities. Cash, cash equivalents and investments in debt securities balances at February 29, 2004 totaled $941.4 million. During fiscal 2004, we generated $61.6 million in cash flow from operations primarily related to the increase in sales of subscriptions to Red Hat Enterprise Linux during the fiscal year. We also had positive cash flow provided by financing activities during the fiscal year of $597.3 million. This primarily relates to the issuance of senior convertible debt in January 2004 which resulted in net proceeds of $584.7 million to us. Our significant cash balance gives us the ability to take advantage of acquisition opportunities and increase investment in international opportunities. In fiscal 2005, we are focused on, among other things, (i) continuing to build on the global market momentum behind the adoption of Linux as an operating system by enterprise customers; (ii) continue our market penetration through channel partners; (iii) drive high renewal rates of subscriptions sold in prior periods and (iv) increase the contribution to our subscription sales by Intel hardware vendors. 16 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our critical accounting policies include the following: Revenue Recognition; and Impairment of Long Lived Assets Revenue Recognition We recognize revenue in accordance with Statement of Position No. 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition (SOP 97 2), as amended by SOP 98 4 and SOP 98 9, and Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 (SAB 101), as amended by Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104. Revenue recognition in accordance with these pronouncements can be complex due to the nature and variability of sales transactions. We establish persuasive evidence of an arrangement for each type of revenue based on either a signed contract with the end customer, a click through contract on our website, whereby the customer agrees to our standard subscription terms, signed distribution contracts with OEMs and resellers, or, in the case of individual training seats, through receipt of payment which indicates acceptance of our training agreement terms. Subscription Revenue Subscription revenue is comprised of enterprise, retail and embedded revenues. An account receivable and deferred revenue are recorded at the time a customer enters a binding agreement for the purchase of a subscription and subscription services are made available to the customer. Enterprise subscription revenue is comprised primarily of revenue from sales of Red Hat Enterprise Linux technology solutions, however we also generate enterprise subscription revenue from sales of Red Hat Linux, software development tools, technical support and maintenance fees. During fiscal 2003, we released the first versions of our RHEL offerings, Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS, ES and WS. These technologies are sold under a subscription agreement with specified renewal rates. Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) products generally have either one or three year base subscription periods. The base subscription entitles the end user to the technology itself and post customer support services (PCS) consisting of security errata, updates to the technology and upgrades to new versions of RHEL on a when and if available basis during the term of the subscription. We sell Red Hat Enterprise Linux through four channels: distribution, direct sales, original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and the Internet. We recognize the revenue from the sale of our RHEL offerings ratably over the period of the subscription beginning on the commencement date of the subscription agreement. We do not sell the RHEL technology or the components of the PCS that are included in the subscription on a stand alone basis. Subscription relationships with large enterprise customers often have contracts with multiple elements (e.g., software technology, maintenance and other services). We allocate revenue to each component of the contract based on objective evidence of its fair value. The fair value of the RHEL component of multiple element arrangements is supported by specific annual renewal rates in the individual customers contracts and significant evidence that our customers regularly renew their subscriptions to RHEL at the rates stated in the subscription agreement upon expiration of the original subscription term. The fair value of other service elements in multiple element arrangements is created by either (i) providing the customer with the ability during the term of the arrangement to purchase additional services at the same rate paid for the services included in the initial agreement or (ii) regularly selling our services on a stand alone basis at rates that are substantially similar to those provided in the multiple element arrangement, or both. The services offered by us as part of these multiple element arrangements also meet all of the requirements set forth in SOP 97 2 to allow for these services to be accounted for separately. Enterprise subscription revenue also includes revenue from a few large Unix to Linux migration arrangements, which were sold prior to the release of RHEL in May 2002. Revenue from these pre RHEL arrangements has generally been recognized ratably over the term of the arrangement as no pattern of performance is sufficiently discernible to allow for other than ratable recognition. The predominant portion of these pre RHEL Enterprise Linux arrangements reached maturity during the second quarter of fiscal 2004. Upon maturity, many of these customers have purchased subscriptions to RHEL. 17 Table of Contents In addition, our enterprise subscription revenue is partially derived from sales of our Red Hat Network offerings. Red Hat Network is an internet based set of services to assure the security, availability and reliability of all of our Red Hat software solutions hosted by us. Red Hat Network may be subscribed to at the time of and in addition to one of our RHEL offerings or on a stand alone basis. Revenue from enterprise subscriptions is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription. Through our retail distributors, we have historically sold Red Hat Linux consumer products. The retail product is currently offered in one version: Red Hat Professional Workstation. During fiscal 2004, Red Hat sold two different versions of Red Hat Linux (9 and Professional Workstation). In accordance with SOP 97 2, the revenue associated with products whose subscription period is 30 days or less is recognized immediately because the cost to us associated with such subscriptions is de minimis. For retail products whose subscription period is greater than 30 days, we recognize the revenue ratably over the period that the subscription services are provided. A reserve for sales returns is recognized for sales of retail software products to distributors, who have a right of return, based on our historical experience of sell through to the end user by the distributor. The return rate we experienced over the last three retail product releases has averaged 18.0%. Because we are able to estimate returns historically, within a reasonable degree of accuracy, we believe the fee is fixed and determinable, collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are estimable at the time its retail products sell into the retailer. Our retail customers do not receive the right to future upgrades or new versions of our technology. Embedded subscription revenue consists of revenue for technical support and maintenance services provided pursuant to software compiling, debugging, and optimization agreements. Revenue from embedded subscriptions is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement, which is typically 12 months. Services Revenue Services revenue is comprised of embedded development and enterprise services. Enterprise services are comprised of revenue for consulting services, engineering services, and customer training and education. Consulting services are provided under agreements where customers pay us on an hourly basis to assist in the deployment of our open source technologies. Revenue from customer training and education is recognized at the date the services are performed. Embedded development services are contracts for compiling, debugging and optimization of various open source software technologies. Revenue is recognized on the percentage of completion method, provided that we have the ability to make reliable estimates of progress towards completion, the fee for such services is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable. Impairment of Long Lived Assets We evaluate the recoverability of our property and equipment and other assets in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144). SFAS 144 requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale, whether previously held and used or newly acquired, and by broadening the presentation of discontinued operations to include more disposal transactions. An impairment loss is recognized when the net book value of such assets exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets or the business to which the assets relate. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the assets. 18 Table of Contents RESTATEMENT Our previously issued consolidated balance sheets as of February 29, 2004 and February 28, 2003 and consolidated statements of operations, of stockholders equity and of cash flows for the three fiscal years in the period ended February 29, 2004, have been restated to reflect our change in accounting to correct our method of revenue recognition related to subscription agreements. The restatement also reflects certain non recurring adjustments to our unaudited quarterly results for the first, second and third quarters of fiscal 2004 as more fully described in NOTE 3 Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements. Historically, we had recognized revenue for subscription agreements ratably on a monthly basis, meaning that for a one year subscription one twelfth of the subscription revenue was recognized in the calendar month of commencement of the subscription and the remaining revenue was recognized over the next 11 calendar months. In the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we began recognizing revenue over the term of each particular subscription agreement, beginning on the commencement date of the subscription agreement. The effect of using the new method on our previously reported financial statements is to defer a portion of the revenue that had been previously recognized in the month of commencement of a subscription to the month in which the subscription ends. See NOTE 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.

Subscription revenue increased 71.9% to $82.4 million for the year ended February 29, 2004 from $47.9 million for the year ended February 28, 2003. Enterprise technologies subscription Enterprise technologies subscription revenue primarily relates to both direct and indirect sales of Red Hat Enterprise Linux and other related software subscriptions such as Red Hat Clustering Suite and Systems Management Services provided by Red Hat Network. Enterprise technologies subscription revenue increased 123.7% to $67.0 million for the year ended February 29, 2004 from $29.9 million for the year ended February 28, 2003. For the fiscal year ended February 29, 2004, we sold approximately 169,500 subscriptions to our Red Hat Enterprise Linux offerings compared to 36,500 subscriptions in the previous fiscal year. The average number of units that were deployed during the year ended February 29, 2004 approximated 68,000 compared to approximately 13,500 in the same period in the prior year. Our RHEL products, AS, ES and WS, are sold under subscription agreements. These arrangements typically have a one year subscription period. The base subscription generally entitles the end user to one year of maintenance, which entitles the end user to configuration support, and updates and upgrades to the technology, when and if available, during the term of the subscription. Subscription volumes increased each quarter during fiscal 2004. The increase in sales volume is being driven by the market acceptance of using the Linux operating system in mission critical areas of computing by the large enterprise, as well as the strategic agreements we entered into with leading technology companies that provide for the distribution of Red Hat Enterprise Linux by these companies, which agreements are more fully discussed in Part I, Item 1 under Business Strategic Relationships above. Retail technologies Retail revenue, which consists of sales of Red Hat Linux and Professional Workstation to consumers through either value added resellers or distributors, decreased 7.9% to $13.5 million for the year ending February 29, 2004 from $14.7 million for the year ended February 28, 2003. This decrease is due to our focus on the sale of subscriptions to our enterprise technologies to large enterprises rather than on the consumer market. This market is no longer a strategic source of revenue for us, therefore we expect our retail revenues to continue to decline in fiscal 2005 as we will not aggressively promote new products through this channel. We expect that our retail revenues will be less than $5.0 million in fiscal 2005 unless we later decide to put new products into the retail channel. We do not believe that retail revenues are currently a significant component of our revenues. Embedded subscription Embedded subscription revenue decreased 42.5% to $1.9 million for the year ended February 29, 2004 from $3.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2003. The decrease in embedded subscription revenue is related to the expiration of support arrangements for semiconductor and telecommunication customers due to the weak performance of these industries in previous years that affected research and development spending. We are beginning to see additional interest in the use of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as an operating system for large devices such as network routing equipment and we believe there may be an opportunity to increase our participation in the embedded market. Services revenue Enterprise technologies services Enterprise technologies services revenues include fees received from enterprise customers for deployment of Red Hat Enterprise technologies, customer training and education fees and fees received for adding certain 20 Table of Contents functionality to Red Hat Enterprise Linux for our major hardware OEM partners. Enterprise technology services revenue decreased 2.0% to $37.8 million in the year ended February 29, 2004 from $38.5 million in the year ended February 28, 2003. The decrease in enterprise technologies services revenue is primarily due to a decrease in the revenues earned from agreements with our OEM partners of approximately $4.6 million and a $1.2 million decrease in consulting services related to services performed for large Enterprise customers for the deployment of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. These decreases were primarily offset by customer training and education services revenue which increased 41.1% to $23.7 million in year ended February 29, 2004 from $16.8 million in the year ended February 28, 2003. The increase is the direct result of the continued migration of larger enterprises to our Red Hat Enterprise Linux platform from a proprietary Unix platform, increasing the need to train system administrators and developers. Embedded services Embedded services revenue increased 19.8% to $4.6 million for the year ended February 29, 2004 from $3.8 million for the year ended February 28, 2003. The increase in embedded markets is due to the improvement in the semiconductor and telecommunications industries which has positively impacted research and development spending. We have maintained a small core team that maintains a strategic presence in this marketplace. Cost of revenue Cost of subscription revenue The cost of enterprise technologies and retail subscription revenue primarily consists of expenses we incur to manufacture, package, distribute and support our solutions. These costs include expenses for physical media, literature and packaging, fulfillment and shipping, labor related costs to provide technical support and maintenance (of which the largest component is labor cost). Cost of subscription revenue increased 13.8% to $9.3 million in the year ended February 29, 2004 from $8.2 million in the year ended February 28, 2003. This increase was entirely related to an increase in the cost of providing technical support and maintenance of our enterprise products which is primarily email or telephone support to end users. The increase in support costs was due to the increased number of subscriptions to Red Hat Enterprise Linux that we sold during fiscal 2004, approximately 169,500 compared to 36,500 in the prior fiscal year. As the number of subscriptions for Red Hat Enterprise Linux continues to increase, our cost of subscription revenues will also increase. Cost of services revenue Cost of services revenue is primarily comprised of salaries and related costs including non cash, stock based compensation charges incurred for our personnel to deliver custom development, open source consulting engineering, training and education, and hardware certification services. Cost of services revenue increased 8.6% to $24.3 million in the year ended February 29, 2004 from $22.3 million in the year ended February 28, 2003. The increase is directly related to the increase in our Enterprise technologies services revenue. The cost of our customer training and education services increased $3.8 million, which is consistent with the increase in revenue. This increase was partially offset by a $1.5 million decrease in our professional consulting costs related to headcount reductions to our consulting staff during fiscal 2004 as we have revised our consulting strategy to focus on strategic consulting and entered into agreements to provide people intensive development consulting. Gross profit Gross profit increased 53.2% to $90.8 million in the year ended February 29, 2004 from $59.3 million in the year ended February 28, 2003. This increase was entirely due to the increase in revenue and profitability related to our high gross margin Red Hat Enterprise Linux offerings. The growth and profitability of our Enterprise business was offset by a slight decline in the Embedded segment, which had gross profit of $2.6 million in fiscal 2004 as compared to $2.9 million in fiscal 2003. 21 Table of Contents Operating expenses Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs including non cash, stock based compensation charges for sales and marketing personnel, sales commissions, travel, public relations and marketing materials and tradeshows. Sales and marketing expense increased 22.0% to $40.8 million in the year ended February 29, 2004 from $33.4 million in the year ended February 28, 2003. This increase was primarily due to a $3.7 million increase in North America and $4.9 million increase related to our international operations. We have increased our sales force in all geographies in the past twelve months. These increases were partially offset by lower spending on marketing. Research and development Research and development expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs including non cash, stock based compensation charges for development of software technologies and systems management offerings. Research and development expense increased 18.0% to $26.5 million in the year ended February 29, 2004 from $22.4 million in the year ended February 28, 2003. The increase in research and development expense resulted from increased spending related to adding enterprise engineers to support the development and integration of our Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating systems and Red Hat Network and costs of research and development personnel from the acquisition of Sistina, Inc. in late December 2003. General and administrative General and administrative expense consists primarily of personnel and related costs including non cash, stock based compensation charges for general corporate functions, including finance, accounting, legal, human resources, facilities and information systems expenses. General and administrative expense increased 14.2% to $20.5 million in the year ended February 29, 2004 from $17.9 million in the year ended February 28, 2003. This increase relates primarily to increased administrative costs of approximately $800,000 as a result of international expansion activities and increased legal costs related to our various legal proceedings of approximately $300,000. We expect our general and administrative expenses across all functional areas, including legal, finance and human capital, to continue to increase in future periods as our business continues to expand. Amortization of intangibles Amortization of goodwill and intangibles expense decreased to $0.2 million in the year ended February 29, 2004 from $1.1 million in the year ended February 28, 2003. Costs incurred for acquiring trademarks, copyrights and patents are capitalized as intangibles and amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to five years. The decrease in amortization of intangibles expense was due to previously capitalized costs being fully amortized in fiscal 2003. Years Ended February 28, 2003 and February 28, 2002 Total revenue Total revenue increased 13.5% to $90.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2003 from $79.5 million in the year ended February 28, 2002. The increase was driven by significant growth in our enterprise subscription and services revenues of our business partially offset by a decline in the embedded segment of our business. Subscription revenue Subscription revenue increased to $47.9 million for the year ended February 28, 2003 from $42.9 million for the year ended February 28, 2002. 22 Table of Contents Enterprise technologies subscription Enterprise technologies revenue increased 68.8% to $29.9 million for the year ended February 28, 2003 from $17.7 million for the year ended February 28, 2002. For the fiscal year ended February 28, 2003, we sold approximately 36,500 subscriptions to our Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS operating system. This significantly exceeded managements expectations of the number of subscriptions to be sold in the initial year of the release of our Red Hat Enterprise Linux technologies. In addition, Red Hat Network, our systems management services offering, increased revenue by $1.8 million for the year ended February 28, 2003. Our enterprise offerings are sold with annual renewable subscriptions and all have 12 month revenue recognition periods to match the subscription period. Therefore, we will continue to recognize revenue on these subscriptions through fiscal 2004 and expect to increase the number of subscriptions sold to Red Hat Enterprise technologies sequentially quarter over quarter during the next 12 months. We are focused on building the first layer of renewable enterprise subscriptions which will begin to renew in the third quarter of our fiscal 2004. Retail technologies Retail revenue decreased 25.3% to $14.7 million for the year ended February 28, 2003 from $19.7 million for the year ended February 28, 2002. This decrease is due to our focus during fiscal 2003 on the sale of subscriptions to our enterprise technologies to large enterprise customers rather than on the consumer market. Retail technologies revenue has been separately stated on the accompanying Consolidated Statement of Operations as this market is no longer a strategic source of revenue for us but instead represents a channel for providing leading edge technology to sophisticated users. We are focused on the sale of subscriptions to our enterprise technologies to large enterprises rather than the consumer market. Embedded subscription Embedded subscription revenue decreased 39.7% to $3.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2003 from $5.5 million for the year ended February 28, 2002. The decrease in embedded markets is primarily due to the weak performance of the semiconductor and telecommunications industries that has affected research and development spending during this period. Services revenue Enterprise technologies services Enterprise technologies services revenue increased 58.2% to $38.5 million in the year ended February 28, 2003 from $24.4 million in the year ended February 28, 2002. The increase in enterprise technology services revenue is primarily due to an increase in the revenue earned from our relationships with OEM vendors of approximately $7.7 million and a $2.9 million increase in consulting services related to services performed for large enterprise customers for the deployment of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Customer training and education services revenue also increased 24.2% to $17.9 million in year ended February 28, 2003 from $14.4 million in the year ended February 28, 2002. The increase in all components of our services revenues is the direct result of the continued migration of larger enterprises to our Red Hat Enterprise Linux platform from a proprietary Unix operating system and the momentum behind the acceptance of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as a mission critical operating system for the large enterprise. Embedded Embedded services revenue decreased 68.9% to $3.8 million for the year ended February 28, 2003 from $12.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2002. The decrease in embedded services revenues is due to the continued weak performance of the semiconductor and telecommunications industries that has negatively affected research and development spending and due to our reduction in focus and decrease in the number of personnel dedicated to this business to a small core team that maintains a strategic presence in this marketplace. 23 Table of Contents Cost of revenue Cost of subscription revenue Cost of subscription revenue decreased 12.6% to $8.2 million in the year ended February 28, 2003 from $9.4 million in the year ended February 28, 2002. This decrease was related to a $1.4 million reduction in expenses incurred for physical media, literature, packaging and fulfillment related to our retail product, which is consistent with the decline in retail revenues, partially offset by an increase in the cost of providing technical support and maintenance for our enterprise products. Cost of services revenue Cost of services revenue increased $3.7 million or 19.9% to $22.3 million in the year ended February 28, 2003 from $18.6 million in the year ended February 28, 2002. The increase is directly related to the increase in our enterprise technologies services revenue. The cost of our customer training and education services increased $1.4 million and our enterprise consulting services increased by $5.2 million related to headcount additions to our consulting staff. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.9 million in embedded development services costs as a result of the restructuring of this segment which was completed in February 2002. Gross Profit Gross profit increased 16.8% to $59.2 million in the year ended February 28, 2003 from $50.7 million in the year ended February 28, 2002. This increase was entirely due to the increase in revenue and profitability related to our Red Hat Enterprise Linux offerings which were introduced during the fiscal year ended February 28, 2003 and carry significantly higher gross margins than our retail and embedded product offerings. The strength in growth and profitability of our enterprise business was offset by the significant decline in the embedded segment which had gross profit of $2.9 million in fiscal 2003 as compared to $10.3 million in fiscal 2002. Operating expenses Sales and marketing Sales and marketing expense decreased 6.1% to $33.4 million in the year ended February 28, 2003 from $35.6 million in the year ended February 28, 2002. This decrease was primarily due to a reduction in our spend on marketing activities of $2.3 million partially offset by an increase in enterprise sales costs as we increased the size of our direct outside sales force. Research and development Research and development expense increased 9.3% to $22.4 million in the year ended February 28, 2003 from $20.5 million in the year ended February 28, 2002. The increase in research and development expense resulted from increased spending of $4.8 million related to the addition of approximately 52 enterprise engineers during late fiscal 2002 and throughout fiscal 2003 to support the development and integration of our Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system and Red Hat Network, and was partially offset by a decrease of $2.9 million in non cash stock based compensation expenses as certain deferred compensation balances were fully amortized during fiscal 2003. General and administrative General and administrative expense decreased 19.4% to $17.9 million in the year ended February 28, 2003 from $22.2 million in the year ended February 28, 2002. This decrease resulted from a significant decrease in the 24 Table of Contents number of companies acquired during fiscal 2003 resulting in a decrease in merger and acquisition expenses to $522,000 for the year ended February 28, 2003 from $4.7 million for the year ended February 28, 2002 and a decrease in stock based compensation expense of $1.8 million, and was partially offset by increased health and directors and officers insurance costs and bad debt expenses. Amortization of goodwill and intangibles Amortization of goodwill and intangibles expense decreased to $1.1 million in the year ended February 28, 2003 from $49.5 million in the year ended February 28, 2002. The decrease in amortization of goodwill and intangibles is primarily due to the fact that for the year ended February 28, 2003, no amortization of goodwill was recorded as prescribed by new accounting principles. Costs incurred for acquiring trademarks, copyrights and patents as well as capitalized software are capitalized as intangibles and amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to five years. Amortization of intangibles expense was not materially different from year to year. Restructuring charges Restructuring charges for the year ended February 28, 2002, which totaled $56.1 million, consist of an impairment of $49.3 million in the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles related to acquisitions made in prior periods, various facility closings, and $5.7 million in severance and related expenses. These restructuring charges were primarily due to a sharpening of our focus on providing an enterprise class operating system, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, to significant enterprises. As a result, we terminated certain employees of Planning Technologies, Inc., (PTI) and all employees of Hells Kitchen Systems, Inc., (HKS) and Akopia, Inc. (Akopia) during fiscal 2002 as these technologies were aimed at the small and medium business market. In total, we terminated 160 employees. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we completed the re allocation of our resources to focus on the Global 2000 market which resulted in discontinuing our network consulting business. The additional restructuring charge in fiscal 2003 of $1.5 million related to some additional severance for employees affected by the restructuring who were not notified of their termination until after February 28, 2002. Other income (expense), net Interest income (expense), net, decreased to $10.8 million in the year ended February 28, 2003 from $15.5 million in the year ended February 28, 2002. These amounts are net of interest expense of $502,000 in the year ended February 28, 2003 and $172,000 in the year ended February 28, 2002. The decrease in interest income (expense), net, from an average return on our investments of 5.2% in fiscal 2002 to a return of 4.3% in fiscal 2003, resulted from reinvestment of proceeds from the sales and maturities of fixed income investments in a declining interest rate environment that existed throughout fiscal 2003. In addition, we incurred foreign currency losses of $829,000 in our fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 as a result of the weakening U.S. Dollar against the Euro and the Japanese Yen which reduced our other income in fiscal 2003. Discontinued operations During January 2002, we adopted a formal plan to discontinue our network consulting operations because these operations were not strategic to our decision to focus on developing an enterprise class operating system for large enterprise customers. Accordingly, the network consulting operations were accounted for as a discontinued operation beginning with the fiscal year 2001 consolidated financial statements. We completed the disposal of the network consulting operations in February 2002 through termination of associated employees. Loss on disposal of discontinued operations of $10.3 million in fiscal year 2002 included the write off of goodwill recorded in PTIs acquisition of Enterprise Network Systems, Inc., (ENS) of $9.6 million, severance and related costs of $0.4 million, and a provision against accounts receivable of $0.3 million. As a result of the termination of 160 employees due to the restructuring of our business and the discontinuing of our network consulting business, our annual payroll and payroll related costs were reduced by approximately $15.9 million beginning in March 2003. 25 Table of Contents ACQUISITIONS Sistina Software, Inc. In December 2003, we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of Sistina Software, Inc. (Sistina) in exchange for the issuance of 1,979,874 shares of our common stock and the assumption of all of the outstanding Sistina stock options valued, in the aggregate, at $30.7 million. The fair value of net tangible and intangible assets acquired in the transaction were $2.0 million and $3.0 million, respectively. The excess of purchase price over the fair values of the net assets acquired of $25.7 million has been recorded as goodwill. In addition, the transaction includes $12.0 million of contingent consideration based on an earn out structured in three tranches. The earn out is based on the achievement of certain bookings targets for the technologies and services previously sold by Sistina over the period beginning on December 23, 2003 and ending March 31, 2005. The number of shares issued under the earn out will be determined based on the average closing price of our common stock during the 10 trading days prior to issuance of each tranche of such earn out shares. No contingent consideration was earned during the initial earn out period, which ended on March 31, 2004. One of the keys to our business strategy is to receive increasing annual subscription revenues on a per server basis by providing additional value to our customers in the form of layers of technology that will be provided on top of our Red Hat Enterprise Linux operating system and through providing additional systems management services. Sistina provides us with a global file system solution which is our initial entry into the storage management marketplace. We completed this acquisition in December 2003 and it is too early to assess the results of this acquisition. Liquidity and Capital Resources We have historically derived a significant portion of our liquidity and operating capital from the sale of equity securities, including private sales of preferred stock and the sale of common stock in our initial and secondary public offerings, and from cash flows from operations. At February 29, 2004, we had total cash and investments of $941.4 million, which is comprised of $544.9 million in cash and cash equivalents, $63.7 million of short term, fixed income investments and $332.8 million of long term, fixed income investments. At February 28, 2003 we had total cash and investments of approximately $292.3 million. This significant increase in cash and investments during fiscal year 2004 is due to $584.7 million in net proceeds raised from the issuance of convertible debentures in January 2004 and approximately $61.6 million in cash generated from our operations during fiscal 2004. At February 29, 2004, cash and cash equivalents totaled $544.9 million, an increase of $499.6 million as compared to February 28, 2003. The increase in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2004 resulted primarily from: the issuance of the convertible debentures in January 2004, net of issuance of costs, of $584.7 million, cash provided by operations of $61.6 million, a total of $28.8 million in cash received from the exercise of common stock options and sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan, net cash acquired in the acquisition of Sistina of $3.4 million, and $4.1 million in employee income taxes withheld from the exercise of common stock options in February 2004 which were disbursed in March 2004. These sources of cash were offset by the purchase of investments in debt securities, net of sales of debt securities, of $150.7 million, purchases of property and equipment of $13.2 million, primarily related to the re implemenation of our Oracle instance, $15.0 million of cash, net, used to pay down our line of credit and $1.2 million of cash used to pay down capital lease obligations. Cash provided by operations of $61.6 million in the year ended February 29, 2004, represented the net income of $13.7 million, an increase in deferred revenue of $53.3 million, an increase in accounts payable of $1.5 million, an increase in accrued expenses of $2.0 million and net non cash charges of $12.4 million. These sources of cash were partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable of $18.5 million and an increase in 26 Table of Contents prepaid expenses and other current assets, including inventory, of $2.4 million. The increase in accounts receivable and deferred revenue primarily resulted from an increase in the number of subscriptions sold to Red Hat Enterprise Linux to 87,000 subscriptions in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 as compared to the sale of 21,500 subscriptions to Red Hat Enterprise Linux in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2003, cash used in operations was $758,000. The significant improvement in our cash flow from operations in fiscal 2004 is a result of increased sales of annual subscriptions to Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which resulted in the $53.3 million increase in deferred revenues, as well as managements continued focus on improved operating profits and preserving our cash balance. We do not believe that there are any collectibility or billing problems with our customers that have not been appropriately reserved at each balance sheet date. Cash used in investing activities of $160.5 million was comprised of the purchase of investments in debt securities, net of maturities, of $150.7 million, purchases of property and equipment mainly computer software, hardware and computer networking equipment totaling $13.2 million, offset by $3.4 million, net, of cash acquired in the acquisition of Sistina in late December 2003. The significant majority of the purchases of investments occurred as a result of the investment of a portion of the approximately $585 million in net proceeds received from the completion of the convertible debt offering in January 2004. Cash provided by financing activities of $597.3 million for the year ended February 29, 2004 was comprised of $584.7 million in net proceeds from the issuance of convertible senior debentures in January 2004, $4.1 million in employee income taxes withheld from the exercise of common stock options in February 2004 which were remitted to taxing authorities in March 2004 and $24.7 million, combined, in proceeds received from the exercise of common stock options by employees and the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan. These sources of cash were partially offset by $15.0 million of repayments, net of borrowings, made against our line of credit and $1.2 million in payments under capital lease obligations. In January 2004, we issued $600 million in convertible senior debentures to the initial purchaser, a sophisticated, accredited investor with a pre existing relationship with us, in a private placement pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the Securities Act), and the debentures were resold by the initial purchaser to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A of the Securities Act. The debentures mature on January 15, 2024 and bear interest at a rate of 0.5% per annum, payable semiannually on January 15 and July 15 of each year. The debentures are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The debentures are convertible into shares of our common stock under certain circumstances prior to maturity at a conversion rate of 39.0753 shares per $1,000 principal amount of debentures (which represents a conversion price of approximately $25.59 per share) subject to adjustment under certain conditions. We may redeem the debentures, in whole or in part, in cash at any time on or after January 15, 2009. Holders of the debentures may require us to redeem the debentures, in whole or in part, in cash on January 15 of 2009, 2014 and 2019. As of February 29, 2004, no debentures were redeemed. Accrued interest to the redemption date will be paid by us in any such redemption. No interest payments were made during the year ended February 29, 2004. Accrued interest at February 29, 2004 was $0.4 million. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion. At February 28, 2003, cash and cash equivalents totaled $45.2 million, a decrease of $10.2 million as compared to February 28, 2002. The decrease in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal 2003 resulted primarily from the following sources: the purchase of investments in debt securities, net of sales of debt securities, of $8.3 million, cash used by operations of $758,000, purchases of property and equipment of $6.8 million, cash used in the acquisition of a business of $1.2 million, and $764,000 used to fund stock repurchases. These uses of cash were offset by $4.9 million of cash raised from borrowings, net of repayments, and $3.0 million in cash received from the exercise of common stock options and sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan. Cash used in operations of $758,000 in the year ended February 28, 2003, represented the net loss of $6.7 million, an increase in accounts receivable of $8.3 million, an increase in prepaid expenses and other current assets of $2.6 million, a decrease in accounts payable of $1.0 million and a decrease in accrued expenses of 27 Table of Contents $6.3 million. These uses of cash were partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue of $9.6 million, an increase in deferred lease credits of $1.6 million and net non cash charges of $13.7 million. Cash used in operations during fiscal 2003 includes $2.5 million for payments of restructuring costs which contributed to the $6.3 million reduction in accrued expenses. In the fiscal year ended February 28, 2002, cash used in operations was $7.5 million. The significant improvement in our cash flow used in operations in fiscal 2003 is a result of managements increased focus on improved operating results and preserving our cash balance, as well as a result of sales of annual subscriptions to Red Hat Enterprise Linux, which resulted in the $9.6 million increase in our deferred revenues and the increase in our accounts receivable of $8.3 million. Cash used in investing activities of $16.2 million was comprised of the purchase of investments in debt securities, net of maturities, of $8.3 million, purchases of property and equipment mainly computer software, hardware and computer networking equipment totaling $6.8 million, and $1.2 million in cash used to acquire a business. As market interest rates declined throughout the fiscal year ended February 28, 2003, we used cash and cash equivalents to purchase fixed income debt securities to improve the yield on our investments. The $1.2 million used to acquire a business relates to cash paid in October 2002 as part of the acquisition cost of NOCpulse, Inc. Cash provided by financing activities of $5.8 million for the year ended February 28, 2003 was comprised of $4.9 million in net proceeds from borrowings from our line of credit and $3.0 million in proceeds received from the sale of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan and from the exercise of common stock options. This was partially offset by $764,000 used to purchase 200,000 shares of treasury stock during fiscal 2003, and $1.3 million in payments under capital lease obligations. We have experienced a substantial increase in our operating expenses since our inception in connection with the growth of our operations, the development of our Red Hat Enterprise Linux technologies, the expansion of our services operations and our acquisition activity. Our capital requirements during the year ending February 28, 2005 will depend on numerous factors including the amount of resources we devote to: funding the development of our Red Hat Enterprise Linux products, such as Red Hat Enterprise Linux AS, ES and WS; accelerating the development of our systems management services; improving and extending our services and the technologies used to deliver these services to our customers; pursuing strategic acquisitions and alliances; and making possible investments in businesses, products and technologies. We have made substantial progress in improving cash flow from operations. In fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, we used $.8 million, $7.5 million and $39.6 million, respectively, to fund our operations. In fiscal 2004, we generated $61.6 million in cash from our operations, more so than in any other fiscal period of our operating history. Our cash flow provided by operations for fiscal 2004, exceeded the expectations we had at the beginning of the fiscal year and is due to both the greatly increased demand for our products and services, which also affords us leverage in negotiating up front payments for annual subscriptions from customers, and the increase in the number of subscriptions sold for Red Hat Enterprise Linux in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. Given the significant improvement we have made from using cash to fund our operations and the $941.4 million of cash and investments held at February 29, 2004, we do not anticipate the need to raise cash to fund our operations either through the sale of additional equity or through the issuance of debt for the foreseeable future. However, we may take advantage of favorable capital market situations that may arise from time to time to raise additional capital. 28 Table of Contents We believe that cash flow from operations will continue to improve; however, there can be no assurances that we will improve our cash flow from operations from the current rate or that such cash flows will be adequate to fund other investments or acquisitions that we may choose to make. We may choose to accelerate the expansion of our business from our current plans, which may require us to raise additional funds through the sale of equity or debt securities or through other financing means. There can be no assurances that any such financing would occur in amounts or on terms favorable to us, if at all. We have no off balance sheet financing arrangements and do not utilize any structured debt, special purpose or similar unconsolidated entities for liquidity or financing purposes. As of February 29, 2004, our principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under capital and operating leases. The following table summarizes our principal contractual obligations at February 29, 2004 and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods (in thousands): Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years More than 5 Years Capital lease obligations $ 1,522 $ 1,109 $ 413 $ $ Operating lease obligations 53,126 4,515 11,308 6,220 31,083 Senior convertible debentures 600,000 600,000 Total $ 654,648 $ 5,624 $ 11,721 $ 6,220 $ 631,083 RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See discussion in NOTE 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 29 Table of Contents RISK FACTORS RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS We may not be able to timely release major product releases and upgrades to our products because we depend on the support of Linux developers not employed by us for improvements and advancement of our Red Hat Enterprise Linux technologies. We may not be able to release major product releases and upgrades of Red Hat Enterprise Linux on a timely basis because the heart of Red Hat Enterprise Linux, the Linux kernel, is maintained by third parties. Linus Torvalds, the original developer of the Linux kernel, and a small group of engineers, many of whom are not employed by us, are primarily responsible for the development and evolution of the Linux kernel. If this group of developers fails to further develop the Linux kernel or if Mr. Torvalds or prominent Linux developers who are members of this group and are currently employed by us were: to join one of our competitors, no longer be employed by us or no longer work on the Linux kernel, we would have to either rely on another party to further develop the kernel or develop it ourselves. We cannot predict whether enhancements to the kernel would be available from reliable alternative sources. We could be forced to rely to a greater extent on our own development efforts, which would increase our development expenses and may delay our product release and upgrade schedules. In addition, any failure on the part of the kernel developers to further develop and enhance the kernel could stifle the development of additional Linux based applications. If we fail to continue to establish and maintain strategic distribution and other collaborative relationships with industry leading companies, we may not be able to attract and retain a larger customer base. Our success depends in part on our ability to continue to establish and maintain strategic distribution and other collaborative relationships with industry leading hardware manufacturers (such as Hewlett Packard, Dell, IBM, Fujitsu and others), distributors, software vendors (such as Oracle) and enterprise solutions providers. These relationships allow us to offer our products and services to a much larger customer base than we would otherwise be able to through our direct sales and marketing efforts. We may not be able to maintain these relationships or replace them on attractive terms. In addition, our existing strategic relationships do not, and any future strategic relationships may not, afford us any exclusive marketing or distribution rights. As a result, many of the companies with which we have strategic alliances pursue alternative technologies and develop alternative products and services in addition to or in lieu of our products and services, either on their own or in collaboration with others, including our competitors. Moreover, we cannot guarantee that the companies with which we have strategic relationships will market our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales, marketing, and technical support. If third party enterprise software application providers do not continue to make their new applications compatible with our Linux based operating systems, our software will cease to be competitive. Our products will not be competitive unless new enterprise software applications continue to be compatible with our Linux based operating systems. We intend to encourage the development of additional applications that operate on Linux based operating systems by attracting third party developers to the Linux platform, providing open source tools to create these applications and maintaining our existing developer relationships through marketing and technical support for third party developers. If we are not successful in achieving these goals, however, our products will not be competitive and our sales growth will be adversely affected. We may be unable to predict the future course of open source technology development, which could reduce the market appeal of our products and damage our reputation. We do not exercise control over many aspects of the development of open source technology. Different groups of open source software programmers compete with one another to develop new technology. Typically, 30 Table of Contents the technology developed by one group will become more widely used than that developed by others. If we adopt new technology and incorporate it into our products and competing technology becomes more widely used or accepted, the market appeal of our products may be reduced and that could harm our reputation, diminish the Red Hat brand and result in decreased revenue. Because of characteristics of open source software, there are few technology barriers to entry in the open source market by new competitors, which could make it easier for companies with greater resources than us to compete with us. One of the characteristics of open source software is that anyone can modify the existing software or develop new software that competes with existing open source software. Such competition can develop without the degree of overhead and lead time required by traditional proprietary software companies. It is possible for a competitor with greater resources than ours to develop its own open source operating system solution, potentially reducing the demand for our solutions. We have entered into and may continue to enter into or seek to enter into business combinations and acquisitions, which may be difficult to integrate, disrupt our business, dilute stockholder value or divert management attention. We have acquired several businesses, including, most recently, Sistina Software, Inc. on December 23, 2003. As part of our business strategy, we may enter into additional business combinations and acquisitions in the future. We have limited experience in making acquisitions. In addition, acquisitions are typically accompanied by a number of risks, including: the difficulty of integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired companies; the maintenance of acceptable standards, controls, procedures and policies; the potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; the impairment of relationships with employees and customers as a result of any integration of new management and other personnel; the inability to maintain a relationship with customers of the acquired business; the difficulty of incorporating acquired technology and rights into our products and services; the potential failure to achieve the expected benefits of the combination or acquisition; expenses related to the acquisition; potential unknown liabilities associated with acquired businesses; and unanticipated expenses related to acquired technology and its integration into existing technology. If we are not successful in completing acquisitions that we may pursue in the future, we would be required to reevaluate our growth strategy and we may have incurred substantial expenses and devoted significant management time and resources in seeking to complete the acquisitions. In addition, with future acquisitions, we could use substantial portions of our available cash as all or a portion of the purchase price. We could also issue additional securities as consideration for these acquisitions, which could cause our stockholders to suffer significant dilution, or incur substantial debt. Any future acquisitions may not generate additional revenue for us. If we fail to effectively manage our growth, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected. We have expanded our operations rapidly in recent years. For example, our aggregate revenues increased from approximately $90.3 million for the year ended February 28, 2003 to approximately $124.7 million for the 31 Table of Contents year ended February 29, 2004. As of March 31, 2004, we had 681 employees, up from 566 as of March 31, 2003. In addition, we continue to explore ways to extend our product and service offerings, and geographic reach. Our growth has placed and may continue to place a strain on our management systems, information systems, resources and internal controls. Our ability to successfully offer products and services and implement our business plan requires adequate information systems and resources and oversight from our senior management. We have, with our audit committee, undertaken to review and improve our financial and managerial controls, reporting systems and procedures. We will need to continue to modify and improve these controls, systems and procedures and other internal controls and compliance procedures as we continue to grow and expand our business. As we grow, we must also continue to hire, train, supervise and manage new employees. We may not be able to hire, train, supervise and manage sufficient personnel or develop management and operating systems to manage our expansion effectively. If we are unable to manage our growth and improve our controls, systems and procedures, our operations and financial results could be adversely affected. RISKS RELATED TO LEGAL UNCERTAINTY We could be prevented from selling or developing our software if the GNU General Public License and similar licenses under which our products are developed and licensed are not enforceable. The Linux kernel and the Red Hat Linux operating system have been developed and licensed under the GNU General Public License and similar open source licenses. These licenses state that any program licensed under them may be liberally copied, modified and distributed. The GNU General Public license is a subject of litigation in the case of The SCO Group, Inc. v. International Business Machines Corp., pending in the United States District Court for the District of Utah. It is possible that a court would hold these licenses to be unenforceable in that litigation or that someone could assert a claim for proprietary rights in a program developed and distributed under them. Any ruling by a court that these licenses are not enforceable, or that Linux based operating systems, or significant portions of them, may not be liberally copied, modified or distributed, would have the effect of preventing us from selling or developing our products. Our subscription based contract model may encounter customer resistance. The subscription agreement for Red Hat Enterprise Linux requires customers to agree to a subscription for our systems management services for each machine on which they deploy Red Hat Enterprise Linux. At the same time, the subscription agreement places no restriction on the customers right to redistribute Red Hat Enterprise Linux. While we believe this practice fully complies with the requirements of the GNU General Public License, and while we have reviewed this practice with the Free Software Foundation, the organization that maintains and provides interpretations of the GNU General Public license, we may still encounter customer resistance to this distribution model. To the extent we are unsuccessful in promoting or defending this distribution model, our business and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. If our products are found to infringe third party intellectual property rights, we could be required to redesign our products, replace components of our products or enter into license agreements with third parties. We have committed to all of our customers with valid, registered Red Hat Enterprise subscriptions that if any portion of our Red Hat Enterprise Linux product is found to infringe any third party intellectual property rights we will, at our expense and option: (i) obtain the right for the customer to continue to use the product consistent with their subscription agreement with us; (ii) modify the product so that it is non infringing; or (iii) replace the infringing component with a non infringing component. Although we cannot predict whether we will need to satisfy this commitment, and although our subscription agreements typically state that our liability thereunder shall not exceed the amount a customer paid to us during the previous 12 months, satisfying the commitment could be costly and time consuming and could materially and adversely affect our financial results. In addition, our insurance policies may not adequately cover our exposure to this type of claim. 32 Table of Contents We are vulnerable to claims that our products infringe third party intellectual property rights because our products are comprised of distinct software components, many of which are developed by numerous independent parties, and an adverse legal decision affecting our intellectual property could materially harm our business. We are vulnerable to claims that our products infringe third party intellectual property rights because our products are comprised of distinct software components, many of which are developed by numerous independent parties. Claims for infringement of intellectual property rights may be filed and may seek damages and injunctive relief. In particular, third parties may assert claims for infringement or claims based on trade secret theories. The risk of infringement claims is exacerbated by the fact that much of the code in our products is developed by numerous independent parties over whom we exercise no supervision or control. It is further exacerbated by our lack of access to unpublished software patent applications. Claims of infringement could require us to seek to obtain licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, reengineer our products, or discontinue the sale of our products in the event reengineering could not be accomplished on a timely basis. SCO Group, Inc., or SCO, has publicly alleged that certain Linux kernels contain unauthorized UNIX code or derivative works. On August 4, 2003, we filed a complaint against SCO in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment that we are not infringing any of SCOs intellectual property rights. SCO, to date, has not asserted a claim of infringement against us. Uncertainty concerning SCOs allegations, regardless of their merit, could adversely affect sales of our products. If SCO were to prevail in this or other actions related to their claims regarding Linux, our business could be materially and adversely affected. Defending patent infringement, copyright infringement and or trade secret claims, even claims without significant merit, can be expensive. An adverse legal decision affecting our intellectual property could materially harm our business. Defending patent infringement, copyright infringement and or trade secret claims, even claims without significant merit, can be expensive. An adverse legal decision affecting our intellectual property could materially harm our business. Our products may contain defects that may be costly to correct, delay market acceptance of our products and expose us to litigation. Despite testing by ourselves and our customers, errors have been and may continue to be found in our products after commencement of commercial shipments. This risk is exacerbated by the fact that much of the code in our products is developed by independent parties over whom we exercise no supervision or control. If errors are discovered, we may have to make significant expenditures of capital to eliminate them and may not be able to successfully correct them in a timely manner or at all. Errors and failures in our products could result in a loss of, or delay in, market acceptance of our products and could damage our reputation and our ability to convince commercial users of the benefits of Linux based operating systems and other open source software products. In addition, failures in our products could cause system failures for our customers who may assert warranty and other claims for substantial damages against us. Although our license agreements with our customers typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product liability claims, it is possible that these provisions may not be effective or enforceable under the laws of some jurisdictions. In addition, our insurance policies may not adequately limit our exposure to this type of claim. These claims, even if unsuccessful, could be costly and time consuming to defend. Our efforts to protect our trademarks may not be adequate to prevent third parties from misappropriating our intellectual property rights. Our most valuable intellectual property is our collection of trademarks. The protective steps we have taken in the past have been, and may in the future continue to be, inadequate to deter misappropriation of our 33 Table of Contents trademark rights. Although we do not believe that we have suffered any material harm from misappropriation to date, we may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our trademark rights in a timely manner. We have registered some of our trademarks in the Americas, Europe, Asia and Australia and have other trademark applications pending in each of those regions. Effective trademark protection may not be available in every country in which we offer or intend to offer our products and services. Failure to adequately protect our trademark rights could damage or even destroy the Red Hat brand and impair our ability to compete effectively. Furthermore, defending or enforcing our trademark rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources. RISKS RELATED TO OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AND CONDITION We have incurred substantial net losses on a GAAP basis in the past and may not be able to increase or maintain profitability. We have incurred net losses in seven of our previous nine fiscal years. As of February 29, 2004, we had an accumulated deficit of $277.2 million. While we have achieved profitability in fiscal 2004 on a restated basis of $13.7 million, we cannot be certain that we will be able to sustain or increase profitability. Failure to increase or maintain profitability may adversely affect the market price of our common stock and our ability to raise capital and continue operations. You should not rely on our quarterly results of operations as an indication of our future results. Due to the unpredictability of the technology spending environment, our revenue and operating results have fluctuated and may continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter. We base our current and projected future expense levels in part on our estimates of future revenue. Our expenses are, to a large extent, fixed in the short term. We may not be able to adjust our spending quickly enough to protect our projected operating results for a quarter if our revenue in that quarter falls short of our expectations. If our future operating results fall below expectations of securities analysts or investors, the market price of our common stock may decline. We may not be able to effectively attract additional enterprise customers and preserve relationships with current enterprise customers, which could adversely affect revenue. Historically, we focused our sales and marketing efforts on product sales to individuals. In late fiscal 2002, we began to focus the predominant portion of our sales and marketing efforts on expanding our enterprise customer base. To this end, we have invested extensively to attract enterprise customers. While we have been successful to date in acquiring large enterprise customers, if we are unsuccessful in gaining additional large enterprise customers in the future or in securing subscription renewals from existing enterprise customers, it will adversely affect our future revenue. In addition, while our subscription agreements generally provide for renewals at prices that are the same as those in effect during the initial term or at then current list prices, there can be no assurance that customers will renew their subscription agreements at the end of the initial or any renewal term or that customers will not seek to condition any renewal on reduced prices. Any failure to obtain customer renewals, or reduction in prices upon renewal, could reduce future revenues. We may not be able to continue to attract capable management personnel. Over the past three years we have built our management team during a time of significant unemployment and downturn in the technology sector. This has given us the opportunity to attract highly capable management personnel. However, our ability to retain key management personnel or hire capable new management personnel as we grow may be challenged if the technology sector rebounds and or if companies with more generous compensation packages or greater perceived growth opportunities compete for the same personnel. We depend on our key personnel. Our future success depends on the continued services of a number of key officers, including our Chief Executive Officer and President, Matthew J.Szulik, our Executive Vice President Engineering, Paul Cormier, 34 Table of Contents our Executive Vice President Chief Financial Officer, Kevin B. Thompson and our Executive Vice President Worldwide Sales, Alex Pinchev. The loss of the technical knowledge and industry expertise of any of these individuals could seriously impede our success. Moreover, the loss of one or a group of our key employees, particularly to a competitor, and any resulting loss of customers could reduce our market share and diminish the Red Hat brand. We may lack the financial and operational resources needed to increase our market share and compete effectively with operating systems providers, Microsoft, other established operating systems developers, software development tools developers, and certain infrastructure service providers. In the market for operating systems, we face significant competition from larger companies with greater financial resources and name recognition than we have. These competitors, which offer hardware independent multi user operating systems for Intel platforms and or UNIX based operating systems, include Microsoft, Novell, IBM, Sun Microsystems, Hewlett Packard and Unisys. In the future, these competitors may develop and market a competing open source operating system. As we increase our services offerings, we may face competition from larger companies that currently provide service and training related to the Linux operating system as well as other operating systems, particularly UNIX based operating systems, due to the fact that Linux and UNIX based operating systems share many common features. These companies, including IBM and Hewlett Packard, may be able to leverage their existing service organizations and provide higher levels of consulting and training on a more cost effective basis than we can. We may not be able to compete successfully with current or potential competitors. We may not be able to meet the operational and financial challenges that we will encounter as our international operations, which represented approximately 31% of our total revenue for the year ended February 29, 2004, continue to expand. Our international operations accounted for 31% of total revenue for the year ended February 29, 2004. As we expand our international operations, we will face a number of additional challenges associated with the conduct of business overseas. For example: we may have difficulty managing and administering a globally dispersed business; fluctuations in exchange rates may negatively affect our operating results; we have to comply with a wide variety of foreign laws; we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property rights overseas due to the uncertainty of laws and enforcement in certain countries relating to the protection of intellectual property rights; export controls and times of crisis could prevent us from shipping our products into and out of certain markets; changes in import/export duties and quotas could affect the competitive pricing of our products and services and reduce our market share in some countries; and economic or political instability in some international markets could result in the forfeiture of some foreign assets and the loss of sums spent developing and marketing those assets. Any failure by us to effectively manage the challenges associated with the international expansion of our operations could adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition. 35 Table of Contents
