ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis is a summary and should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes which are included in this Annual Report and the information under the caption "Risk Factors". We use a 52 53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest March 31. Fiscal 2002, fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 each reflect a 52 week period. OVERVIEW We began operations in 1968 as a designer and marketer of premium quality mens clothing and sportswear. Since our inception, we have grown through increased sales of existing product lines, the introduction of new brands and products, expansion into international markets, development of our retail operations, and acquisitions. Over the last five full fiscal years, our net revenues have grown to approximately $2.4 billion in fiscal 2002, from approximately $1.5 billion in fiscal 1998, while income from operations, excluding restructuring charges, has grown to approximately $309.2 million in fiscal 2002, from approximately $199.8 million in fiscal 1998. Our net revenues are generated from our three integrated operations: wholesale, retail and licensing. The following table sets forth net revenues for the last five fiscal years. Fiscal 2002 reflects the change in the fiscal year end of certain of our European subsidiaries as reported in our consolidated financial statements. See Consolidation of European Entities Change in Reporting Period. FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 30, MARCH 31, APRIL 1, APRIL 3, MARCH 28, 2002 2001 2000 1999 1998 (IN THOUSANDS) Wholesale sales........ $1,198,060 $1,053,842 $ 885,246 $ 859,498 $ 742,674 Retail sales........... 924,273 928,577 833,980 659,352 570,751 Net sales.............. 2,122,333 1,982,419 1,719,226 1,518,850 1,313,425 Licensing revenue...... 241,374 243,355 236,302 208,009 167,119 Net revenues........... $2,363,707 $2,225,774 $1,955,528 $1,726,859 $1,480,544 Wholesale net sales result from the sale of our mens and womens apparel to wholesale customers, principally to major department stores, specialty stores and non company operated Polo Ralph Lauren stores located primarily in Europe and Asia. Net sales for the wholesale division increased to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2002 from $742.7 million in fiscal 1998. This increase was primarily a result of growth in sales of our existing Polo Brands and Collection Brands products and the introduction of new brands. The increase also reflects the acquisition of the wholesale operations of Poloco S.A.S., including some of its affiliates, and PRL Fashions of Europe S.R.L. in January 2000 and October 2001, respectively. We generate retail sales from our full price Polo Ralph Lauren stores, outlet stores and Club Monaco stores. Net sales for the retail division grew to $924.3 million in fiscal 2002 from 27 $570.8 million in fiscal 1998. This increase was primarily a result of our expansion of our existing retail operations and growth through acquisitions, including the Poloco transaction and our acquisition of Club Monaco in fiscal 2000. Retail sales were essentially flat from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002 due to the highly competitive and promotionally driven retail store environment. At March 30, 2002, we operated 236 stores: six Ralph Lauren stores, 33 Polo Ralph Lauren stores, 55 Club Monaco full price stores, 94 Polo outlet stores, 22 Polo Jeans Co. outlet stores, 16 European outlet stores and ten Club Monaco outlet stores. Licensing revenue consists of royalties paid to us under our agreements with our licensing partners. Product, international and Ralph Lauren Home licensing alliances accounted for 51.9%, 25.9% and 22.2% of total licensing revenue in fiscal 2002 and 56.0%, 24.2% and 19.8% of total licensing revenue in fiscal 2001. Through these alliances, we combine our core skills with the product or geographic competencies of our licensing partners to create and develop specific businesses. The growth of existing and development of new businesses under licensing alliances have resulted in an increase in licensing revenue to $241.4 million in fiscal 2002 from $167.1 million in fiscal 1998. Beginning in fiscal 2000, we have undertaken the following: In October 2001, we acquired PRL Fashions of Europe S.R.L., which holds licenses to sell our womens Ralph Lauren apparel in Europe, as well as our mens and boys Polo Ralph Lauren and our Polo Jeans Co. apparel in Italy. In October 2001, we acquired the Ralph Lauren store in Brussels from one of our licensees. In February 2000, we announced the formation of Ralph Lauren Media, LLC, a joint venture between ourselves and National Broadcasting Company, Inc. and certain of its affiliated companies. RL Media, in which we have a 50% interest, operates the Polo.com website, which sells Polo Ralph Lauren products. NBC has provided television commercial spots promoting Polo.com, and we provide inventory to RL Media at cost. In January 2000, we completed the acquisition of stock and selected assets of Poloco S.A.S. and some of its affiliates, which hold licenses to sell our mens and boys Polo apparel, our mens and womens Polo Jeans apparel, and some of our accessories in Europe. In addition to acquiring Polocos wholesale business, we acquired one Polo Ralph Lauren store in Paris and six outlet stores located in France, the United Kingdom and Austria. In 1999, we acquired Club Monaco, Inc. Founded in 1985, Club Monaco is an international specialty retailer of casual apparel and other accessories which are sold under the "Club Monaco" brand name and associated trademarks. In connection with our growth strategies, we plan to introduce new products and brands and expand our retail operations. Implementation of these strategies may require significant investments for advertising, furniture and fixtures, infrastructure, design and additional inventory. Notwithstanding our investment, we cannot assure you that our growth strategies will be successful. 28 RESTRUCTURINGS AND SPECIAL CHARGES FISCAL 2001 RESTRUCTURING AND SPECIAL CHARGES During fiscal 2001, we completed an internal operational review and formalized our plans to enhance the growth of our worldwide luxury retail business, to better manage inventory and increase our overall profitability. The major initiatives of the operational review included: refining our retail strategy; developing efficiencies in our supply chain; and consolidating corporate business functions and internal processes. We will continue to refine our retail strategy by, among other things, expanding the presence of our full line luxury stores, both in North America and abroad. In connection with this initiative, we closed all 12 Polo Jeans Co. full price retail stores, which were underperforming, and 11 underperforming Club Monaco retail stores. Additionally, as a result of changes in market conditions combined with our change in retail strategy in selected locations in which we operate full price retail stores, we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of the assets of certain of these stores. We concluded from the results of this evaluation that a significant permanent impairment of long lived assets had occurred. Accordingly, we recorded a write down of these assets (primarily leasehold improvements) to their estimated fair value based on discounted future cash flows. In connection with the implementation of the operational review discussed above, we recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of $128.6 million in our second quarter of fiscal 2001, subsequently adjusted for a $5.0 million reduction of liabilities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. The major components of the charge were asset write downs of $98.8 million, lease and contract termination costs of $15.7 million, severance and termination benefits of $8.0 million and other restructuring costs of $1.1 million. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded an additional $16.0 million of lease termination costs associated with the closure of our retail stores due to market factors that were less favorable than originally estimated. The development of operating efficiencies in our worldwide logistics and supply chain management will better support our growing and increasingly global operations. In connection with initiating this aspect of the Operational Plan, we recorded $37.9 million of inventory write downs in our second quarter of fiscal year 2001 associated with our planned acceleration in the reduction of aged inventory, subsequently adjusted for additional write downs of inventory of $3.6 million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. The implementation of our operational review also included the consolidation of some corporate strategic business functions and internal processes. Costs associated with this aspect of the plan included the termination of operating contracts, streamlining of some corporate and operating functions, and employee related matters. These costs aggregated $18.1 million and were recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2001. Total severance and termination benefits resulting from the Operational Plan related to approximately 550 employees, all of whom have been terminated. Total cash outlays related to the operational review are expected to be approximately $40.7 million, $25.7 million of which had been paid through March 30, 2002. We completed the implementation of our operational review in fiscal 2002 and expect to settle the remaining liabilities in fiscal 2003. 29 FISCAL 1999 RESTRUCTURING During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, we formalized our plans to streamline operations within our wholesale and retail operations and reduce our overall cost structure. The major initiatives of our restructuring plan included: an evaluation of our retail operations and site locations; the realignment and operational integration of our wholesale operating units; and the realignment and consolidation of corporate strategic business functions and internal processes. Costs associated with our restructuring plan included lease and contract termination costs, store fixed assets (primarily leasehold improvements) and intangible asset write downs and severance and termination benefits. In fiscal 2000, we closed three Polo Ralph Lauren stores and three outlet stores that were not performing at an acceptable level and converted two Polo Ralph Lauren stores and five outlet stores to new concepts expected to be more productive. Our wholesale operations were realigned into two new operating units: Polo Brands and Collection Brands. Aspects of this realignment included: the reorganization of the sales force and retail development areas; the streamlining of the design and development process; and the consolidation of the customer service departments. We also integrated the sourcing and production of our Polo Brands, outlet store and licensees products into one consolidated unit. Costs associated with the wholesale realignment consisted primarily of severance and termination benefits and lease and contract termination costs. Our review of our corporate business functions and internal processes resulted in a new management structure designed to better align businesses with similar functions and to identify and eliminate duplicative processes. Costs associated with the corporate realignment consisted primarily of severance and termination benefits and lease and contract termination costs. We recorded a restructuring charge of $58.6 million on a pre tax basis in our fourth quarter of fiscal 1999. The major components of the restructuring charge included lease and contract termination costs of $24.7 million, asset write downs of $17.8 million, severance and termination benefits of $15.3 million and other restructuring costs of $0.8 million. Total severance and termination benefits as a result of our restructuring plan related to approximately 280 employees, all of whom have been terminated. Total cash outlays related to the Restructuring Plan are approximately $39.5 million, $36.8 million of which have been paid through March 30, 2002. We completed the implementation of the Restructuring Plan in fiscal 2000 and expect to settle the remaining liabilities in accordance with contract terms which extend until fiscal 2003. 30 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The table below sets forth the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain items in our consolidated statements of income for our last three fiscal years: FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 30, MARCH 31, APRIL 1, 2002 2001 2000 Net sales............................................ 89.8% 89.1% 87.9% Licensing revenue.................................... 10.2 10.9 12.1 Net revenues......................................... 100.0 100.0 100.0 Gross profit......................................... 48.5 47.8 48.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses......... 35.4 36.9 35.2 Restructuring and special charges.................... 0.7 5.6 Income from operations............................... 12.4 5.3 13.5 Foreign currency gains............................... 0.1 0.2 Interest expense..................................... (0.8) (1.1) (0.8) Income before income taxes........................... 11.7% 4.4% 12.7% CONSOLIDATION OF EUROPEAN ENTITIES CHANGE IN REPORTING PERIOD Effective December 30, 2001, for reporting purposes the Company changed the fiscal year ends of certain of its European subsidiaries as reported in the consolidated financial statements to the Saturday closest to March 31 to conform with the fiscal year end of the Company. Previously, certain of the European subsidiaries were consolidated and reported on a three month lag with a fiscal year ending December 31. Accordingly, the net activity for the three month period ended December 29, 2001, for the European subsidiaries that were reported on a three month lag is reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings in the accompanying financial statements. The following represents summarized results for those European operations for the three month period ended December 29, 2001 (in millions): THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2001: Net sales................................................... $49.5 Gross profit................................................ 25.5 Pre tax loss................................................ (0.7) Income tax benefit.......................................... 0.3 Net loss.................................................... (0.4) The following represents summarized consolidated results for the year ended March 30, 2002 as if the European subsidiaries continued reporting on a three month lag basis: FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 30, 2002: Wholesale net sales......................................... $1,118.5 Retail net sales............................................ 927.4 Net sales................................................... 2,045.9 Licensing revenue........................................... 241.0 Net revenues................................................ 2,286.9 Gross profit................................................ 1,105.8 Pre tax income.............................................. 255.5 Income tax provision........................................ 95.8 Net income.................................................. $ 159.7 31 FISCAL 2002 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2001 NET SALES. Net sales increased 7.1% to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2002 from $2.0 billion in fiscal 2001. Wholesale net sales increased 13.7% to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2002 from $1.1 billion in fiscal 2001. Wholesale growth primarily reflects the benefit from the inclusion of two strong quarters for the periods January through March 2002 and 2001 for certain of the European entities. See Consolidation of European Entities Change in Reporting Period. The impact of consolidating the European subsidiaries on a March 30 fiscal year resulted in an increase in Wholesale revenues of approximately $80.0 million, 7.1%. Retail sales decreased by less than 1.0 % to $924.3 million in fiscal 2002 from $928.6 million in fiscal 2001. Our Polo Ralph Lauren full price stores decreased $14.3 million and our Club Monaco stores decreased $8.4 million due to the effects of a promotionally driven and highly competitive retail store environment and the current economic conditions exacerbated by the events of September 11th. Also contributing to the decrease was the closing, in connection with our Operational Plan, of our Polo Jeans Co. full price retail stores during fiscal 2001, which had sales of $18.0 million during fiscal 2001. These decreases were offset by significant increases in our outlet business of approximately $29.8 million. The impact of consolidating the European subsidiaries on a March 30 fiscal year resulted in a decrease in retail revenues of approximately $3.0 million, less than 1%. See Consolidation of European Entities Change in Reporting Period. Comparable store sales, which represent net sales of stores open in both reporting periods for the full portion of such periods, decreased 3.0%. The comparable store declines were due to the effects of a promotionally driven and highly competitive retail environment. At March 30, 2002, we operated 236 stores: six Ralph Lauren stores, 33 Polo Ralph Lauren stores, 55 Club Monaco full price stores, 94 Polo outlet stores, 22 Polo Jeans Co. outlet stores, 16 European outlet stores and ten Club Monaco outlet stores. LICENSING REVENUE. Licensing revenue decreased approximately $2.0 million, representing less than a 1% decrease, to $241.4 million in fiscal 2002 to $243.4 million in fiscal 2001. Increases from one licensee within our home collection business and from our international licensed business, particularly in Asia, were offset by decreased royalty revenue from a significant product licensee and decreased royalties from our Italian licensee, the business and certain assets of which we acquired in October 2001. The impact of consolidating the European subsidiaries on a March 30 fiscal year increased licensing revenues by approximately $0.4 million, less than 1%. See Consolidation of European Entities Change in Reporting Period. GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 48.5% in fiscal 2002 from 47.8% in fiscal 2002. This increase was mainly attributable to wholesale gross margins in that $41.5 million of inventory write downs were recorded in fiscal 2001 in connection with the implementation of our operational review and our decision to accelerate the disposition of aged inventory. In addition, retail gross margins decreased 1.4% due to the effects of a promotionally driven and highly competitive retail store environment, resulting in higher markdowns taken. The impact of consolidating the European subsidiaries on a March 30 fiscal year increased gross profit by approximately $41 million, representing less than 4% of total gross profit and less than 0.2 gross percentage points. See Consolidation of European Entities Change in Reporting Period. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 35.4% in fiscal 2002 from 36.9% in fiscal 2001. This decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to a charge of $18.1 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2001 relating to nonrecurring charges associated with targeted opportunities for improvement, including the termination of operating contracts, streamlining of certain corporate and operating functions, and employee related matters. In addition, the Company has recorded $2.9 million of gain on the sale of our 50% joint venture interest in a 44,000 square foot building located in the 32 SoHo district of New York City. The impact of consolidating the European subsidiaries on a March 30 fiscal year increased selling, general and administrative expenses by approximately $20 million, less than 3%. See Consolidation of European Entities Change in Reporting Period. INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense decreased to $19.0 million in fiscal 2002 from $25.1 million in fiscal 2001. This decrease was due to lower levels of borrowings and the repayment of approximately $53 million of short term borrowings during the fiscal year. In addition, we repurchased $10.6 million of our outstanding Euro debt in fiscal 2002. INCOME TAXES. The effective tax rate decreased to 37.5% in fiscal 2002 from 39.5% in fiscal 2001, resulting from the implementation of tax strategies. FISCAL 2001 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2000 NET SALES. Net sales increased 15.3% to $2.0 billion in fiscal 2001 from $1.7 billion in fiscal 2000. Wholesale net sales increased 19.0% to $1.1 billion in fiscal 2001 from $885.2 million in fiscal 2000. Wholesale growth primarily reflected the benefit of one year of operations for Polocos wholesale division included in operating results for the first time in fiscal 2001, resulting in an additional $153.0 million in sales and an approximately 100% increase in unit sales of our luxury products. Retail sales increased by 11.3% to $928.6 million in fiscal 2001 from $834.0 million in fiscal 2000. This increase was primarily attributable to a $131.7 million benefit from the following: new stores opened in fiscal 2001 (37 stores, prior to 34 store closures in late fiscal 2001) with additional sales of $52.4 million; a full year of revenues from new stores opened in fiscal 2000 of $40.7 million; and the inclusion of the results of one Ralph Lauren and six outlet stores purchased in connection with the acquisition of Poloco with sales of $38.6 million. Although our stores remained highly productive, comparable store sales decreased by 5.3%. The decline was due to a mature and promotionally driven outlet environment and lower sales in Club Monacos Canadian stores. LICENSING REVENUE. Licensing revenue increased 3.0% to $243.4 million in fiscal 2001 from $236.3 million in fiscal 2000. This increase is primarily attributable to increases in sales of existing mens, womens, and childrens apparel, accessories and fragrance products. These gains, which resulted in $12.0 million in additional revenue, were partially offset by decreases in sales of Ralph Lauren Home collection products, which resulted in $5.0 million less revenue. GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 47.8% in fiscal 2001 from 48.7% in fiscal 2000. This decrease was mainly attributable to $41.5 million of inventory write downs recorded in fiscal 2001 in connection with the implementation of our operational review and our decision to accelerate the disposition of aged inventory. Excluding these special charges, gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was 49.6%. This improvement reflects increased wholesale gross margins as a result of the acquisition of Poloco, which generates more than 30% higher margins than our domestic wholesale operations. Additionally, gross profit was favorably impacted by the increase in licensing revenue in fiscal 2001 of $7.1 million, which has no associated cost of goods sold. These improvements were offset by declines in our retail gross margins of 1.5 percentage points as we incurred higher markdowns in fiscal 2001. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased to 36.9% in fiscal 2001 from 35.2% in fiscal 2000. This increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues was partially due to a charge of $18.1 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2001 relating to 33 nonrecurring charges associated with targeted opportunities for improvement, including the termination of operating contracts, streamlining of certain corporate and operating functions, and employee related matters. Additionally, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenues increased due to an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of $12.0 million, start up costs associated with the expansion of the Club Monaco retail operations of $8.6 million and expenses of $2.3 million relating to Poloco, which was acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. INTEREST EXPENSE. Interest expense increased to $25.1 million in fiscal 2001 from $15.0 million in fiscal 2000. This increase was due to a higher level of borrowings during the period attributable to the additional financing used for the acquisition of Poloco. INCOME TAXES. The effective tax rate decreased to 39.5% in fiscal 2001 from 40.8% in fiscal 2000. This decline is primarily a result of the benefit of tax strategies implemented by us. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our cash requirements primarily derive from working capital needs, construction and renovation of shop within shops, retail expansion and other corporate activities. Our main sources of liquidity are cash flows from operations, credit facilities and other borrowings. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $293.8 million in fiscal 2002 from $100.3 million in fiscal 2001. Net cash provided by operations was positively impacted in fiscal 2002 by increased net income, decreased inventory levels and the collection of the income tax receivable related to fiscal 2001 and negatively impacted by increased accounts receivable. Net cash used in investing activities decreased to $116.0 million in fiscal 2002 from $131.3 million in fiscal 2001. The decrease primarily resulted from decreased capital expenditures during the year. Net cash used by financing activities was $40.3 million in fiscal 2002 as compared to $25.9 million in fiscal 2001. This change is primarily due to the repayment of short term borrowings offset, in part, by the proceeds received in connection with the exercise of stock options. In June 1997, we entered into a credit facility with a syndicate of banks which provides for a $225.0 million revolving line of credit available for the issuance of letters of credit, acceptances and direct borrowings and matures on December 31, 2002. Borrowings under the syndicated bank credit facility bear interest, at our option, at a base rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 1/2 of one percent, and the prime commercial lending rate of The Chase Manhattan Bank in effect from time to time, or at the Eurodollar Rate (LIBOR) plus an interest margin based on the Federal Reserve Boards "Eurocurrency Liabilities" reserve requirements. The margin was 0.875% as of March 30, 2002. In March 1999, in connection with our acquisition of Club Monaco, we entered into a $100.0 million senior credit facility with a syndicate of banks consisting of a $20.0 million revolving line of credit and an $80.0 million term loan. The revolving line of credit is available for working capital needs and general corporate purposes and matures on June 30, 2003. The term loan was used to finance the acquisition of all of the outstanding common stock of Club Monaco and to repay indebtedness of Club Monaco. The term loan is also repayable on June 30, 2003. Borrowings under the 1999 syndicated bank credit facility bear interest, at our option, at a base rate equal to the higher of the Federal Funds Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 1/2 of one percent, and the prime commercial lending rate of The Chase Manhattan Bank in effect from time to time, or at the Eurodollar Rate (LIBOR) plus an interest margin based on the Federal Reserve Boards "Eurocurrency Liabilities" reserve requirements. The margin was 0.875% as of March 30, 2002. In April 1999, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $100.0 million to convert the variable interest rate on our 1999 senior credit facility to a fixed rate of 5.5%. 34 Our 1997 bank credit facility and our 1999 senior bank credit facility require that we maintain: a minimum consolidated net worth, and a maximum consolidated indebtedness ratio. Each of these credit facilities also contain covenants that, subject to specified exceptions, restrict our ability to: make capital expenditures, sell or dispose of our assets, incur additional debt, incur contingent liabilities and liens, merge with or acquire other companies or be subject to a change of control, make loans or advances or stock repurchases, engage in transactions with affiliates, and make investments. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under each of these credit facilities, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the credit facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The credit facilities specify a number of events of default, many of which are subject to applicable grace or cure periods, including, among others, the failure to make timely principal and interest payments, to satisfy the covenants, or to maintain the required financial performance requirements described above. Additionally, the agreements provide that an event of default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren and related entities fail to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power of our common stock. In November 1999, we issued Euro 275.0 million of 6.125% notes due November 2006. Our Euro debt is listed on the London Stock Exchange. The net proceeds from the Euro offering were $281.5 million, based on the Euro exchange rate on the issuance date. Interest on the Euro debt is payable annually. A portion of the net proceeds from the issuance was used to acquire Poloco while the remaining net proceeds were retained for general corporate purposes. We acquired Poloco for an aggregate cash consideration of $209.7 million, plus the assumption of $10.0 million in short term debt. During fiscal 2002 and 2001, we repurchased Euro 11.9 million and 27.5 million, or approximately $10.6 million and $25.3 million based on Euro exchange rates at the time of repurchase, of our outstanding Euro debt. As of March 30, 2002, we had $33 million outstanding in direct borrowings, $80 million outstanding under the term loan and $205 million outstanding in Euro debt, based on the year end Euro exchange rate. We were also contingently liable for $17.2 million in outstanding letters of credit related primarily to commitments for the purchase of inventory. The weighted average interest rate on our borrowings at March 30, 2002 was 5.9%. We recognize foreign currency gains or losses in connection with our Euro debt based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. We recorded $1.8 million in foreign currency gains in fiscal 2002 and $5.8 million in foreign currency gains in fiscal 2001. During the second quarter of fiscal 2001, we completed an internal operational review and formalized our plans to enhance the growth of our international luxury retail business, to better manage inventory and to increase our overall profitability. In connection with the implementation of the operational review, we recorded a pretax restructuring charge of $128.6 million in our 35 second quarter of fiscal 2001, subsequently adjusted for a $5.0 million reduction of liabilities in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002, we recorded an additional $16.0 million of lease termination costs associated with the closure of our retail stores due to market factors that were less favorable than originally estimated. On October 18, 2000, we received consent from our lenders under the credit facilities permitting us to incur the charges we recorded in connection with the operational review up to specified thresholds. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Total cash outlays related to the operational plan are expected to be approximately $40.7 million, $25.7 million of which have been paid through March 30, 2002. We completed the implementation of the operational plan in fiscal 2002 and expect to settle the remaining liabilities in fiscal 2003. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, we formalized our plans to streamline operations within our wholesale and retail operations and reduce our overall cost structure. Total cash outlays resulting from the 1999 restructuring plan are approximately $39.5 million, $36.8 million of which have been paid through March 30, 2002. We completed the implementation of the Restructuring Plan in fiscal 2000 and expect to settle the remaining liabilities in accordance with contract terms which extend until fiscal 2003. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. From time to time, we make contributions to various charitable organizations. In the quarter ended March 30, 2002, we made a contribution of approximately $8 million to the Polo Ralph Lauren Foundation, which provides philanthropic and volunteer support to organizations focused on health, educational and cultural initiatives. Capital expenditures were $88.0 million in fiscal 2002, $105.2 million in fiscal 2001 and, $122.0 million in fiscal 2000. Capital expenditures primarily reflect costs associated with the following: the expansion of our distribution facilities; the shop within shops development program which includes new shops, renovations and expansions; the expansion of our retail operations; our information systems; and other capital projects. On October 31, 2001, we completed the acquisition of substantially all of the assets of PRL Fashions of Europe S.R.L., which holds licenses to sell our womens Ralph Lauren apparel in Europe, our mens and boys Polo Ralph Lauren apparel in Italy, and our mens and womens Polo Jeans Co. collections in Italy. The purchase price was approximately $22.0 million in cash, plus the assumption of certain liabilities and earn out payments based on achieving profitability targets over the first three years, with a guaranteed minimum annual payment of $3.5 million each year. In March 1998, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, subject to market conditions, of up to $100.0 million of our Class A common stock. Share repurchases were made in the open market over the two year period which commenced April 1, 1998. The Board of Directors has extended the stock repurchase program through March 31, 2004. Shares acquired under the repurchase program will be used for stock option programs and for other corporate purposes. As of March 30, 2002, we repurchased 3,876,506 shares of our Class A common stock at an aggregate cost of $73.2 million. We extend credit to our customers, including those who have accounted for significant portions of our net revenues. We had three customers, Dillard Department Stores, Inc., 36 Federated Department Stores, Inc. and The May Department Stores Company, who in aggregate constituted approximately 35% of trade accounts receivable outstanding at March 30, 2002, 52.0% at March 31, 2001 and 54.0% at April 1, 2000. The concentration of our trade accounts receivable has declined in recent periods, and is expected to continue to decline, as we have diversified our distribution channels and the proportion of department stores in our customer mix has declined as a result of our expansion in Europe. Additionally, we had four licensing partners, Jones Apparel Group, Inc., WestPoint Stevens, Inc., Seibu Department Stores, Ltd. and Warnaco, Inc., who in aggregate constituted approximately 55.0%, 53.0%, and 58.0% of licensing revenue in fiscal 2002, fiscal 2001, and fiscal 2000. Accordingly, we may have significant exposure in collecting accounts receivable from our wholesale customers and licensees. We have credit policies and procedures which we use to manage our credit risk. We believe that cash from ongoing operations and funds available under our credit facilities and from our Euro offering will be sufficient to satisfy our current level of operations, capital requirements, the stock repurchase program and other corporate activities for the next 12 months. We do not currently intend to pay dividends on our common stock in the next 12 months. SEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY FLUCTUATIONS Our business is affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments to retail customers and key vacation travel and holiday shopping periods in the retail segment. As a result of growth in our retail operations and licensing revenue, historical quarterly operating trends and working capital requirements may not be indicative of future performances. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. Effective December 30, 2001, the Company changed the fiscal year ends of its European subsidiaries as reported in the consolidated financial statements to the Saturday closest to March 31 to conform with the fiscal year end of the Company. Previously, certain of the European subsidiaries were consolidated and reported on the basis of a fiscal year ending December 31. Accordingly, the net activity for the three month period ended December 29, 2001, for the European subsidiaries that were reported on a three month lag is reflected as an adjustment to retained earnings in the accompanying financial statements. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. Certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates. By their nature, these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. These judgments are based on our historical experience, our observations of trends in the industry, information provided by our customers and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Our significant accounting policies include: Revenue Recognition We recognize sales, including sales made to our customers in connection with our shop within shops, upon shipment of products to customers, since title passes upon shipment and, in the case of sales by our retail and outlet stores, when goods are sold to consumers. Allowances for estimated uncollectible accounts, discounts, returns and allowances are provided when sales are recorded based upon historical experience and current trends. We evaluate the adequacy of the allowances quarterly. While such allowances have been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same allowance rate we have in the past. 37 Inventories Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market, cost being determined on the first in, first out method. Reserves for slow moving and aged merchandise are provided based on historical experience and current product demand. We evaluate the adequacy of the reserves quarterly. While such markdowns have been within our expectations and the provisions established, we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same level of markdowns we have in the past. Valuation of Long Lived Assets We assess the carrying value of long lived and intangible assets, including unamortized goodwill, as current facts and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. In evaluating the fair value and future benefits of such assets, we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the individual assets over the remaining amortization period and would recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value exceeded the expected future cash flows. The impairment loss would be measured based upon the difference between the fair value of the asset and its recorded carrying value. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or "FASB," issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or "SFAS," No. 141, Business Combinations and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. In addition to requiring the use of the purchase method for all business combinations, SFAS No. 141 requires intangible assets that meet certain criteria to be recognized as assets apart from goodwill. SFAS No. 142 addresses accounting and reporting standards for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets and generally requires that goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets no longer be amortized but be tested for impairment annually. Intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives. SFAS No. 141 and SFAS No. 142 are effective for our first quarter in the fiscal year ending March 29, 2003, or for any business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001. As a result of these pronouncements, goodwill arising from the acquisitions of PRL Fashions and the Polo Brussels SA store are not being amortized. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting these pronouncements on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. We expect a reduction in amortization expense of approximately $9.0 million for fiscal 2003. In August 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. SFAS No. 143 addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs. This Statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset. SFAS No. 143 is effective for the first quarter in the fiscal year ending April 3, 2004. The Company does not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In October 2001, the FASB issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. This Statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of. SFAS No. 144 supersedes FASB Statement No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed of. However, SFAS No. 144 retains the fundamental provisions of Statement 121 for (a) recognition and measurement of the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and (b) measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale. SFAS No. 144 is effective for the first quarter in the fiscal year ending March 29, 2003. We are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this pronouncement on our consolidated results of operations. In April 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 145, Recission of FASB Statements No. 4, 44, and 64, Amendment of FASB Statement No. 13, and Technical Corrections. In addition to amending and rescinding other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections, 38 clarify meanings, or describe their applicability under changed conditions, SFAS No. 145 precludes companies from recording gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt as an extraordinary item. SFAS No. 145 is effective for our first quarter in the fiscal year ending April 3, 2004. The Company does not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position. In April 2001, the FASBs Emerging Issues Task Force reached a consensus on Issue No. 00 25, Vendor Income Statement Characteristics of Consideration Paid to a Reseller of the Vendors Products. In November 2001, EITF No. 00 25 was codified by the Emerging Issues Task Force in EITF Issue No. 01 09, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to a Customer (Including a Reseller of the Vendors Products). EITF No. 01 09 concluded that consideration from a vendor to a reseller of the vendors products is presumed to be a reduction of the selling prices of the vendors products and, therefore, should be characterized as a reduction of revenue when recognized in the vendors income statement. That presumption is overcome and the consideration characterized as a cost incurred if a benefit is or will be received from the recipient of the consideration if certain conditions are met. The Company adopted this pronouncement in our fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended March 30, 2002, and there was no impact on our consolidated results of operations. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Our policy allows for the use of derivative financial instruments for identifiable market risk exposures, including interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. The following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices and theoretical pricing models obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities. These quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES Foreign currency exposures arise from transactions, including firm commitments and anticipated contracts, denominated in a currency other than an entitys functional currency, and from foreign denominated revenues translated into U.S. dollars. From time to time, we hedge exposures to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with forward foreign exchange contracts. With respect to foreign operations, substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries operate in their respective functional currencies. Our primary foreign currency exposures relate to our Euro debt and Euro investments. The potential loss in value on our Euro debt and Euro investments based on a hypothetical immediate 10.0% adverse change in the Euro rate would have been $20.5 million and $1.7 million at March 30, 2002, as compared to $21.7 million and $4.5 million at March 31, 2001. As of March 30, 2002, a hypothetical immediate 10.0% adverse change in the Euro rate on the Euro debt and Euro investments would have a $1.3 million and $0.1 million unfavorable impact on our earnings and cash flows in fiscal 2003. INTEREST RATES Our primary interest rate exposure relates to our fixed and variable rate debt. The fair value of our fixed Euro debt was $199.6 million based on its quoted market price as listed on the London Stock Exchange and using Euro exchange rates in effect as of March 30, 2002. The potential loss in value at March 30, 2002 on our fixed Euro debt based on a hypothetical immediate 10.0% adverse change in the interest rate would have been $1.3 million. At March 30, 2002, the carrying value of amounts outstanding of $113.0 million under our variable debt 39 borrowing arrangements under our bank credit facilities approximated their fair value. We employ an interest rate hedging strategy utilizing swaps to effectively fix a portion of our interest rate exposure on our floating rate financing arrangements. At March 30, 2002, we had interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of $100.0 million which fixed the interest rate on our variable rate debt at 5.5%. As of March 30, 2002, a hypothetical immediate 10.0% adverse change in interest rates relating to our unhedged portion of our variable rate debt would have a $0.1 million unfavorable impact on our earnings and cash flows in fiscal 2003.
