ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion and analysis is a summary and should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto which are included in this Annual Report. We use a 52 53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest March 31. All references to "2003," "2002" and "2001" represent the 52 week fiscal years ended March 29, 2003, March 30, 2002 and March 31, 2001, respectively. GENERAL We operate in three integrated business operation segments: wholesale, retail and licensing. The following table sets forth net revenues for each business segment for the last three fiscal years. Fiscal 2002 reflects the change in the fiscal year end of certain of our European subsidiaries as reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements. See "Consolidation of European Entities Change in Reporting Period." FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 29, MARCH 30, MARCH 31, 2003 2002 2001 (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) Wholesale sales............................ $1,187,363 $1,198,060 $1,053,842 Retail sales............................... 1,001,958 924,273 928,577 Net sales.................................. 2,189,321 2,122,333 1,982,419 Licensing revenue.......................... 250,019 241,374 243,355 Net revenues............................... $2,439,340 $2,363,707 $2,225,774 Wholesale consists of womens and mens apparel designed and marketed worldwide, which are divided primarily into two groups: Polo Brands and Collection Brands. In both of the wholesale groups, we offer discrete brand offerings, each directed by teams comprising design, merchandising, sales and production staff who work together to conceive, develop and merchandise product groupings organized to convey a variety of design concepts. This segment includes the core business Polo Ralph Lauren, Blue Label, Polo Golf, RLX Polo Sport, Womens Ralph Lauren Collection and Black Label, and Mens Ralph Lauren and Purple Label Collection. Retail consists of our worldwide Polo Ralph Lauren retail operations that sell the product through full price and outlet stores and Club Monaco full price and outlet stores. 27 Our licensing business consists of product, international and home licensing alliances which each pay us royalties based upon its sales of our product subject to a payment of minimum royalty. Product, international and Ralph Lauren Home licensing alliances accounted for 53.5%, 23.7% and 22.8%, respectively, of total licensing revenue in fiscal 2003 and 51.9%, 25.9% and 22.2%, respectively, of total licensing revenue in fiscal 2002. We work closely with our licensing partners to ensure that products are developed, marketed and distributed consistent with the distinctive perspective and lifestyle associated with our brand. As a result of the failure of Jones Apparel Group, including its subsidiaries (Jones), to meet the minimum sales volumes for the year ended December 31, 2002, under the license agreements for the sale of products under the "Ralph" trademark between us and Jones dated May 11, 1998, these license agreements will terminate as of December 31, 2003. We have advised Jones that the termination of these licenses will automatically result in the termination of the licenses between us and Jones with respect to the "Lauren" trademark pursuant to the Cross Default and Term Extension Agreement, between us and Jones dated May 11, 1998. The Lauren license agreements would otherwise expire on December 31, 2006. On June 3, 2003, Jones filed a lawsuit against us in the Supreme Court of the State of New York alleging among other things, that we breached our agreements with Jones with respect to the "Lauren" trademark by asserting our rights pursuant to the Cross Default and Term Extension Agreement and that we induced Ms. Jackwyn Nemerov, the former President of Jones, to breach the non compete and confidentiality clauses in Ms. Nemerovs employment agreement with Jones. Jones has indicated that it will treat the Lauren license agreements as terminated as of December 31, 2003. Jones is seeking compensatory damages of $550.0 million as well as punitive damages and to enforce the provisions of Ms. Nemerovs agreement. If Jones lawsuit were to be determined adversely to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition; however, we believe that the lawsuit is without merit and that we will prevail. Also on June 3, 2003, we filed a lawsuit against Jones in the Supreme Court of the State of New York seeking among other things an injunction and a declaratory judgment that the Lauren license agreements terminate as of December 31, 2003 pursuant to the terms of the Cross Default and Term Extension Agreement. Jones has reported that net sales of Lauren and Ralph products for the year ended December 31, 2002 were $548.0 million and $37.0 million, respectively. The royalties that we received pursuant to the "Lauren" license agreements and "Ralph" license agreements represented revenues in fiscal 2003 of approximately $37.4 million and $5.3 million, respectively. We will no longer receive these royalties after the third quarter of fiscal 2004, as a result of the termination of the Lauren and Ralph license agreements on December 31, 2003. The Company is preparing to begin production and marketing of the Lauren and Ralph lines, with shipments beginning in January 2004. We expect that the income from our sales of Lauren and Ralph products will replace the royalty revenue previously attributable to the Lauren and Ralph license agreements. RECENT ACQUISITIONS In February 2003, we acquired a 50% interest in the Japanese master license for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan. The total purchase price of the interest in the Japanese master license was 2.8 billion Yen, or approximately $24.1 million, based on the average exchange rate in effect on that date. In addition, we acquired an 18% equity interest in the company which holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan for a purchase price of 5.6 billion Yen, or approximately $47.6 million based on the average exchange rate in effect on that date. In May 2003, we acquired an additional 2% equity interest in this company. Unaudited pro forma information related to these acquisitions is not included, as the impact of this transaction is not material to 28 our consolidated results. Please refer to "Note 3 to Consolidated Financial Statements" for a discussion of these acquisitions. We have also acquired six retail locations and related assets in Germany and Argentina from certain of our licensees during the third quarter of fiscal 2003. In October 2001, we acquired PRL Fashions of Europe S.R.L., which holds licenses to sell our womens Ralph Lauren apparel in Europe, as well as our mens and boys Polo Ralph Lauren and our Polo Jeans apparel in Italy, and we acquired the Ralph Lauren store in Brussels from one of our licensees. RESTRUCTURINGS FISCAL 2003 RESTRUCTURING AND SPECIAL CHARGES During the third quarter of fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic review of our European businesses and formalized our plans to centralize and more efficiently consolidate our business operations. The major initiatives of the plan included the following: consolidation of our headquarters from five cities in three countries to one location, the consolidation of our European logistics operations to Italy and the migration of all European information systems to a standard global system. We have completed the consultation process for consolidation of the headquarters and anticipate completion of the consolidation and migration during fiscal 2004. In connection with the implementation of this plan, the Company has recorded a $14.4 million restructuring charge, of which $3.8 million has been paid through March 29, 2003. FISCAL 2001 OPERATIONAL PLAN AND FISCAL 1999 RESTRUCTURING PLAN During fiscal 2001 and 1999 we implemented two plans: the 2001 Operational Plan and the 1999 Restructuring Plan. As of March 29, 2003, we settled all remaining liabilities related to the 1999 Restructuring Plan. In May 2003, we settled $4.6 million of the remaining $5.2 million liabilities related to the 2001 Operational Plan and expect to settle the remaining $0.6 million in fiscal 2004. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The table below sets forth the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain items in our consolidated statements of income for our last three fiscal years: FISCAL YEAR ENDED MARCH 29, MARCH 30, MARCH 31, 2003 2002 2001 Net sales.......................................... 89.8% 89.8% 89.1% Licensing revenue.................................. 10.2 10.2 10.9 Net revenues....................................... 100.0 100.0 100.0 Gross profit....................................... 49.5 48.5 47.8 Selling, general and administrative expenses....... 37.1 35.4 36.9 Restructuring charge............................... 0.6 0.7 5.6 Income from operations............................. 11.8 12.4 5.3 Foreign currency losses (gains).................... (0.1) (0.2) Interest expense................................... 0.6 0.8 1.1 Income before provision for income taxes........... 11.2 11.7 4.4 Provision for income taxes......................... 4.1 4.4 1.7 Net Income......................................... 7.1% 7.3% 2.7% 29 CONSOLIDATION OF EUROPEAN ENTITIES CHANGE IN REPORTING PERIOD Effective December 30, 2001, for reporting purposes the Company changed the fiscal year ends of its European subsidiaries as reported in the consolidated financial statements to the Saturday closest to March 31 to conform with the fiscal year end of the Company. Previously, certain of the European subsidiaries were consolidated and reported on a three month lag with a fiscal year ending December 31. Accordingly, the net activity shown below for the three month period ended December 29, 2001, for those European subsidiaries is reported as an adjustment to retained earnings in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002 in the accompanying financial statements: THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 29, 2001: (DOLLARS IN MILLIONS) Net sales................................................... $49.5 Gross profit................................................ 25.5 Loss before benefit from income taxes....................... (0.7) Benefit from income taxes................................... 0.3 Net loss.................................................... $(0.4) Net income for the year ended March 30, 2002, for the consolidated Company as if the European subsidiaries remained on a three month lag would have been $159.7 million. FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002 NET SALES. Net sales for fiscal 2003 were $2.189 billion, an increase of $67.0 million, or 3.2%, over net sales for fiscal 2002. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year ended March 30, 2002, net sales would have been $2.094 billion resulting in a current fiscal year increase of 4.6%. Wholesale net sales decreased $11.0 million, or 0.9%, to $1.187 billion for fiscal 2003 from $1.198 billion in fiscal 2002. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year ended March 30, 2002, wholesale net sales would have been $1.164 billion and the increase would have been 2.0%. Increases in the European wholesale business of $105.3 million, which resulted primarily from continued European expansion and the inclusion of PRL Fashions operations for the full year, as well as the favorable impact of Euro currency fluctuation, were offset by a strategic streamlining of the amount of product sold to the department stores and the elimination of the womens Ralph Lauren Sport and the Lauren for Men lines which contributed a decrease of $70.2 million. Retail net sales increased $77.7 million, or 8.4%, to $1.002 billion for fiscal 2003 from $924.3 million in fiscal 2002. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year ended March 30, 2002, retail net sales would have been $929.4 million, resulting in a $72.5 million increase. This increase was primarily driven by the $49.4 million, or 8.4%, increase in comparable outlet store sales, which was offset by $7.1 million, or 2.3%, decrease in our total full price stores (comparable store sales information includes both Polo Ralph Lauren stores and Club Monaco stores). The increase also reflected the favorable impact of Euro currency fluctuation. Also impacting this increase is worldwide store expansion. During the year ended March 29, 2003, the Company opened 19 stores, net of closings, ending the period with 255 stores as compared to 236 stores in the prior year, which accounted for approximately $30 million of our increase in net sales. Included in these openings were 11 Polo Ralph Lauren stores, seven Club Monaco stores (including two Club Monaco Caban Home stores), and seven outlet stores (including one full line outlet store, one Polo Jeans outlet store and five European outlet stores). Offsetting these openings were the closings of three outlet stores (including two full line outlet stores and one Polo Jeans outlet store), two Club Monaco stores and one Club Monaco outlet store. 30 LICENSING REVENUE. Licensing revenue increased approximately $8.6 million, or 3.6%, to $250.0 million in fiscal 2003. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year ended March 30, 2002, licensing revenue would have been $237.4 million, resulting in a 5.3%, or $12.6 million, increase primarily driven by increased revenues from our international and product licensing partners of approximately $4.2 million and $8.5 million, respectively. GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit dollars increased $60.8 million, or 5.3%, in fiscal 2003 over fiscal 2002. Gross profits as a percent of net sales increased to 49.5% in 2003 from 48.5% in 2002. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year ended March 30, 2002, gross profit percentage would have been 48.2%. The increase in gross profit rate reflected improved product performance and merchandise margins in the domestic retail businesses, offset by a less than 100 basis point reduction in wholesale. SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased $67.2 million, or 8.0%, to $904.7 million in fiscal 2003 from $837.6 million, as compared to fiscal 2002. These expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 37.1% in 2003 from 35.4% in 2002. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year ended March 30, 2002, SG&A expenses would have been $845.0 million, or 36.3% of net revenues. The increase in fiscal 2003 was primarily higher selling salaries and related costs in connection with the incremental increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion, the expansion of the European wholesale business, the inclusion of PRL Fashions operations, which was acquired in October 2002, as well as the impact of a stronger Eurodollar currency fluctuation. These increases were offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization of $9.1 million as a result of the implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," and the recording of a gain of approximately $5.0 million related to an assignment of the sub lease for one store location. RESTRUCTURING CHARGE. During fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic review of our European businesses and formalized our plans to centralize and more efficiently consolidate our operations. The major initiatives of our plan included the following: consolidation of our headquarters from five cities in three countries to one location; the consolidation of our European logistics operations to Italy; and the migration of all European information systems to a standard global system. We have completed the consultation process for consolidation of the headquarters and anticipate completion of the consolidation and migration during fiscal 2004. In connection with the implementation of this plan, the Company has recorded a $14.4 million restructuring charge, of which $3.8 million has been paid through March 29, 2003. During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded a $16.0 million restructuring charge for lease termination costs associated with the closure of our retail stores due to market factors that were less favorable than originally estimated during the second quarter of fiscal 2001. FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSES (GAINS). The effect of foreign currency decreased to a loss of $0.5 million in fiscal 2003, compared to a $1.8 million gain in fiscal 2002. In fiscal 2003, these losses primarily related to approximately $3.2 million of transaction losses on the unhedged portion of our Euro debt in the first quarter of the fiscal year, which resulted from increases in the Eurodollar rate until we entered into the cross currency swap in June 2002. These losses were partially offset by $2.4 million of gains realized on the Japanese forward contracts, which we further describe in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section. In fiscal 2002, the gains were derived from transaction gains on the unhedged portion of our Euro debt, which resulted from decreases in the Eurodollar rate. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET. Interest expense decreased to $13.5 million in fiscal 2003 from $19.0 million in fiscal 2002. This decrease was primarily due to decreased short term borrowings and long term Euro debt borrowings of $12.0 million and $7.7 million, respectively, during the 31 fiscal year ended March 29, 2003. The remaining decrease of approximately $2.9 million resulted from reduced interest rates as a result of the cross currency swap, which was entered into in connection with our Euro debt in June 2002 and is further described in the "Liquidity and Capital Resources" section. These decreases were partially offset by higher Eurodollar exchange rates, which effect the Euro denominated interest payments on the portion of the Euro debt not covered by the cross currency swap. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. Our tax provision for 2003 was $100.2 million as compared to $103.5 million in 2002, a 36.5% and 37.5% effective tax rate, respectively. This decline is the result of the implementation of tax strategies. NET INCOME. Net income increased in 2003 to $174.2 million from $172.5 million in 2002, or 7.1% and 7.3% of net revenues, respectively. Diluted earnings per common share was $1.76 and $1.75 for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002, respectively. FISCAL 2002 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2001 NET SALES. Net sales increased 7.1% to $2.1 billion in fiscal 2002 from $2.0 billion in fiscal 2001. Wholesale net sales increased 13.7% to $1.2 billion in fiscal 2002 from $1.1 billion in fiscal 2001. Wholesale growth primarily reflects the benefit from the inclusion of two strong quarters for the periods January through March 2002 and 2001 for certain of the European entities. See "Consolidation of European Entities Change in Reporting Period." The impact of consolidating the European subsidiaries on a March 30 fiscal year resulted in an increase in wholesale revenues of approximately $80.0 million, or 7.1%. Retail sales decreased by less than 1.0% to $924.3 million in fiscal 2002 from $928.6 million in fiscal 2001. Our Polo Ralph Lauren full price stores decreased $14.3 million and our Club Monaco stores decreased $8.4 million due to the effects of a promotionally driven and highly competitive retail store environment and the current economic conditions exacerbated by the events of September 11th. Also contributing to the decrease was the closing, in connection with our 2001 Operational Plan, of our Polo Jeans Co. full price retail stores during fiscal 2001, which had sales of $18.0 million during fiscal 2001. These decreases were offset by significant increases in our outlet business of approximately $29.8 million. In fiscal 2002, the impact of consolidating the European subsidiaries on a March 30 fiscal year resulted in a decrease in retail revenues of approximately $3.0 million, less than 1.0%. See "Consolidation of European Entities Change in Reporting Period." Comparable store sales, which represent net sales of stores open in both reporting periods for the full portion of such periods, decreased 3.0%. The comparable store declines were due to the effects of a promotionally driven and highly competitive retail environment. At March 30, 2002, we operated 236 stores: 6 Ralph Lauren stores, 33 Polo Ralph Lauren stores, 55 Club Monaco full price stores, 94 Polo outlet stores, 22 Polo Jeans Co. outlet stores, 16 European outlet stores and 10 Club Monaco outlet stores. LICENSING REVENUE. Licensing revenue decreased approximately $2.0 million, representing less than a 1% decrease, to $241.4 million in fiscal 2002 from $243.4 million in fiscal 2001. Increases from one licensee within our home collection business and from our international licensed business, particularly in Asia, were offset by decreased royalty revenue from a significant product licensee and decreased royalties from our Italian licensee, the business and certain assets of which we acquired in October 2001. In fiscal 2002, the impact of consolidating the European subsidiaries on a March 30 fiscal year increased licensing revenues by approximately $0.4 million, less than 1%. See "Consolidation of European Entities Change in Reporting Period." GROSS PROFIT. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 48.5% in fiscal 2002 from 47.8% in fiscal 2001. This increase was mainly attributable to wholesale gross margins 32 in that $41.5 million of inventory writedowns were recorded in fiscal 2001 in connection with the implementation of our operational review and our decision to accelerate the disposition of aged inventory. In addition, retail gross margins decreased 1.4% due to the effects of a promotionally driven and highly competitive retail store environment, resulting in higher markdowns taken. In fiscal 2002, the impact of consolidating the European subsidiaries on a March 30 fiscal year increased gross profit by approximately $41.0 million, representing less than 4% of total gross profit and less than 0.2 gross percentage points. See "Consolidation of European Entities Change in Reporting Period." SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 35.4% in fiscal 2002 from 36.9% in fiscal 2001. This decrease in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net revenues was primarily due to a charge of $18.1 million recorded in the second quarter of fiscal 2001 relating to nonrecurring charges associated with targeted opportunities for improvement, including the termination of operating contracts, streamlining of certain corporate and operating functions, and employee related matters. In addition, the Company has recorded $2.9 million of gain on the sale of our 50% joint venture interest in a 44,000 square foot building located in the SoHo district of New York City. In fiscal 2002, the impact of consolidating the European subsidiaries on a March 30 fiscal year increased SG&A expenses by approximately $20.0 million, less than 3%. See "Consolidation of European Entities Change in Reporting Period." RESTRUCTURING CHARGE. During fiscal 2002, the Company recorded a $16.0 million restructuring charge for lease termination costs associated with the closure of our retail stores due to market factors that were less favorable than originally estimated during the second quarter of fiscal 2001. During fiscal 2001, the Company recorded a $123.6 million restructuring charge related to our 2001 Operational Plan which included lease and contract termination costs, store fixed asset writedowns and severance and termination benefits. FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSSES (GAINS). The effect of foreign currency decreased to a gain of $1.8 million in fiscal 2002, compared to a $5.8 million gain in fiscal 2001. These gains were derived from transaction gains on the unhedged portion of our Euro debt which resulted from decreases in the Eurodollar rate. INTEREST EXPENSE, NET. Interest expense decreased to $19.0 million in fiscal 2002 from $25.1 million in fiscal 2001. This decrease was due to lower levels of borrowings and the repayment of approximately $53.0 million of short term borrowings during the fiscal year. In addition, we repurchased $10.6 million of our outstanding Euro debt in fiscal 2002. PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. The effective tax rate decreased to 37.5% in fiscal 2002 from 39.5% in fiscal 2001, resulting from the implementation of tax strategies. NET INCOME. Net income increased in fiscal 2002 to $172.5 million from $59.3 million in fiscal 2001, or 7.3% and 2.7% of net revenues, respectively. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund growth in working capital (primarily accounts receivable and inventory) to support projected sales increases, construction and renovation of shop within shops, investment in the technological upgrading of our distribution centers and information systems, expenditures related to retail store expansion, acquisitions and other corporate activities, including financing the start up costs of bringing the "Lauren" and "Ralph" lines in house. Sources of liquidity to fund ongoing and future cash requirements include cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, credit facilities and other borrowings. We ended fiscal 2003 with $343.6 million in cash and cash equivalents and $349.4 million of debt outstanding compared to $244.7 million and $318.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and debt outstanding, respectively, at March 30, 2002. This represents a $67.8 million improvement in 33 our debt net of cash position over the last twelve months which is primarily attributable to the differences in working capital due to the factors discussed below, partially offset by approximately $73.0 million of purchase price payments connected with our acquisition to acquire a 50% interest in the Japanese master license and an 18% equity interest in the company which holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan. Capital expenditures were $98.7 million for fiscal 2003, compared to $88.0 million in fiscal 2002. Also, in the past year, we have acquired several retail locations from certain of our licensees in Belgium, Germany and Argentina for a total purchase price of approximately $4.6 million. As of March 29, 2003, we had $100.9 million outstanding in short term bank borrowings, of which $50.0 million was repaid in April 2003 with the remainder anticipated to be repaid in June 2003. Additionally, we had $248.5 million outstanding in long term Euro debt based on the quarter end Euro exchange rate. We were also contingently liable for $19.1 million in outstanding letters of credit primarily related to commitments for the purchase of inventory. The weighted average interest rate on our borrowings at March 29, 2003 was 5.4%. Accounts receivable increased to $375.8 million, or 6.3% at March 29, 2003 compared to $353.6 million at March 30, 2002 due to the timing of shipments. The increase also reflected the favorable impact of Euro currency fluctuation. Improvements were made in our days sales outstanding; however, the incremental effect of these improvements was offset by the additional royalty receivables recorded in fiscal 2003 compared to fiscal 2002. Inventories increased $14.0 million, or 4.0%, at the end of 2003 compared to the end of 2002. This increase reflects the build up of certain inventory for European retail stores as part of our continued expansion. The increase also reflected the favorable impact of Euro currency fluctuation. In addition, improvements in the management of the Companys supply chain resulting in better forecasting and distribution have resulted in increased average inventory turnover rates for the year ended March 29, 2003 as compared to the same period in fiscal 2002. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $269.0 million during 2003 compared to $299.7 million in 2002. This $30.7 million decrease in cash flow was driven primarily by year over year changes in accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and accounts payable. During fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic review of our European businesses and formalized our plans to centralize and more efficiently consolidate its business operations. In connection with the implementation of this plan, we recorded a restructuring charge of $14.4 million and had total cash outlays of approximately $3.8 million during the year ended March 29, 2003. It is expected that the remaining liabilities will be paid throughout fiscal 2004. During fiscal 2001 and 1999 we implemented two plans: the 2001 Operational Plan and 1999 Restructuring Plan. Total cash outlays related to the 2001 Operational Plan and 1999 Restructuring Plan were $9.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively, for the year ended March 29, 2003. As of March 29, 2003, we settled all remaining liabilities related to the 1999 Restructuring Plan. In May 2003, we settled $4.6 million of the remaining $5.2 million liabilities related to the 2001 Operational Plan and expect to settle the remaining $0.6 million in fiscal 2004. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased to $166.3 million in fiscal 2003, as compared to $116.0 million in fiscal 2002. Both the fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 net cash used primarily reflected shop within shops and other capital expenditures related to retail expansion and upgrading our systems and facilities. Our anticipated capital expenditures for fiscal 2004 approximate $110.0 million. The fiscal 2003 net cash used also reflects $78.0 million primarily for our acquisition to acquire a 50% interest in the Japanese master license and an 18% equity interest in the company which holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan, whereas the fiscal 2002 net cash used reflects $23.7 million for the acquisition of PRL Fashions. 34 Also, in the past year, we have acquired several retail locations from certain of our licensees in Belgium, Germany and Argentina for a total purchase price of approximately $4.6 million. Consistent with SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations," the acquisition of the 50% interest in the Japanese master license and the several retail locations were accounted for under purchase accounting. In connection with the acquisition of the Japanese master license, the Company recorded tangible assets of $11.0 million, an intangible license valued at $9.9 million and liabilities assumed of $8.5 million based on estimated fair values as determined by management utilizing information available at this time. Goodwill of $13.0 million was recognized for the excess of the purchase price over the preliminary estimate of fair market value of the net assets acquired. In connection with the purchase accounting for the remaining acquisitions, the Company is in the process of evaluating the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed. At March 29, 2003, the Companys accounting for the fiscal 2003 acquisitions was based on preliminary valuation information, which is subject to revision. The sales and total assets related to the acquired entities were not material. The pro forma effect of these acquisitions on the historical results was not material. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $16.7 million in fiscal 2003, compared to $40.3 million in fiscal 2002. This change is primarily due to the net repayment of short term debt of $12.0 million, the repurchase of $7.7 million of our Euro debt and the repurchase of our common stock of $4.7 million, offset by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $7.7 million for fiscal 2003; compared to $52.2 million of short term debt repayment, $10.6 million of Euro debt repurchases, $2.1 million of common stock repurchases offset by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $24.5 million in fiscal 2002. In March 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, subject to market conditions, of up to $100.0 million of our Class A common stock. Share repurchases were to be made in the open market over a two year period, which commenced April 1, 1998. The Board of Directors has extended the stock repurchase program through March 31, 2004. Shares acquired under the repurchase program will be used for stock option programs and for other corporate purposes. As of March 29, 2003, we had repurchased 4,105,932 shares of our Class A common stock at an aggregate cost of $77.9 million. As of March 29, 2003, we had approximately $22.1 million remaining in our stock repurchase program. In November 1999, we issued Euro 275.0 million of 6.125% notes due November 2006. Our Euro debt is listed on the London Stock Exchange. The net proceeds from the Euro offering were $281.5 million, based on the Euro exchange rate on the issuance date. Interest on the Euro debt is payable annually. A portion of these net proceeds was used to acquire Poloco S.A.S. and the remaining net proceeds were retained for general corporate purposes. In fiscal 2003, we repurchased Euro 8.4 million, or $7.7 million, based on Euro exchange rates at the time of repurchase, of our outstanding Euro debt. In November 2002, we terminated both our 1997 bank credit facility and our 1999 senior bank credit facility and entered into a new credit facility. The 1997 bank credit facility provided for a $225.0 million revolving line of credit and matured on December 31, 2002, while the 1999 senior bank credit facility consisted of a $20.0 million revolving line of credit and an $80.0 million term loan, both of which were scheduled to mature on June 30, 2003. The new credit facility is with a syndicate of banks and consists of a $300.0 million revolving line of credit, subject to increase to $375.0 million, which is available for direct borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit. It will mature on November 18, 2005. As of March 29, 2003, we had $100.0 million outstanding under the new facility, which was the aggregate amount outstanding under the old facilities at the time of extinguishment, $50.0 million of which was repaid in April 2003 and the remaining $50.0 million is expected to be repaid in June 2003. Borrowings under this facility bear interest, at our option, 35 at a rate equal to (i) the higher of the Federal Funds Effective Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 1/2 of one percent, and the prime commercial lending rate of JP Morgan Chase Bank in effect from time to time, or (ii) the LIBO Rate (as defined) in effect from time to time, as adjusted for the Federal Reserve Boards Eurocurrency Liabilities maximum reserve percentages, and a margin based on our then current credit ratings. As of March 29, 2003, the margin was 0.75%. Our 2002 bank credit facility requires that we maintain certain covenants: a minimum consolidated tangible net worth, and a maximum of Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR (as such terms are defined in the credit facility) ratio. The credit facility also contains covenants that, subject to specified exceptions, restrict our ability to: incur additional debt; incur liens and contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of our assets, including equity interests; merge with or acquire other companies, liquidate or dissolve; engage in businesses that are not a related line of business; make loans, advances or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make investments. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the credit facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The credit facility specifies a number of events of default, many of which are subject to applicable grace or cure periods, including, among others, the failure to make timely principal and interest payments, to satisfy the covenants, or to maintain the required financial performance requirements described above. Additionally, the agreement provides that an event of default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren and related entities fail to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power of our common stock. As of March 29, 2003, the Company was in compliance with all financial and non financial debt covenants. On May 20, 2003, the Board of Directors declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.05 per share, or $0.20 per share on an annual basis, on Polo Ralph Lauren common stock. The dividend is payable to shareholders of record at the close of business on June 27, 2003 and will be paid on July 11, 2003. We believe that cash from ongoing operations and funds available under our credit facility and from our initial Euro debt offering will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations, capital requirements, the stock repurchase program, cash dividends and other corporate activities for the next twelve months. In January 2003, the Company completed the assignment of the sub lease for one store location for which the Company received proceeds of approximately $10.0 million and recorded a gain of approximately $5.0 million in the fourth quarter ended March 29, 2003. 36 The following table summarizes as of March 29, 2003, the Companys contractual cash obligations by future periods: LESS THAN 1 YEAR 1 3 YEARS 4 5 YEARS THEREAFTER TOTAL (DOLLARS IN THOUSANDS) Short term borrowings............... $100,943 $100,943 Long term Euro debt................. $248,494 248,494 Capitalized leases.................. 1,806 $ 3,916 5,722 Operating leases.................... 72,654 136,921 114,925 238,052 562,552 Additional acquisition purchase price payments.................... 4,500 7,000 11,500 Total............................... $179,903 $147,837 $363,419 $238,052 $929,211 Derivative Instruments. In June 2002, we entered into a cross currency rate swap, which terminates in November 2006. The cross currency rate swap is being used to convert Euro 105.2 million, 6.125% fixed rate borrowings into $100.0 million, LIBOR plus 1.24% variable rate borrowings. We entered into the cross currency rate swap to minimize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations in both principal and interest payments resulting from the Euro debt, and to minimize the impact of changes in the fair value of the Euro debt due to changes in LIBOR, the benchmark interest rate. The swap has been designated as a fair value hedge under SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended and interpreted. Hedge ineffectiveness is measured as the difference between the respective gains or losses recognized in earnings from the changes in the fair value of the cross currency rate swap and the Euro debt; and was de minimis for fiscal 2003. Occasionally, we purchase short term foreign currency contracts as hedges relating to identifiable currency positions to reduce our risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases or to neutralize month end balance sheet and other expected exposures. To the extent that these derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, they are recorded at fair value, with all gains or losses recognized immediately in the current period earnings. In November 2002, we entered into forward contracts on 6.2 billion Japanese Yen that terminated in February 2003. While these transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, we entered into these forward contracts to minimize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the Japanese Yen denominated purchase price described in the agreements related to the purchase of a 50% interest in the Japanese master license and an 18% equity interest in the company which holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan, which were consummated during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. We recognized $2.4 million of foreign currency gains on this transaction, which are recorded in foreign currency losses(gains) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We recognize foreign currency gains or losses in connection with our Euro debt and certain short term foreign currency contracts based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. In connection with recording these contracts at fair market value, we recognized $3.2 million in foreign currency losses in fiscal 2003, and $1.8 million in fiscal 2002, included as a component of foreign currency losses (gains) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. The Company does not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or unconsolidated special purpose entities. SEASONALITY OF BUSINESS Our business is affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments to retail customers and key 37 vacation travel and holiday shopping periods in the retail segment. As a result of the growth in our retail operations and licensing revenue, historical quarterly operating trends and working capital requirements may not be indicative of future performances. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. Fiscal 2002 reflects the change in the fiscal year end of certain of our European subsidiaries as reported in our consolidated financial statements. See "Consolidation of European Entities Change in Reporting Period." In connection with our acquisition of a 50% interest in the Japanese master license and the 18% equity interest in the company which holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan, results for these operations will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements for the three months ended June 28, 2003. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates by their nature are based on judgments and available information and therefore, actual results could differ from those estimates. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and the results of operations, and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments, as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Companys most critical accounting policies, discussed below, pertain to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill, other intangibles and long lived assets. In applying such policies, management must use some amounts that are based upon its informed judgments and best estimates. Because of the uncertainty inherent in these estimates, actual results could differ from estimates used in applying the critical accounting policies. Changes in such estimates, based on more accurate future information, may affect amounts reported in future periods. The Company is not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances which would result in different amounts being reported that would materially affect its financial condition or results of operations. REVENUE RECOGNITION Wholesale sales are recognized upon shipment of products to customers since title and risk of loss passes upon shipment and are recorded net of returns, discounts and allowances. Returns and allowances require pre approval from management. Estimates for end of season allowances are based on historic trends, seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic conditions and retailer performance. The Companys historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. Sales by our retail and outlet stores are recognized when goods are sold to consumers, net of returns. Licensing revenue is recognized based upon shipment of licensed products sold by our licensees, net of allowances. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET In the normal course of business, the Company extends credit to customers, which satisfy pre defined credit criteria. Accounts receivable, net, as shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is net of allowances and anticipated discounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements, assessments of collectibility based on historic trends and an evaluation of the economic conditions. Costs associated with potential returns of products as well as allowable 38 customer markdowns and operational chargebacks, net of the expected recoveries, are included as a reduction to net sales and are part of the provision for allowances included in accounts receivable, net. These provisions result from divisional seasonal negotiations, as well as historic deduction trends net of expected recoveries, and the evaluation of current market conditions. The Companys historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. INVENTORIES Inventories are valued at the lower of cost (first in, first out, FIFO, method), or market. The Company continually evaluates the composition of its inventories assessing slow turning, ongoing product as well as prior seasons fashion product. Estimates may differ from actual results due to quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions. The Companys historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLES AND LONG LIVED ASSETS Effective March 31, 2002, the Company adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 142. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer are to be amortized, but rather be tested at least annually for impairment. This pronouncement also requires that intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their respective lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." Goodwill represents the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Before adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 142, we amortized goodwill on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, ranging from 11 to 40 years. Beginning in fiscal 2003, consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 142, we no longer amortize goodwill. The Company reviews goodwill annually for impairment. In addition, trademarks that are owned that have been deemed to have indefinite lives are reviewed at least annually for potential value impairment. Trademarks that are licensed by the Company from third parties are amortized over the individual terms of the respective license agreement, which approximates 10 years. Goodwill amortization expense was $9.1 million and $8.0 million in fiscal 2002 and 2001, respectively. Accumulated goodwill amortization was $23.7 million at March 30, 2002. We assess the carrying value of long lived and intangible assets, with finite lives, as current facts and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. In evaluating the fair value and future benefits of such assets, we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the individual assets over the remaining amortization period and would recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value exceeded the expected future cash flows. The impairment loss would be measured based upon the difference between the fair value of the asset and its recorded carrying value. See Note 9 for long lived and intangible asset writedowns recorded in connection with our fiscal 2001 Operational Plan and fiscal 1999 Restructuring Plan. During fiscal 2003, there were no material impairment losses recorded in connection with this analysis. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to Our Consolidated Financial Statements. ALTERNATIVE ACCOUNTING METHODS In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Companys significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options and inventories. 39 Two alternative methods for accounting for stock options are available, the intrinsic value method and the fair value method. The Company uses the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options, and accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized. Under the fair value method, the determination of the pro forma amounts involves several assumptions including option life and future volatility. If the fair value method were used, diluted earnings per share for 2003 would decrease approximately 10%. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Two alternative methods for accounting for inventories are the FIFO method and the last in, first out (LIFO) method. The Company accounts for all inventories under the FIFO method. Two alternative methods for accounting for retail inventories are the retail method and the cost method. The Company accounts for all retail inventories under the cost method. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity." This statement requires that certain financial instruments that, under previous guidance, issuers could account for as equity be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position. Most of the guidance in SFAS No. 150 is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The Company does not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial position. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, "Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities." This statement amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, except as for the provisions that relate to SFAS No. 133 implementation issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to June 15, 2003, which should continue to be applied in accordance with their respective effective dates. The Company does not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial position. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure." This statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements for SFAS No. 123, "Accounting for Stock Based Compensation," to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation. SFAS No. 148 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2002. The Company does not intend to expense stock options; therefore the adoption of this statement did not have any impact on the consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." This statement required companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs covered by SFAS No. 146 include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing, or exit or disposal activity. SFAS No. 146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 146. 40 In January 2003, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." A variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. Historically, entities generally were not consolidated unless the entity was controlled through voting interests. FIN 46 changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the "primary beneficiary" of that entity. FIN 46 also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46 apply to existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. Also, certain disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. The Company is currently evaluating the provisions of the interpretation and does not expect any material impact to the financial statements as a result of adopting this interpretation. In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN 45, "Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others." FIN 45 requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value and requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures, even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote. Generally, FIN 45 applies to certain types of financial guarantees that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying that is related to an asset, liability or an equity security of the guaranteed party; performance guarantees involving contracts which require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entitys failure to perform under an obligating agreement; indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to an indemnified party based on changes in an underlying that is related to an asset, liability or an equity security of the indemnified party; or indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Disclosure requirements under FIN 45 are effective for financial statements ending after December 15, 2002, and are applicable to all guarantees issued by the guarantor subject to FIN 45s scope, including guarantees issued prior to FIN 45. The Company adopted the accounting and disclosure provisions of FIN 45 in its March 29, 2003 financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Our policy allows for the use of derivative financial instruments for identifiable market risk exposures, including interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. During fiscal 2003, there were significant fluctuations in the value of the Euro dollar exchange rate. In June 2002, we entered into a cross currency rate swap to minimize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the long term Euro debt and the impact of fluctuations in the interest rate on the fair value of the long term Euro debt. The following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices and theoretical pricing models obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration 41 the underlying terms and maturities. These quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We have assets and liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies related to international subsidiaries. At March 29, 2003, we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts in Europe to purchase $92.5 million U.S. dollars through March 2004. We believe that these financial instruments should not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should offset losses and gains on the assets, liabilities, and transactions being hedged. We are exposed to credit related losses if the counterparty to the financial instruments fails to perform its obligations. However, we do not expect the counterparty, which presently has high credit ratings, to fail to meet its obligations. Our primary foreign currency exposure relates to our Euro debt. As of March 29, 2003, the fair value of our fixed Euro debt was $252.4 million, based on its quoted market price as listed on the London Stock exchange and translated using Euro exchange rates in effect as of March 29, 2003. The potential increase in fair value of our fixed rate Euro debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in exchange rates would have been approximately $27.2 million at March 29, 2003. As of March 29, 2003, a hypothetical immediate 10% adverse change in exchange rates would have had a $1.7 million unfavorable impact over a one year period on our earnings and cash flows. We employ a cross currency fair value hedging strategy utilizing swaps to effectively convert a portion of our Euro denominated debt into USD denominated debt. For further information, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. INTEREST RATES Our primary interest rate exposure relates to our fixed and variable rate debt. The potential increase in fair value of our fixed rate Euro debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates would have been approximately $3.7 million at March 29, 2003. We employ a fair value cross currency hedging strategy utilizing swaps to effectively float a portion of our interest rate exposure on our fixed rate Euro debt. The primary interest rate exposure on floating rate financing arrangements are with respect to the United States. We had approximately $100.9 million in variable rate financing arrangements at March 29, 2003. As of March 29, 2003, a hypothetical immediate 10% adverse change in interest rates, as they relate to the maximum available borrowings under our variable rate financial instruments, would have a $0.9 million unfavorable impact over a one year period on our earnings and cash flows. We employ an interest rate hedging strategy utilizing swaps to effectively fix substantially all of our interest rate exposure on our outstanding variable rate debt. For further information, see Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.
