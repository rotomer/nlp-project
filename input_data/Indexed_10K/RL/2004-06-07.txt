Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis is a summary and should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We use a 52 53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest March 31. All references to Fiscal 2004 represent the 53 week fiscal year ended April 3, 2004, while references to Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 represent the 52 week fiscal years ended March 29, 2003 and March 30, 2002, respectively. Overview We operate in three integrated business operation segments: wholesale, retail and licensing. Wholesale consists of womens and mens apparel designed and marketed worldwide, which are divided primarily into three groups: Polo Brands, Lauren and Collection Brands. In each of the wholesale groups, we offer discrete brand offerings, directed by teams comprising design, merchandising, sales and production staff who work together to conceive, develop and merchandise product groupings organized to convey a variety of design concepts. This segment includes the core business Polo Ralph Lauren as well as Lauren, Blue Label, Polo Golf, RLX Polo Sport, Womens Ralph Lauren Collection and Black Label, and Mens Purple Label Collection. Retail consists of our worldwide Ralph Lauren retail operations that sell the product through full price and outlet stores and Club Monaco full price and outlet stores. Licensing consists of product, international and home licensing alliances, each of which pay us royalties based upon sales of our product, and are generally subject to minimum royalty payments. We work closely with our licensing partners to ensure that products are developed, marketed and distributed in a manner consistent with the distinctive perspective and lifestyle associated with our brand. Fiscal 2004 Overall Results During Fiscal 2004, overall revenue increased $210.3 million or 8.6% primarily as a result of strong growth in our retail business and the introduction of the Lauren line in our Wholesale business, partially offset primarily by planned sales declines in our Mens Wholesale business due to a reduction in off price sales. Our licensing revenue increased $18.8 million or 7.5% as a result of growth in the footwear business, as well as the incremental effect of the consolidation 30 Table of Contents of revenues from the Japanese master license, partially offset by the loss of licensing income from the Lauren label, previously operated by Jones Apparel Group, Inc. The inclusion of the 53rd week was responsible for an estimated $39.5 million of the sales increase. Gross profit increased $115.7 million or 9.6% and our gross margin as a percentage of sales (gross margin rate) increased to 49.9% from 49.5% in the prior year. The increasing gross profit rate reflects the benefits of advertising, improved product mix and targeted marketing as well as a continued focus on inventory management. Operating expenses increased $125.2 million or 13.8% primarily as a result of start up expenses associated with the Lauren line and the increased operating expenses associated with our growth in retail sales. During Fiscal 2004, we recorded restructuring charges of $19.6 million. These charges are composed of an additional $10.4 million for lease termination costs associated primarily with two Club Monaco retail properties included in our 2001 operational plan due to real estate market factors that were less favorable than originally estimated, $7.9 million for additional contract termination and severance costs related to the consolidation of our European business operations and $1.3 million related to our decision to close the RRL stores. Our international operating results were affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. However, the increase in net sales due to the strengthening Euro and Canadian dollar was generally offset by a comparable increase in cost of sales and operating expenses. Balance Sheet Our financial position remains strong. Although our cash and cash equivalents decreased $0.1 million, our cash and cash equivalents net of debt position improved $72.0 million. Cash flow from operations decreased by $59.9 million primarily as a result of increases in inventory and accounts receivable associated with the start up of the Lauren line. The strengthening of the Euro has had a significant effect on certain of our balance sheet accounts including Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Accounts Payable and Long Term Debt. Recent Developments On May 25, 2004, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain of the assets and to assume certain of the liabilities of RL Childrenswear Company, LLC relating to the Childrenswear Licensees licensed childrenswear apparel business in the United States, Canada and Mexico (the Childrenswear Business). The purchase price for the acquisition of the Childrenswear Business will be $232.1 million in cash payable at closing, subject to a working capital adjustment, plus up to an additional $20 million of deferred and contingent cash payments. Payment of the purchase price will be funded by cash on hand and lines of credit as required. In addition, the Company will assume certain ordinary course trade payables and accrued expenses of the Childrenswear Licensee and accrued vacation obligations for the Childrenswear Licensees employees who will become employees of the Company following the closing of the acquisition. The assets of the Childrenswear Licensee being acquired by the Company include, among other things, the license; all inventories of the Childrenswear Licensee; certain leases; customer lists; supplier lists; and books and records. The Childrenswear Licensee and certain of its affiliates and shareholders have agreed to indemnify the Company for all of the liabilities of the Company related to the operation of the Business prior to the closing of the acquisition and have also agreed that they will not compete with the Business for a period of three years after the closing date. In addition, the Childrenswear Licensee and certain of its affiliates will provide information system and accounting services to the Company for a transitional period following the closing. 31 Table of Contents The closing of the proposed transaction is subject to customary conditions, including the receipt of certain third party consents and the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The closing of the transaction is anticipated to occur in late June 2004. Our licensing arrangements with Jones Apparel Group, Inc. (Jones) relating to the Lauren and Ralph lines ended on December 31, 2003 and we have begun designing, marketing and selling the Lauren line as part of our wholesale business. As discussed in Item 1 Business Recent Developments and Item 3 Legal Proceedings, we are currently in litigation with Jones over the termination of the Lauren licenses. If the Jones litigation were to be determined adversely to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. However, we intend to continue to defend the case vigorously and believe our position is correct on the merits. The royalties that we received pursuant to the Lauren license agreements and Ralph license agreements represented revenues of approximately $23.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively, in Fiscal 2004 prior to the termination of these licenses on December 31, 2003 and $37.4 million and $5.3 million respectively during Fiscal 2003. We expect that the income from our sales of Lauren products will at least replace the royalty income previously attributable to the Lauren and Ralph license agreements for Fiscal 2005. In total, royalties received from Jones, including royalties from the Polo Jeans license agreements, accounted for 17.2% and 27.2% of our aggregate licensing revenue for Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003 respectively. Our Polo Jeans license agreements with Jones continue in effect. In June 2003, one of our licensing partners, WestPoint Stevens, Inc., and certain of its affiliates (WestPoint) filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. WestPoint produces bedding and bath product in our Home Collection. On December 19, 2003, the United States Bankruptcy Court approved an amended licensing agreement between WestPoint and us, which provides for the same royalty rate and minimum royalties that are not materially lower than under the previous agreement. Recent Acquisitions In February 2003, we acquired a 50% controlling interest in the Japanese master license for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan. All of the revenues and expenses for the Japanese master license are included in our consolidated statements of operations, and we record minority interest expense to reflect the share of earnings or losses allocable to the 50% minority interest holder in the Japanese master license. These amounts are included in Other (income) expense, net, in the consolidated statements of operations. We recorded minority interest expense of $1.4 million for the year ended April 3, 2004. Also, in February 2003, we acquired an 18% equity interest in the company that holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan. In May 2003, we acquired an additional 2% equity interest in this company. For the year ended April 3, 2004, we recorded $5.5 million of equity investment income related to this 20% investment in Other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. Results for our 50% interest in the Japanese master license and the 20% equity interest in the holder of the Japanese sublicenses are reported on a one month lag. Restructurings During Fiscal 2004, we determined that the two remaining RRL stores would be closed. In connection with this decision we recorded a $1.3 million restructuring charge for lease termination costs and fixed asset impairments. 32 Table of Contents During Fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic review of our European businesses and formalized our plans to centralize and more efficiently consolidate our business operations. The major initiatives of the plan included the following: consolidation of our headquarters from five cities in three countries to one location, the consolidation of our European logistics operations to Italy and the migration of all European information systems to a standard global system. In connection with the implementation of this plan, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $7.9 million during Fiscal 2004 and a $14.4 million charge during Fiscal 2003, of which $17.1 million had been paid through April 3, 2004. It is expected that this plan will be completed and the remaining liabilities will be paid in Fiscal 2005. During Fiscal 2001, we implemented the 2001 Operational Plan. Due to real estate market factors that were less favorable than originally estimated, we recorded an additional $10.4 million charge during Fiscal 2004. We expect to settle the remaining liabilities in Fiscal 2005 or in accordance with contract terms. Results of Operations The table below sets forth results in millions of dollars and the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain items in our consolidated statements of income for our last three fiscal years: Fiscal Year Ended April 3, March 29, March 30, April 3, March 29, March 30, 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 Net sales $ 2,380.9 $ 2,189.3 $ 2,122.3 90.0 % 89.8 % 89.8 % Licensing revenue 268.8 250.0 241.4 10.0 % 10.2 % 10.2 % Net revenues 2,649.7 2,439.3 2,363.7 100 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross profit 1,323.3 1,207.6 1,146.8 49.9 % 49.5 % 48.5 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,030.0 904.8 837.6 38.9 % 37.1 % 35.4 % Restructuring charge 19.5 14.4 16.0 0.7 % 0.6 % 0.7 % Income from operations 273.8 288.4 293.2 10.3 % 11.8 % 12.4 % Foreign currency losses (gains) 1.9 0.5 (1.8 ) (0.1 )% Interest expense 10.0 13.5 19.0 0.4 % 0.6 % 0.8 % Income before provision for income taxes and other (income) expense, net 261.9 274.4 276.0 9.9 % 11.2 % 11.7 % Provision for income taxes 95.0 100.2 103.5 3.6 % 4.1 % 4.4 % Other (income) expense, net (4.1 ) (0.2 )% Net income $ 171.0 $ 174.2 $ 172.5 6.5 % 7.1 % 7.3 % Consolidation of European Entities Change in Reporting Period Effective December 30, 2001, for reporting purposes, the Company changed the fiscal year ends of its European subsidiaries as reported in the consolidated financial statements to the Saturday closest to March 31 to conform with the fiscal year end of the Company. Previously, certain of the European subsidiaries were consolidated and reported on a three month lag with a fiscal year ending December 31. Accordingly, the net activity shown below for the three month period ended December 29, 2001, for those European subsidiaries is reported as an adjustment 33 Table of Contents to retained earnings in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2002 in the accompanying financial statements: Three months Ended December 29, 2001: (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 49.5 Gross profit 25.5 Loss before benefit from income taxes (0.7 ) Benefit from income taxes 0.3 Net loss $ (0.4 ) Net income for the year ended March 30, 2002, for the consolidated Company if the European subsidiaries remained on a three month lag would have been $159.7 million. Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 Net Revenues. Net revenues for Fiscal 2004 were $2.650 billion, an increase of $210.3 million over net revenues for Fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to increases in our retail segment as a result of our improved comparable retail store sales, continued store expansion and the favorable impact of the strengthening Euro and Canadian dollar. Also contributing to the sales increase was the 53rd week in Fiscal 2004 compared to 52 weeks in Fiscal 2003. The 53rd week was responsible for an estimated $39.5 million of the sales increase. Further influencing the increase in net revenues were overall increases in licensing revenues driven by the incremental effect of the consolidation of revenues from the Japanese master license and improved results in the footwear business. Additionally, wholesale revenues increased as a result of the sale of Lauren products commencing in the third quarter of fiscal year 2004. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales in our wholesale business primarily driven by planned reductions in off price sales in our mens, womens and European business as well as the loss of the Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones. Net revenues for our business segments are provided below (Dollars in thousands). Fiscal Year Ended April 3, March 29, Increase 2004 2003 (Decrease) % Change Net revenues: Wholesale $ 1,210,397 $ 1,187,363 $ 23,034 1.9 % Retail 1,170,447 1,001,958 168,489 16.8 % Licensing 268,810 250,019 18,791 7.5 % Total Net Revenue $ 2,649,654 $ 2,439,340 $ 210,314 8.6 % Wholesale net sales increased primarily due to the addition of the Lauren line, which accounted for net sales of approximately $109.8 million in the current year partially offset by: a $60.4 million decrease in the domestic mens wholesale business, which resulted from a planned reduction in off price sales and a reduction in spring sales due to a planned reduction of sales to lower margin customers. the elimination of the womens Ralph Lauren Sport line, which accounted for net sales of approximately $12.3 million in the prior year. decreases in the European wholesale business, primarily due to the soft economic conditions in Europe, of approximately $65.4 million on a constant dollar basis, offset by a $45.1 million favorable impact due to a stronger Euro in the current period. 34 Table of Contents Retail net sales increased primarily as a result of: a $43.7 million, or 14.4%, increase in comparable full price store sales and a $48.8 million, or 7.6%, increase in comparable outlet store sales on a constant dollar basis. Excluding the extra week in Fiscal 2004, comparable store sales increased 12.2% and 5.7% in full price and outlet stores, respectively, on a constant dollar basis. Comparable store sales for the 53 weeks increased 18.0% and 8.8% for the full price stores and the outlet stores, respectively, while comparable store sales on a on a 52 week basis increased 15.8% for full price stores and 6.9% for outlet stores. Comparable store sales information includes both Ralph Lauren stores and Club Monaco stores. worldwide store expansion. During Fiscal 2004, the Company added 15 stores and closed 7 stores. Our total store count at April 3, 2004 was 263 stores compared to 255 stores at March 29, 2003. the stronger Euro and Canadian dollar in the current period, accounted for approximately $27.0 million of the increase in net sales. Licensing revenue increased primarily as a result of: a $27.5 million increase in international licensing primarily due to the incremental effect of the consolidation of revenues from the Japanese master license. $3.5 million increase in domestic licensing due to improvements in the footwear business. partially offset by the loss of $15.8 million of Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones compared to the prior year. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased $115.7 million, or 9.6%, for Fiscal 2004 compared to Fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of the increases discussed above. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 49.9% from 49.5%. This increase reflects a change in business mix, with retail sales representing 44.2% of revenues in Fiscal 2004 compared to 41.1% in Fiscal 2003 and improved margins in our Ralph Lauren and Club Monaco retail stores. The increasing gross profit rate also reflects higher realized sales dollars resulting from a combination of improved product mix as well as the benefits of advertising and targeted marketing. The rate improvement also reflects a continued focus on inventory management. Although our inventory balance at April 3, 2004 is approximately the same as it was at March 29, 2003, this primarily reflects the appreciation of the Euro, inventories related to our Lauren wholesale business and increased levels of inventory related to our retail growth offset by decreases in inventory in other lines of business. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A increased $125.2 million, or 13.8%, to $1.030 billion during Fiscal 2004 from $904.8 million during Fiscal 2003. SG&A as a percent of net revenues increased to 38.9% from 37.1%. The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by: Higher selling salaries and related costs of $43.4 million, exclusive of the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in connection with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion. Approximately $30.4 million of the increase in SG&A was due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the Euro and Canadian dollar in Fiscal 2004. Expenses of $28.1 million associated with the Lauren wholesale business, exclusive of additional corporate and overhead expenses incurred and reduced royalty revenues received. 35 Table of Contents $19.0 million of increased international licensing SG&A primarily due to the consolidation of incremental expenses in connection with the Japanese master license. Restructuring Charge. We recorded restructuring charges of $19.6 million during Fiscal 2004 compared to restructuring charges of $14.4 million during Fiscal 2003. The Fiscal 2004 restructuring charge is comprised of an additional $10.4 million for lease termination costs primarily associated with two Club Monaco retail properties included in our 2001 Operational Plan due to real estate market factors that were less favorable than originally estimated, $7.9 million for additional contract termination and severance costs related to the consolidation of our European business operations (approximately $6.7 million for the wholesale business and $1.2 million for the retail business) and $1.3 million for lease termination and asset write offs associated with the March 2004 decision to close our RRL stores. The Fiscal 2003 restructuring charge of $14.4 million related to severance and contract termination costs in connection with the consolidation of our European business operations. Income (Loss) from Operations. Income from operations decreased $14.6 million, or 5.1%, in Fiscal 2004 compared to Fiscal 2003. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in wholesale operating profits, restructuring charges, the decrease in Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones following the license termination in December 2003 and the start up expenses associated with the Lauren line. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the retail segments profits. Income from operations was not significantly impacted by the stronger Euro and Canadian dollar period because the increased sales resulting from exchange rate fluctuations were substantially offset by a comparable increase in expenses. Income from operations for our business segments are provided below (Dollars in thousands). Fiscal Year Ended April 3, March 29, Increase 2004 2003 (Decrease) % Change Income (Loss) from operations Wholesale $ 93,128 $ 124,476 $ (31,348 ) (25.2 %) Retail 72,915 40,366 32,549 80.6 % Licensing 127,319 138,018 (10,699 ) (7.8 %) 293,362 302,860 $ (9,498 ) (3.1 %) Less: Restructuring Charge (19,566 ) (14,443 ) Income from operations $ 273,796 $ 288,417 Wholesale operating income decreased primarily as a result of decreased net sales in our domestic mens business and European wholesale operations. The incremental effect of Lauren sales in the fourth quarter on our wholesale business income from operations was largely offset by start up and ordinary operating expenses associated with the Lauren wholesale business. Retail operating income increased primarily as a result of increased net sales and improved gross profits as a percentage of net revenues. These increases were partially offset by the increase in selling salaries and related costs in connection with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion. Licensing income decreased primarily due to the loss of the Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones. This decrease was partially offset by improvements in the footwear business and by the inclusion of the operations of the Japanese Master License. Foreign Currency (Gains) Losses. The effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss of $1.9 million during Fiscal 2004, compared to a $0.5 million loss during Fiscal 2003. These losses primarily related to transaction losses on unhedged inventory 36 Table of Contents purchases and royalty payments in Europe resulting from increases in the value of the Euro compared to the dollar. These losses are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are converted to U.S. dollars. In the prior period, these losses primarily related to transaction losses on the unhedged portion of our Euro denominated debt caused by appreciation of the Euro until we entered into the cross currency swap in June 2002, which were partially offset by $1.3 million of gains recorded on the Japanese forward contracts that we entered into in November of 2002. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $10.0 million in Fiscal 2004 from $13.5 million for Fiscal 2003. This decrease was due to the repayment of approximately $100.0 million of short term borrowings during Fiscal 2004, as well as decreased interest rates as a result of the May 2003 interest rate swap described in Liquidity and Capital Resources Derivative Instruments. Provision for Income Taxes. The effective tax rate was 36.3% for Fiscal 2004 compared to 36.5% for Fiscal 2003. Other (Income) Expense, Net. Other (income) expense, net was $(4.1) million for Fiscal 2004. This reflects $5.5 million of income related to the 20% equity interest in the company that holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan, net of $1.4 million of minority interest expense associated with our Japanese master license, both of which were acquired in February 2003 (except for the additional 2% equity interest in the entity that holds the sublicenses that we acquired in May 2003). Net Income. Net income decreased for Fiscal 2004 to $171.0 million from $174.2 million for Fiscal 2003, or 6.5% and 7.1% of net revenues, respectively. Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis decreased by $0.07 to $1.69 per share as a result of the decrease in net income for the reasons previously discussed and an increase in diluted shares outstanding of 1.7 million due to the exercise of stock options, a higher average stock price and the award of restricted stock units to executives. Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002 Net Sales. Net sales for Fiscal 2003 were $2.189 billion, an increase of $67.0 million, or 3.2%, over net sales for Fiscal 2002. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year ended March 30, 2002, net sales would have been $2.094 billion resulting in a current fiscal year increase of 4.6%. Net sales results by segment were as follows (Dollars in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended March 29, March 30, Increase 2003 2002 (Decrease) % Change Net revenues: Wholesale $ 1,187,363 $ 1,198,060 $ (10,697 ) (0.9 %) Retail 1,001,958 924,273 77,685 8.4 % Licensing 250,019 241,374 8,645 3.6 % Total Net Revenue $ 2,439,340 $ 2,363,707 $ 75,633 3.2 % Wholesale net sales decreased $10.7 million, or 0.9%, to $1.187 billion for Fiscal 2003 from $1.198 billion in Fiscal 2002. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year ended March 30, 2002, wholesale net sales would have 37 Table of Contents been $1.164 billion and the increase would have been 2.0%. The increase primarily resulted from the following: Increases in the European wholesale business of $66.4 million, exclusive of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which resulted primarily from continued European expansion and the inclusion of PRL Fashions operations for the full year, as well as; $38.9 million from the favorable impact of Euro currency fluctuation, partially offset by a strategic streamlining of the amount of product sold to the department stores and: the elimination of the womens Ralph Lauren Sport and the Lauren for Men lines which contributed a decrease of $70.2 million. Retail net sales increased $77.7 million, or 8.4%, to $1.002 billion for Fiscal 2003 from $924.3 million in Fiscal 2002. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year ended March 30, 2002, retail net sales would have been $929.4 million, resulting in a $72.5 million increase. This increase was primarily driven by the following: a $49.4 million, or 8.4%, increase in comparable outlet store sales, partially offset by $7.1 million, or 2.3%, decrease in our total full price stores (comparable store sales information includes both Polo Ralph Lauren stores and Club Monaco stores). a $9.9 million increase as a result of the favorable impact of Euro currency fluctuation. $30 million of the increase was due to worldwide store expansion. The Company opened 19 stores, net of closings during the year, ending the period with 255 stores as compared to 236 stores in the prior year. Included in these openings were 11 Polo Ralph Lauren stores, seven Club Monaco stores (including two Club Monaco Caban Home stores), and seven outlet stores (including one full line outlet store, one Polo Jeans outlet store and five European outlet stores). Offsetting these openings were the closings of three outlet stores (including two full line outlet stores and one Polo Jeans outlet store), two Club Monaco stores and one Club Monaco outlet store. Licensing Revenue. Licensing revenue increased approximately $8.6 million, or 3.6%, to $250.0 million in Fiscal 2003. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year ended March 30, 2002, licensing revenue would have been $237.4 million, resulting in a 5.3%, or $12.6 million, increase primarily driven by increased revenues from our international and product licensing partners of approximately $4.2 million and $8.5 million, respectively. Gross Profit. Gross profit dollars increased $60.8 million, or 5.3%, in Fiscal 2003 over Fiscal 2002. Gross profits as a percent of net sales increased to 49.5% in 2003 from 48.5% in 2002. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year ended March 30, 2002, gross profit percentage would have been 48.2%. The increase in gross profit rate reflected improved product performance and merchandise margins in the domestic retail businesses, partially offset by a small reduction in wholesale margins. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased $67.2 million, or 8.0%, to $904.8 million in Fiscal 2003 from $837.6 million, as compared to Fiscal 2002. These expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 37.1% in 2003 from 35.4% in 2002. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year ended March 30, 2002, SG&A expenses would have been $845.0 million, or 36.3% of net revenues. The increase in Fiscal 2003 was primarily due to higher selling salaries and related costs in connection with the incremental increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion, the expansion of the European wholesale business, the inclusion of PRL Fashions operations, which was acquired in October 2002, as well as the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily the strengthening of the Euro. These increases were offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization of $9.1 million as a result of the 38 Table of Contents implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and the recording of a gain of approximately $5.0 million related to an assignment of the sub lease for one store location. Restructuring Charge. During Fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic review of our European businesses and formalized our plans to centralize and more efficiently consolidate our operations. The major initiatives of our plan included the following: consolidation of our headquarters from five cities in three countries to one location; the consolidation of our European logistics operations to Italy; and the migration of all European information systems to a standard global system. We have completed the consultation process for consolidation of the headquarters and anticipate completion of the consolidation and migration during Fiscal 2004. In connection with the implementation of this plan, the Company recorded a total $14.4 million restructuring charge (approximately $12.3 million for the wholesale business and $2.1 million for the retail business). During Fiscal 2002, the Company recorded a $16.0 million restructuring charge for additional lease termination costs associated with the closure of our retail stores. Operating Income. Operating income decreased $6.4 million or 2.1% from fiscal 2002 as follows (Dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended March 29, March 30, Increase 2003 2002 (Decrease) % Change Income (Loss) from operations: Wholesale $ 124,476 $ 158,401 $ (33,925 ) (21.4 %) Retail 40,366 18,799 21,567 114.7 % Licensing 138,018 132,012 6,006 4.6 % 302,860 309,212 $ (6,352 ) (2.1 %) Less: Restructuring Charge (14,443 ) (16,000 ) Income from operations $ 288,417 $ 293,212 Wholesale operating income decreased $33.9 million or 21.4% from fiscal 2002. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year end March 30, 2002, wholesale operating income would have increased as a result of the increases in sales as previously discussed and lower operating expenses. Retail operating income increased $21.6 million or 114.7% primarily as a result of the sales increases discussed earlier as well as improved gross margin rates. Licensing income increased $6.0 million or 4.6% primarily as a result of the sales increases discussed previously. Foreign Currency Losses (Gains). The effect of foreign currency decreased to a loss of $0.5 million in Fiscal 2003, compared to a $1.8 million gain in Fiscal 2002. These gains are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are converted to U.S. dollars. In Fiscal 2003, these losses primarily related to approximately $3.2 million of transaction losses on the unhedged portion of our Euro debt in the first quarter of the fiscal year, which resulted from increases in the Eurodollar rate until we entered into the cross currency swap in June 2002. These losses were partially offset by $2.4 million of gains realized on the Japanese forward contracts, which we further describe in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. In Fiscal 2002, the gains were derived from transaction gains on the unhedged portion of our Euro debt, which resulted from decreases in the Eurodollar rate. 39 Table of Contents Interest Expense, Net. Interest expense decreased to $13.5 million in Fiscal 2003 from $19.0 million in Fiscal 2002. This decrease was primarily due to decreased short term borrowings and long term Euro borrowings during Fiscal 2003. Approximately $2.9 million of the decrease resulted from reduced interest rates as a result of the cross currency swap, which was entered into in connection with our Euro debt in June 2002 and is further described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. The remaining decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates, during the fiscal year ended March 29, 2003. These decreases were partially offset by higher Eurodollar exchange rates, which affect the Euro denominated interest payments on the portion of the Euro debt not covered by the cross currency swap. Provision for Income Taxes. Our tax provision for Fiscal 2003 was $100.2 million as compared to $103.5 million in Fiscal 2002, a 36.5% and 37.5% effective tax rate, respectively. This decline is the result of the implementation of tax strategies. Net Income. Net income increased in Fiscal 2003 to $174.2 million from $172.5 million in Fiscal 2002, or 7.1% and 7.3% of net revenues, respectively. Diluted earnings per common share was $1.76 and $1.75 for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002, respectively. The change in diluted earnings per share resulted from the $1.7 million increase in Net income partially offset by a 0.7 million increase in the number of shares outstanding primarily as a result of the exercise of stock options and additional restricted shares. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund growth in working capital (primarily accounts receivable and inventory) to support projected sales increases, construction and renovation of shop within shops, investment in the technological upgrading of our distribution centers and information systems, expenditures related to retail store expansion, acquisitions, dividends, and other corporate activities, including the start up costs of bringing the Lauren and Ralph lines in house. Sources of liquidity to fund ongoing and future cash requirements include cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, credit facilities and other borrowings. Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 We ended Fiscal 2004 with $343.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $277.3 million of debt outstanding compared to $343.6 million and $349.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and debt outstanding, respectively, at March 29, 2003. This represents a $72.0 million increase in our cash net of debt position over the last twelve months which is primarily attributable to the following factors: (i) reduced spending on acquisitions and investments, (ii) increased proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, (iii) partially offset by reduced cash flows from operations and an increase in Euro debt of $28.9 million as a result of the strengthening of the Euro. Additionally, capital expenditures were $123.0 million for Fiscal 2004 compared to $98.7 million in Fiscal 2003. As of April 3, 2004, we had $277.3 million outstanding in long term Euro debt based on the year end Euro exchange rate, an increase of $28.9 million from Fiscal 2003. The increase was entirely due to changes in the Euro to Dollar exchange rate. We were also contingently liable for $35.3 million in outstanding letters of credit primarily related to commitments for the purchase of inventory. The weighted average interest rate on our borrowings at April 3, 2004 was 3.8%. Accounts receivable increased $65.9 million primarily as a result of the inception of sales under the Lauren label and the strengthening of the Euro. $86.5 million of the increase was due to Lauren and $13.2 million was due to the change in the value of the Euro. These increases were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable in our other wholesale divisions resulting from sales decreases and the timing of payments. 40 Table of Contents Inventories decreased $0.1 million in Fiscal 2004. The inception of the Lauren line was responsible for a $34.1 million increase and the strengthening of the Euro caused a $14.3 million increase in inventory. These increases were more than offset by reductions in inventory in our Retail and Mens wholesale business as a result of improvements in our supply chain forecasting and management and reduced inventory requirements in our mens business as a result of planned reductions in sales. Other current assets increased $37.2 million from Fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of increases in European Value Added Tax receivables and the effect of the timing of the Fiscal year end on prepaid items. Accounts payable increased $6.0 million compared to Fiscal 2003 primarily as result of the addition of the Lauren line partially offset by reductions in our mens line due to a decrease in inventory purchases and reductions in Europe due to the timing of year end invoice receipts. Accrued expenses increased $71.7 million primarily as a result of the addition of the Lauren label, increases in the European Value Added Tax payable, and increases in Europe due to the timing of year end invoice receipts. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $210.6 million during Fiscal 2004 compared to $269.0 million in Fiscal 2003. This $58.4 million decrease in cash flow was driven primarily by the year over year changes in working capital described above and the decrease in net income of $3.2 million. During Fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic review of our European business and formalized our plans to centralize and more efficiently consolidate its business operations. In connection with the implementation of this plan, we had total cash outlays of approximately $13.3 million during the year ended April 3, 2004. We also had cash outlays of $8.3 million during Fiscal 2004 in connection with our 2001 restructuring plan, primarily related to lease termination costs. It is expected that the remaining liabilities of both plans will be paid throughout Fiscal 2005. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $132.7 million in Fiscal 2004 as compared to $166.3 million in Fiscal 2003. Both the Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003 net cash used primarily reflected capital expenditures related to retail expansion and upgrading our systems and facilities, as well as shop within shop expenditures. The Fiscal 2004 net cash used also reflects $5.4 million for an additional 2% equity interest in the company that holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan, an additional $3.5 million primarily for additional transaction costs to acquire a 50% interest in the Japanese master license, $1.0 million for an additional payment on the first earn out payment calculation in connection with the PRL Fashions of Europe SRL acquisition and $7.5 million for the acquisition of a license for the use of trademarks in November 2003. Fiscal 2003 net cash used, reflects $78 million primarily for the acquisition of a 50% interest in the Japanese Master license and an 18% equity interest in the company holding the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens, and jeans business in Japan. Our anticipated capital expenditures for Fiscal 2005 approximate $143.0 million. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $76.4 million in Fiscal 2004 compared to $16.7 million in Fiscal 2003. Cash used in financing activities during Fiscal 2004, consisted of the net repayment of short term borrowings of $100.9 million and the payment of $14.8 million in dividends, partially offset by proceeds of $40.4 million from the exercise of stock options. Cash used during Fiscal 2003 primarily consisted of net borrowings of $19.7 million and repurchases of common stock totaling $4.7 million, partially offset by $7.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 41 Table of Contents Fiscal 2003 compared to Fiscal 2002 We ended Fiscal 2003 with $343.6 million in cash and equivalents and $349.4 million of debt outstanding compared to $244.7 million and $318.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and debt outstanding, respectively, at March 30, 2002. This represents a $67.8 million improvement in our debt net of cash position and was primarily attributable to changes in working capital due to the factors discussed below, partially offset by approximately $73.0 million of purchase price payments connected with our acquisition of a 50% interest in the Japanese master license and an 18% equity interest in the company which holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan. Capital expenditures were $98.7 million for Fiscal 2003, compared to $88.0 million in Fiscal 2002. We acquired several retail locations from certain of our licensees in Belgium, Germany and Argentina for a total purchase price of approximately $4.6 million. As of March 29, 2003, we had $100.9 million outstanding in short term bank borrowings, of which $50.0 million was repaid in April 2003 with the remainder repaid in June 2003. Additionally, we had $248.5 million outstanding in long term Euro debt based on the quarter end Euro exchange rate. We were also contingently liable for $19.1 million in outstanding letters of credit primarily related to commitments for the purchase of inventory. The weighted average interest rate on our borrowings at March 29, 2003 was 5.4%. Accounts receivable increased to $375.8 million, or 6.3% at March 29, 2003 compared to $353.6 million at March 30, 2002 due to the timing of shipments. Approximately $23.0 million of the increase resulted from currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily the strengthening of the Euro. Improvements were made in our days sales outstanding, however, the incremental effect of these improvements was offset by the additional royalty receivables recorded in Fiscal 2003 compared to Fiscal 2002. Inventories increased $14.0 million, or 4.0%, at the end of Fiscal 2003 compared to the end of Fiscal 2002. This increase reflects the build up of certain inventory for European retail stores as part of our continued expansion. Additionally an increase of $23.7 million resulted from currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily the strengthening of the Euro. These increases were partially offset by decreases in other business lines. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $269.0 million during 2003 compared to $299.7 million in 2002. This $30.7 million decrease in cash flow was driven primarily by year over year changes in accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and accounts payable. During Fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic review of our European business and formalized our plans to centralize and more efficiently consolidate its business operations. In connection with the implementation of this plan, we recorded a restructuring charge of $14.4 million and had total cash outlays of approximately $3.8 million during the year ended March 29, 2003. During Fiscal 2001 and 1999 we implemented two plans: the 2001 Operational Plan and 1999 Restructuring Plan. Total cash outlays related to the 2001 Operational Plan and 1999 Restructuring Plan were $9.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively for, Fiscal 2003. As of March 29, 2003, we settled all remaining liabilities related to the 1999 Restructuring Plan. In May 2003, we settled $4.6 million of the remaining $5.2 million in liabilities related to the 2001 Operational Plan, the remaining $0.6 million was settled in Fiscal 2004. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased to $166.3 million in Fiscal 2003, as compared to $116.0 million in Fiscal 2002. Both the Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 net cash used primarily reflected shop within shops and other capital expenditures related to retail expansion and upgrading our systems and facilities. The fiscal 2003 net cash used also reflects $78.0 million primarily for our acquisition of a 50% interest in the 42 Table of Contents Japanese master license and an 18% equity interest in the company which holds the sublicense for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens, and jeans business in Japan. Fiscal 2002 net cash used reflects $23.7 million for the acquisition of PRL Fashions. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $16.7 million in Fiscal 2003 compared to $40.3 million in Fiscal 2002. This change is primarily due to the net repayment of short term debt of $12.0 million, the repurchase of $7.7 million of our Euro debt and the repurchase of our common stock of $4.7 million, offset by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $7.7 million for Fiscal 2003; compared to $52.2 million of short term debt repayment, $10.6 million of Euro debt repurchases, $2.1 million of common stock repurchases offset by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $24.5 million in Fiscal 2002. In March 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, subject to market conditions, of up to $100.0 million of our Class A common stock. Share repurchases were to be made in the open market over a two year period, which commenced April 1, 1998. The Board of Directors has extended the stock repurchase program through April 1, 2006. Shares acquired under the repurchase program will be used for stock option programs and for other corporate purposes. As of April 3, 2004, we had repurchased 4.1 million shares of our Class A common stock at an aggregate cost of $77.5 million. As of April 3, 2004, we had approximately $21.0 million remaining in our stock repurchase program. In November 1999, we issued Euro 275.0 million of 6.125% notes due November 2006. Our Euro debt is listed on the London Stock Exchange. The net proceeds from the Euro offering were $281.5 million, based on the Euro exchange rate on the issuance date. Interest on the Euro debt is payable annually. A portion of these net proceeds was used to acquire Poloco S.A.S.(our principal European subsidiary) and the remaining net proceeds were retained for general corporate purposes. Through Fiscal 2004, we repurchased Euro 47.7 million, or $43.6 million, based on Euro exchange rates at the time of repurchase of our outstanding Euro debt. In November 2002, we terminated both our 1997 bank credit facility and our 1999 senior bank credit facility and entered into a new credit facility. The 1997 bank credit facility provided for a $225.0 million revolving line of credit and matured on December 31, 2002, while the 1999 senior bank credit facility consisted of a $20.0 million revolving line of credit and an $80.0 million term loan, both of which were scheduled to mature on June 30, 2003. The new credit facility is with a syndicate of banks and consists of a $300.0 million revolving line of credit, subject to increase to $375.0 million, which is available for direct borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit. It will mature on November 18, 2005. As of April 3, 2004, we had no debt outstanding under the new facility. Borrowings under this facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to (i) the higher of the Federal Funds Effective Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 1/2 of one percent, and the prime commercial lending rate of JP Morgan Chase Bank in effect from time to time, or (ii) the LIBO Rate (as defined) in effect from time to time, as adjusted for the Federal Reserve Boards Eurocurrency Liabilities maximum reserve percentages, and a margin based on our then current credit ratings. Our 2002 bank credit facility requires that we maintain certain covenants: a minimum consolidated tangible net worth, and a maximum of Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR (as such terms are defined in the credit facility) ratio. The credit facility also contains covenants that, subject to specified exceptions, restrict our ability to: incur additional debt; incur liens and contingent liabilities; 43 Table of Contents sell or dispose of our assets, including equity interests; merge with or acquire other companies, liquidate or dissolve; engage in businesses that are not a related line of business; make loans, advances or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make investments. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the credit facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The credit facility specifies a number of events of default, many of which are subject to applicable grace or cure periods, including, among others, the failure to make timely principal and interest payments, to satisfy the covenants, or to maintain the required financial performance requirements described above. Additionally, the agreement provides that an event of default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren and related entities fail to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power of our common stock. As of April 3, 2004, the Company was in compliance with all financial and non financial debt covenants. In Fiscal 2003, the Board of Directors initiated a dividend program consisting of quarterly cash dividends of $0.05 per outstanding share, or $0.20 per outstanding share on an annual basis, on our common stock. Dividends of $0.05 per outstanding share declared to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 27, 2003, September 26, 2003, December 26, 2003 and April 2, 2004 were paid on July 11, 2003, October 10, 2003, January 9, 2003 and April 16, 2004, respectively. We believe that cash from ongoing operations and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations, capital requirements, the stock repurchase program, cash dividends and other corporate activities for the next twelve months. Commitments The following table summarizes the Companys contractual cash obligations by period as of April 3, 2004: Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years Thereafter Total (Dollars in thousands) Inventory purchase commitments $ 250,622 $ $ $ $ 250,622 Long term Euro debt 277,345 277,345 Capitalized leases 1,843 2,367 4,210 Operating leases 107,736 195,100 168,282 419,361 890,479 Additional acquisition purchase price payments 7,000 7,000 Total $ 367,201 $ 474,812 $ 168,282 $ 419,361 $ 1,429,656 Derivative Instruments. In June 2002, we entered into a cross currency rate swap which was scheduled to terminate in November 2006. The cross currency rate swap converted 105.2 million, 6.125% fixed rate borrowings into $100.0 million, LIBOR plus 1.24% variable rate borrowings. We entered into the cross currency rate swap to minimize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on both principal and interest payments on our long term Euro debt, and to minimize the impact of changes in the fair value of the Euro debt due to changes in LIBOR, the benchmark interest rate. The swap was designated as a fair value hedge under SFAS No. 133. Hedge ineffectiveness was measured as the difference between the respective 44 Table of Contents gains or losses recognized in earnings from the changes in the fair value of the cross currency rate swap and the Euro debt. In May 2003, we terminated the cross currency rate swap and entered into an interest rate swap that will terminate in November 2006. The interest rate swap is being used to convert 105.2 million, 6.125% fixed rate borrowings into 105.2 million, EURIBOR minus 1.55% variable rate borrowings. We entered into the interest rate swap to minimize the impact of changes in the fair value of the Euro debt due to changes in EURIBOR, the benchmark interest rate. The swap had been designated as a fair value hedge under SFAS No. 133. Hedge ineffectiveness is measured as the difference between the respective gains or losses recognized in earnings from the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and the Euro debt resulting from changes in the benchmark interest rate, and was de minimis for Fiscal 2004. In addition, we have designated the entire principal of the Euro debt as a hedge of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary. As a result, changes in the fair value of the Euro debt resulting from changes in the Euro rate are reported net of income taxes in Accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements as an unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency hedges. On April 6, 2004 we executed an interest rate swap to convert the fixed interest rate on Euro 50 million of the Eurobonds to a floating rate (EURIBOR based). After the execution of this swap, approximately Euro 77 million of the Eurobonds remained at a fixed interest rate. We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts as hedges relating to identifiable currency positions to reduce our risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inventory and intercompany royalty payments. Gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized as adjustments to either the basis of those assets or foreign exchange gains/ losses, as applicable. At April 3, 2004, we had the following foreign exchange contracts outstanding: (i) to deliver Euro 67.1 million in exchange for $73.9 million through Fiscal 2005 and (ii) to deliver 8,248 million Japanese Yen in exchange for $71.0 million through Fiscal 2008. At April 3, 2004, the fair value of these contracts resulted in unrealized losses, net of taxes of $6.6 million and $6.3 million, for the Euro forward contracts and Japanese Yen forward contracts, respectively. To the extent that any derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, they are recorded at fair value, with all gains or losses recognized immediately in the current period earnings. In November 2002, we entered into forward contracts on 6.2 billion Japanese Yen that terminated in February 2003. While these transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, we entered into these forward contracts to minimize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the Japanese Yen denominated purchase price described in the agreements related to the purchase of a 50% interest in the Japanese master license and an 18% equity interest in the company which holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan, which were consummated during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003. We recognized $2.4 million of foreign currency gains on this transaction, which are recorded in foreign currency losses(gains) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We recognize foreign currency gains or losses in connection with our Euro debt and certain short term foreign currency contracts based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. In connection with recording these contracts at fair market value, we recognized $1.9 million in foreign currency losses in Fiscal 2004, and $0.5 million in Fiscal 2003 included as a component of foreign currency losses (gains) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. The Company does not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or unconsolidated special purpose entities. 45 Table of Contents Seasonality of Business Our business is affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments to retail customers and key vacation travel and holiday shopping periods in the retail segment. As a result of the growth in our retail operations and licensing revenue, historical quarterly operating trends and working capital requirements may not be indicative of future performances. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. Fiscal 2002 reflects the change in the fiscal year end of certain of our European subsidiaries as reported in our consolidated financial statements. See Consolidation of European Entities Change in Reporting Period. In connection with our acquisition of a 50% interest in the Japanese master license and the 18% (later increased to 20%) equity interest in the company which holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan, results for these operations are reflected in our consolidated financial statements for Fiscal 2004. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting policies employed by the Company, including the use of estimates, are presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report of Form 10 K. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and the results of operations, and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Companys most critical accounting policies, discussed below, pertain to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill, other long lived intangible assets, income taxes, accrued expenses and derivative instruments. In applying such policies, management must use some amounts that are based upon its informed judgments and best estimates. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgements and available information. The estimates that we make are based upon historical factors, current circumstances and the experience and judgment of our management. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations. Changes in such estimates, based on more accurate future information, may affect amounts reported in future periods. We are not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances which would result in different amounts being reported that would materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. Revenue Recognition Wholesale sales are recognized when the title and risk of loss passes to the customer and are recorded net of returns, discounts and allowances. Returns and allowances require pre approval from management. Discounts are based on trade terms. Estimates for end of season allowances are based on historic trends, seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic conditions and retailer performance. The Companys historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. Sales by our retail and outlet stores are recognized when 46 Table of Contents goods are sold to consumers, net of returns. Licensing revenue is recognized based upon shipment of licensed products sold by our licensees, net of allowances. Accounts Receivable, Net In the normal course of business, we extend credit to customers, who satisfy pre defined credit criteria. Accounts receivable, net, as shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is net of allowances and anticipated discounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements, assessments of collectibility based on historic trends, the financial condition of our customers and an evaluation of the economic conditions. Costs associated with potential returns of products as well as allowable customer markdowns and operational chargebacks, net of the expected recoveries, are included as a reduction to net sales and are part of the provision for allowances included in accounts receivable, net. These provisions result from divisional seasonal negotiations, as well as historic deduction trends net of expected recoveries and an evaluation of current market conditions. Should circumstances change or economic or distribution channel conditions deteriorate significantly, we may need to increase these provisions. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost First in, First out, (FIFO), method, or market. We continually evaluate the composition of our inventories assessing slow turning, ongoing product as well as prior seasons fashion product. Market value of distressed inventory is determined based on historical sales trends for the category of inventory involved, the impact of market trends and economic conditions. Estimates may differ from actual results due to quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions. We review our inventory position on a quarterly basis at a minimum and adjust our estimates based on revised projections and current market conditions. If economic conditions worsen, we incorrectly anticipate trends or unexpected events occur, our estimates could be proven overly optimistic, and required adjustments could materially adversely affect future results of operations. The Companys historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. Goodwill, Other Intangibles and Long Lived Assets Effective March 31, 2002, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer are to be amortized, but rather be tested at least annually for impairment. This pronouncement also requires that intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their respective lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Before adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 142, we amortized goodwill on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, ranging from 11 to 40 years. Beginning in Fiscal 2003, consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 142, we no longer amortize goodwill. The Company reviews goodwill annually for impairment. In addition, trademarks that are owned, that have been deemed to have indefinite lives, are reviewed at least annually for potential value impairment. Trademarks that are licensed by the Company from third parties are amortized over the individual terms of the respective license agreement, which approximates 10 years. Goodwill amortization expense was $9.1 million in Fiscal 2002. Accumulated goodwill amortization was $23.7 million at March 30, 2002. 47 Table of Contents We assess the carrying value of long lived and intangible assets, with finite lives, as current facts and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. In evaluating the fair value and future benefits of all intangible assets, we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the individual assets over the remaining amortization period and would recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value exceeded the expected future cash flows. The impairment loss would be measured based upon the difference between the fair value of the asset and its recorded carrying value. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for long lived and intangible asset writedowns recorded in connection with our Fiscal 2001 Operational Plan and Fiscal 1999 Restructuring Plan. During Fiscal 2004, there were no material impairment losses recorded in connection with this analysis. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. In accordance with this statement, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as measured by enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the periods when the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be settled or realized. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provisions for income taxes. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. It is our policy to establish provisions for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities. We establish the provisions based upon managements assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences, tax credits and interest expense applied to temporary difference adjustments. The tax provisions are analyzed periodically (at least annually) and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustments to those provisions. Accrued Expenses Accrued expenses for employee insurance, workers compensation, profit sharing, contracted advertising, professional fees and other outstanding Company obligations are assessed based on claims experience and statistical trends, open contractual obligations, and estimates based on projections and current requirements. If these trends change significantly, then actual results would likely be impacted. Our historical estimates of these costs and our provisions have not differed materially from actual results. Derivative Instruments SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted, requires that each derivative instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability and measured at its fair value. The statement also requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings in either income (loss) from continuing operations or Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), depending on whether the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. We use foreign currency forward contracts for the specific purpose of hedging the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows associated primarily with inventory purchases mainly for our European businesses, royalty payments from our Japanese licensee, and other specific activities. These instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and, in accordance with SFAS No. 133, to the extent the hedges are highly effective, the changes in fair value are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of related tax effects, with the corresponding asset or liability recorded in the balance sheet. The ineffective portion of the cash flow hedge, if any, is recognized in current period earnings. Amounts recorded in Accumulated 48 Table of Contents other comprehensive income are reflected in current period earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If the relative values of the currencies involved in the hedging activities were to move dramatically, such movement could have a significant impact on our results of operations. We are not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances which would result in different amounts being reported that would materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. Hedge accounting requires that at the beginning of each hedge period, we justify an expectation that the hedge will be highly effective. This effectiveness assessment involves an estimation of the probability of the occurrence of transactions for cash flow hedges. The use of different assumptions and changing market conditions may impact the results of the effectiveness assessment and ultimately the timing of when changes in derivative fair values and underlying hedged items are recorded in earnings. We hedge our net investment position in subsidiaries which conduct business in Euros by borrowing directly in foreign currency and designating a portion of our Euro denominated debt as a hedge of net investments. Under SFAS No. 133, changes in the fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in foreign currency translation, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. Inflation The rate of inflation over the past few years has not had a significant impact on our sales or profitability. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to Our Consolidated Financial Statements. Alternative Accounting Methods In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Companys significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options and inventories. Two alternative methods for accounting for stock options are available, the intrinsic value method and the fair value method. The Company uses the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options, and accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized. Under the fair value method, the determination of the pro forma amounts involves several assumptions including option life and future volatility. If the fair value method were used, diluted earnings per share for Fiscal 2004 would decrease approximately 10%. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Two alternative methods for accounting for wholesale inventories are the First In, First Out (FIFO) method and the Last in, First out (LIFO) method. The Company accounts for all wholesale inventories under the FIFO method. Two alternative methods for accounting for retail inventories are the retail method and the cost method. The Company accounts for all retail inventories under the cost method. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December, 2003, The Securities Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (SAB 104), Revenue Recognition. SAB 104 expands previously issued guidance on the subject of Revenue Recognition and provides specific criteria which must be fulfilled to permit the recognition of revenue from transactions. The Company does not expect the issuance of SAB 104 to have a material effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial position. 49 Table of Contents In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. This statement requires that certain financial instruments that, under previous guidance, could be accounted for as equity be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position. Most of the guidance in SFAS No. 150 is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial position. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, except as for the provisions that relate to SFAS No. 133 implementation issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to June 15, 2003, which should continue to be applied in accordance with their respective effective dates. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial position. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. This statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements for SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation. SFAS No. 148 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2002. The Company does not intend to expense stock options; therefore the adoption of this statement did not have any impact on the consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement required companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs covered by SFAS No. 146 include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing, or exit or disposal activity. SFAS No. 146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 146. In January 2003, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities which was amended by FIN46R in December, 2003. A variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. Historically, entities generally were not consolidated unless the entity was controlled through voting interests. FIN 46R changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. FIN 46R also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46R apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46R apply to existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after December 15, 2003. Also, certain disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity 50 Table of Contents was established. The adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations or financial position of the company. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements regarding our interest in Ralph Lauren Media, LLC. In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value and requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures, even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote. Generally, FIN 45 applies to certain types of financial guarantees that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entitys failure to perform under an obligation agreement; indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to an indemnified party based on changes in an underlying that is related to an asset, liability or an equity security of the indemnified party; or indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Disclosure requirements under FIN 45 are effective for financial statements ending after December 15, 2002, and are applicable to all guarantees issued by the guarantor subject under FIN 45s scope, including guarantees issued prior to FIN 45. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial position. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Our policy allows for the use of derivative financial instruments for identifiable market risk exposures, including interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. During Fiscal 2004, there were significant fluctuations in the value of the Euro to Dollar exchange rate. In June 2002, we entered into a cross currency rate swap to minimize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the long term Euro debt and the impact of fluctuations in the interest rate on the fair value of the long term Euro debt. In May 2003, we terminated the cross currency rate swap, and entered into an interest rate swap, to minimize the impact of changes in the fair value of the Euro debt due to changes in EURIBOR, the benchmark interest rate. The following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices and theoretical pricing models obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities. These quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We have assets and liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies related to international subsidiaries. At April 3, 2004, we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts in Europe and Japan to purchase $144.9 million U.S. dollars through March 2004. We believe that these financial instruments should not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should offset losses and gains on the assets, liabilities, and transactions being hedged. We are exposed to credit related losses if the counterparty to the financial instruments fails to perform its obligations. However, we do not expect the counterparty, which presently has high credit ratings, to fail to meet its obligations. 51 Table of Contents Our primary foreign currency exposure relates to our Euro debt. As of April 3, 2004, the fair value of our fixed Euro debt was $292.6 million, based on its quoted market price as listed on the London Stock exchange and translated using Euro exchange rates in effect as of April 3, 2004. The potential increase in fair value of our fixed rate Euro debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in exchange rates would have been approximately $29.3 million at April 3, 2004. As of April 3, 2004, a hypothetical immediate 10% adverse change in exchange rates would have had a $1.8 million unfavorable impact over a one year period on our earnings and cash flows. Interest Rates Our primary interest rate exposure relates to our fixed rate debt. The potential increase in fair value of our fixed rate Euro debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates would have been approximately $4.1 million at April 3, 2004. We employ a fair value hedging strategy utilizing interest rate swaps to effectively float a portion of our interest rate exposure on our fixed rate Euro debt. On April 6, 2004, the company executed an interest rate swap to convert the fixed interest rate on 50 million of the Eurobonds to a floating rate. After the execution of this swap, approximately 77 million of Eurobonds remained at fixed interest rate. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis is a summary and should be read together with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes thereto which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We use a 52 53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest March 31. All references to Fiscal 2004 represent the 53 week fiscal year ended April 3, 2004, while references to Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 represent the 52 week fiscal years ended March 29, 2003 and March 30, 2002, respectively. Overview We operate in three integrated business operation segments: wholesale, retail and licensing. Wholesale consists of womens and mens apparel designed and marketed worldwide, which are divided primarily into three groups: Polo Brands, Lauren and Collection Brands. In each of the wholesale groups, we offer discrete brand offerings, directed by teams comprising design, merchandising, sales and production staff who work together to conceive, develop and merchandise product groupings organized to convey a variety of design concepts. This segment includes the core business Polo Ralph Lauren as well as Lauren, Blue Label, Polo Golf, RLX Polo Sport, Womens Ralph Lauren Collection and Black Label, and Mens Purple Label Collection. Retail consists of our worldwide Ralph Lauren retail operations that sell the product through full price and outlet stores and Club Monaco full price and outlet stores. Licensing consists of product, international and home licensing alliances, each of which pay us royalties based upon sales of our product, and are generally subject to minimum royalty payments. We work closely with our licensing partners to ensure that products are developed, marketed and distributed in a manner consistent with the distinctive perspective and lifestyle associated with our brand. Fiscal 2004 Overall Results During Fiscal 2004, overall revenue increased $210.3 million or 8.6% primarily as a result of strong growth in our retail business and the introduction of the Lauren line in our Wholesale business, partially offset primarily by planned sales declines in our Mens Wholesale business due to a reduction in off price sales. Our licensing revenue increased $18.8 million or 7.5% as a result of growth in the footwear business, as well as the incremental effect of the consolidation 30 Table of Contents of revenues from the Japanese master license, partially offset by the loss of licensing income from the Lauren label, previously operated by Jones Apparel Group, Inc. The inclusion of the 53rd week was responsible for an estimated $39.5 million of the sales increase. Gross profit increased $115.7 million or 9.6% and our gross margin as a percentage of sales (gross margin rate) increased to 49.9% from 49.5% in the prior year. The increasing gross profit rate reflects the benefits of advertising, improved product mix and targeted marketing as well as a continued focus on inventory management. Operating expenses increased $125.2 million or 13.8% primarily as a result of start up expenses associated with the Lauren line and the increased operating expenses associated with our growth in retail sales. During Fiscal 2004, we recorded restructuring charges of $19.6 million. These charges are composed of an additional $10.4 million for lease termination costs associated primarily with two Club Monaco retail properties included in our 2001 operational plan due to real estate market factors that were less favorable than originally estimated, $7.9 million for additional contract termination and severance costs related to the consolidation of our European business operations and $1.3 million related to our decision to close the RRL stores. Our international operating results were affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. However, the increase in net sales due to the strengthening Euro and Canadian dollar was generally offset by a comparable increase in cost of sales and operating expenses. Balance Sheet Our financial position remains strong. Although our cash and cash equivalents decreased $0.1 million, our cash and cash equivalents net of debt position improved $72.0 million. Cash flow from operations decreased by $59.9 million primarily as a result of increases in inventory and accounts receivable associated with the start up of the Lauren line. The strengthening of the Euro has had a significant effect on certain of our balance sheet accounts including Accounts Receivable, Inventory, Accounts Payable and Long Term Debt. Recent Developments On May 25, 2004, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire certain of the assets and to assume certain of the liabilities of RL Childrenswear Company, LLC relating to the Childrenswear Licensees licensed childrenswear apparel business in the United States, Canada and Mexico (the Childrenswear Business). The purchase price for the acquisition of the Childrenswear Business will be $232.1 million in cash payable at closing, subject to a working capital adjustment, plus up to an additional $20 million of deferred and contingent cash payments. Payment of the purchase price will be funded by cash on hand and lines of credit as required. In addition, the Company will assume certain ordinary course trade payables and accrued expenses of the Childrenswear Licensee and accrued vacation obligations for the Childrenswear Licensees employees who will become employees of the Company following the closing of the acquisition. The assets of the Childrenswear Licensee being acquired by the Company include, among other things, the license; all inventories of the Childrenswear Licensee; certain leases; customer lists; supplier lists; and books and records. The Childrenswear Licensee and certain of its affiliates and shareholders have agreed to indemnify the Company for all of the liabilities of the Company related to the operation of the Business prior to the closing of the acquisition and have also agreed that they will not compete with the Business for a period of three years after the closing date. In addition, the Childrenswear Licensee and certain of its affiliates will provide information system and accounting services to the Company for a transitional period following the closing. 31 Table of Contents The closing of the proposed transaction is subject to customary conditions, including the receipt of certain third party consents and the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The closing of the transaction is anticipated to occur in late June 2004. Our licensing arrangements with Jones Apparel Group, Inc. (Jones) relating to the Lauren and Ralph lines ended on December 31, 2003 and we have begun designing, marketing and selling the Lauren line as part of our wholesale business. As discussed in Item 1 Business Recent Developments and Item 3 Legal Proceedings, we are currently in litigation with Jones over the termination of the Lauren licenses. If the Jones litigation were to be determined adversely to us, it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. However, we intend to continue to defend the case vigorously and believe our position is correct on the merits. The royalties that we received pursuant to the Lauren license agreements and Ralph license agreements represented revenues of approximately $23.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively, in Fiscal 2004 prior to the termination of these licenses on December 31, 2003 and $37.4 million and $5.3 million respectively during Fiscal 2003. We expect that the income from our sales of Lauren products will at least replace the royalty income previously attributable to the Lauren and Ralph license agreements for Fiscal 2005. In total, royalties received from Jones, including royalties from the Polo Jeans license agreements, accounted for 17.2% and 27.2% of our aggregate licensing revenue for Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003 respectively. Our Polo Jeans license agreements with Jones continue in effect. In June 2003, one of our licensing partners, WestPoint Stevens, Inc., and certain of its affiliates (WestPoint) filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. WestPoint produces bedding and bath product in our Home Collection. On December 19, 2003, the United States Bankruptcy Court approved an amended licensing agreement between WestPoint and us, which provides for the same royalty rate and minimum royalties that are not materially lower than under the previous agreement. Recent Acquisitions In February 2003, we acquired a 50% controlling interest in the Japanese master license for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan. All of the revenues and expenses for the Japanese master license are included in our consolidated statements of operations, and we record minority interest expense to reflect the share of earnings or losses allocable to the 50% minority interest holder in the Japanese master license. These amounts are included in Other (income) expense, net, in the consolidated statements of operations. We recorded minority interest expense of $1.4 million for the year ended April 3, 2004. Also, in February 2003, we acquired an 18% equity interest in the company that holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan. In May 2003, we acquired an additional 2% equity interest in this company. For the year ended April 3, 2004, we recorded $5.5 million of equity investment income related to this 20% investment in Other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations. Results for our 50% interest in the Japanese master license and the 20% equity interest in the holder of the Japanese sublicenses are reported on a one month lag. Restructurings During Fiscal 2004, we determined that the two remaining RRL stores would be closed. In connection with this decision we recorded a $1.3 million restructuring charge for lease termination costs and fixed asset impairments. 32 Table of Contents During Fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic review of our European businesses and formalized our plans to centralize and more efficiently consolidate our business operations. The major initiatives of the plan included the following: consolidation of our headquarters from five cities in three countries to one location, the consolidation of our European logistics operations to Italy and the migration of all European information systems to a standard global system. In connection with the implementation of this plan, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $7.9 million during Fiscal 2004 and a $14.4 million charge during Fiscal 2003, of which $17.1 million had been paid through April 3, 2004. It is expected that this plan will be completed and the remaining liabilities will be paid in Fiscal 2005. During Fiscal 2001, we implemented the 2001 Operational Plan. Due to real estate market factors that were less favorable than originally estimated, we recorded an additional $10.4 million charge during Fiscal 2004. We expect to settle the remaining liabilities in Fiscal 2005 or in accordance with contract terms. Results of Operations The table below sets forth results in millions of dollars and the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain items in our consolidated statements of income for our last three fiscal years: Fiscal Year Ended April 3, March 29, March 30, April 3, March 29, March 30, 2004 2003 2002 2004 2003 2002 Net sales $ 2,380.9 $ 2,189.3 $ 2,122.3 90.0 % 89.8 % 89.8 % Licensing revenue 268.8 250.0 241.4 10.0 % 10.2 % 10.2 % Net revenues 2,649.7 2,439.3 2,363.7 100 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross profit 1,323.3 1,207.6 1,146.8 49.9 % 49.5 % 48.5 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,030.0 904.8 837.6 38.9 % 37.1 % 35.4 % Restructuring charge 19.5 14.4 16.0 0.7 % 0.6 % 0.7 % Income from operations 273.8 288.4 293.2 10.3 % 11.8 % 12.4 % Foreign currency losses (gains) 1.9 0.5 (1.8 ) (0.1 )% Interest expense 10.0 13.5 19.0 0.4 % 0.6 % 0.8 % Income before provision for income taxes and other (income) expense, net 261.9 274.4 276.0 9.9 % 11.2 % 11.7 % Provision for income taxes 95.0 100.2 103.5 3.6 % 4.1 % 4.4 % Other (income) expense, net (4.1 ) (0.2 )% Net income $ 171.0 $ 174.2 $ 172.5 6.5 % 7.1 % 7.3 % Consolidation of European Entities Change in Reporting Period Effective December 30, 2001, for reporting purposes, the Company changed the fiscal year ends of its European subsidiaries as reported in the consolidated financial statements to the Saturday closest to March 31 to conform with the fiscal year end of the Company. Previously, certain of the European subsidiaries were consolidated and reported on a three month lag with a fiscal year ending December 31. Accordingly, the net activity shown below for the three month period ended December 29, 2001, for those European subsidiaries is reported as an adjustment 33 Table of Contents to retained earnings in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2002 in the accompanying financial statements: Three months Ended December 29, 2001: (Dollars in millions) Net sales $ 49.5 Gross profit 25.5 Loss before benefit from income taxes (0.7 ) Benefit from income taxes 0.3 Net loss $ (0.4 ) Net income for the year ended March 30, 2002, for the consolidated Company if the European subsidiaries remained on a three month lag would have been $159.7 million. Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 Net Revenues. Net revenues for Fiscal 2004 were $2.650 billion, an increase of $210.3 million over net revenues for Fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to increases in our retail segment as a result of our improved comparable retail store sales, continued store expansion and the favorable impact of the strengthening Euro and Canadian dollar. Also contributing to the sales increase was the 53rd week in Fiscal 2004 compared to 52 weeks in Fiscal 2003. The 53rd week was responsible for an estimated $39.5 million of the sales increase. Further influencing the increase in net revenues were overall increases in licensing revenues driven by the incremental effect of the consolidation of revenues from the Japanese master license and improved results in the footwear business. Additionally, wholesale revenues increased as a result of the sale of Lauren products commencing in the third quarter of fiscal year 2004. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales in our wholesale business primarily driven by planned reductions in off price sales in our mens, womens and European business as well as the loss of the Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones. Net revenues for our business segments are provided below (Dollars in thousands). Fiscal Year Ended April 3, March 29, Increase 2004 2003 (Decrease) % Change Net revenues: Wholesale $ 1,210,397 $ 1,187,363 $ 23,034 1.9 % Retail 1,170,447 1,001,958 168,489 16.8 % Licensing 268,810 250,019 18,791 7.5 % Total Net Revenue $ 2,649,654 $ 2,439,340 $ 210,314 8.6 % Wholesale net sales increased primarily due to the addition of the Lauren line, which accounted for net sales of approximately $109.8 million in the current year partially offset by: a $60.4 million decrease in the domestic mens wholesale business, which resulted from a planned reduction in off price sales and a reduction in spring sales due to a planned reduction of sales to lower margin customers. the elimination of the womens Ralph Lauren Sport line, which accounted for net sales of approximately $12.3 million in the prior year. decreases in the European wholesale business, primarily due to the soft economic conditions in Europe, of approximately $65.4 million on a constant dollar basis, offset by a $45.1 million favorable impact due to a stronger Euro in the current period. 34 Table of Contents Retail net sales increased primarily as a result of: a $43.7 million, or 14.4%, increase in comparable full price store sales and a $48.8 million, or 7.6%, increase in comparable outlet store sales on a constant dollar basis. Excluding the extra week in Fiscal 2004, comparable store sales increased 12.2% and 5.7% in full price and outlet stores, respectively, on a constant dollar basis. Comparable store sales for the 53 weeks increased 18.0% and 8.8% for the full price stores and the outlet stores, respectively, while comparable store sales on a on a 52 week basis increased 15.8% for full price stores and 6.9% for outlet stores. Comparable store sales information includes both Ralph Lauren stores and Club Monaco stores. worldwide store expansion. During Fiscal 2004, the Company added 15 stores and closed 7 stores. Our total store count at April 3, 2004 was 263 stores compared to 255 stores at March 29, 2003. the stronger Euro and Canadian dollar in the current period, accounted for approximately $27.0 million of the increase in net sales. Licensing revenue increased primarily as a result of: a $27.5 million increase in international licensing primarily due to the incremental effect of the consolidation of revenues from the Japanese master license. $3.5 million increase in domestic licensing due to improvements in the footwear business. partially offset by the loss of $15.8 million of Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones compared to the prior year. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased $115.7 million, or 9.6%, for Fiscal 2004 compared to Fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of the increases discussed above. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 49.9% from 49.5%. This increase reflects a change in business mix, with retail sales representing 44.2% of revenues in Fiscal 2004 compared to 41.1% in Fiscal 2003 and improved margins in our Ralph Lauren and Club Monaco retail stores. The increasing gross profit rate also reflects higher realized sales dollars resulting from a combination of improved product mix as well as the benefits of advertising and targeted marketing. The rate improvement also reflects a continued focus on inventory management. Although our inventory balance at April 3, 2004 is approximately the same as it was at March 29, 2003, this primarily reflects the appreciation of the Euro, inventories related to our Lauren wholesale business and increased levels of inventory related to our retail growth offset by decreases in inventory in other lines of business. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A increased $125.2 million, or 13.8%, to $1.030 billion during Fiscal 2004 from $904.8 million during Fiscal 2003. SG&A as a percent of net revenues increased to 38.9% from 37.1%. The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by: Higher selling salaries and related costs of $43.4 million, exclusive of the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in connection with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion. Approximately $30.4 million of the increase in SG&A was due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the Euro and Canadian dollar in Fiscal 2004. Expenses of $28.1 million associated with the Lauren wholesale business, exclusive of additional corporate and overhead expenses incurred and reduced royalty revenues received. 35 Table of Contents $19.0 million of increased international licensing SG&A primarily due to the consolidation of incremental expenses in connection with the Japanese master license. Restructuring Charge. We recorded restructuring charges of $19.6 million during Fiscal 2004 compared to restructuring charges of $14.4 million during Fiscal 2003. The Fiscal 2004 restructuring charge is comprised of an additional $10.4 million for lease termination costs primarily associated with two Club Monaco retail properties included in our 2001 Operational Plan due to real estate market factors that were less favorable than originally estimated, $7.9 million for additional contract termination and severance costs related to the consolidation of our European business operations (approximately $6.7 million for the wholesale business and $1.2 million for the retail business) and $1.3 million for lease termination and asset write offs associated with the March 2004 decision to close our RRL stores. The Fiscal 2003 restructuring charge of $14.4 million related to severance and contract termination costs in connection with the consolidation of our European business operations. Income (Loss) from Operations. Income from operations decreased $14.6 million, or 5.1%, in Fiscal 2004 compared to Fiscal 2003. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in wholesale operating profits, restructuring charges, the decrease in Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones following the license termination in December 2003 and the start up expenses associated with the Lauren line. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the retail segments profits. Income from operations was not significantly impacted by the stronger Euro and Canadian dollar period because the increased sales resulting from exchange rate fluctuations were substantially offset by a comparable increase in expenses. Income from operations for our business segments are provided below (Dollars in thousands). Fiscal Year Ended April 3, March 29, Increase 2004 2003 (Decrease) % Change Income (Loss) from operations Wholesale $ 93,128 $ 124,476 $ (31,348 ) (25.2 %) Retail 72,915 40,366 32,549 80.6 % Licensing 127,319 138,018 (10,699 ) (7.8 %) 293,362 302,860 $ (9,498 ) (3.1 %) Less: Restructuring Charge (19,566 ) (14,443 ) Income from operations $ 273,796 $ 288,417 Wholesale operating income decreased primarily as a result of decreased net sales in our domestic mens business and European wholesale operations. The incremental effect of Lauren sales in the fourth quarter on our wholesale business income from operations was largely offset by start up and ordinary operating expenses associated with the Lauren wholesale business. Retail operating income increased primarily as a result of increased net sales and improved gross profits as a percentage of net revenues. These increases were partially offset by the increase in selling salaries and related costs in connection with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion. Licensing income decreased primarily due to the loss of the Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones. This decrease was partially offset by improvements in the footwear business and by the inclusion of the operations of the Japanese Master License. Foreign Currency (Gains) Losses. The effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss of $1.9 million during Fiscal 2004, compared to a $0.5 million loss during Fiscal 2003. These losses primarily related to transaction losses on unhedged inventory 36 Table of Contents purchases and royalty payments in Europe resulting from increases in the value of the Euro compared to the dollar. These losses are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are converted to U.S. dollars. In the prior period, these losses primarily related to transaction losses on the unhedged portion of our Euro denominated debt caused by appreciation of the Euro until we entered into the cross currency swap in June 2002, which were partially offset by $1.3 million of gains recorded on the Japanese forward contracts that we entered into in November of 2002. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $10.0 million in Fiscal 2004 from $13.5 million for Fiscal 2003. This decrease was due to the repayment of approximately $100.0 million of short term borrowings during Fiscal 2004, as well as decreased interest rates as a result of the May 2003 interest rate swap described in Liquidity and Capital Resources Derivative Instruments. Provision for Income Taxes. The effective tax rate was 36.3% for Fiscal 2004 compared to 36.5% for Fiscal 2003. Other (Income) Expense, Net. Other (income) expense, net was $(4.1) million for Fiscal 2004. This reflects $5.5 million of income related to the 20% equity interest in the company that holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan, net of $1.4 million of minority interest expense associated with our Japanese master license, both of which were acquired in February 2003 (except for the additional 2% equity interest in the entity that holds the sublicenses that we acquired in May 2003). Net Income. Net income decreased for Fiscal 2004 to $171.0 million from $174.2 million for Fiscal 2003, or 6.5% and 7.1% of net revenues, respectively. Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis decreased by $0.07 to $1.69 per share as a result of the decrease in net income for the reasons previously discussed and an increase in diluted shares outstanding of 1.7 million due to the exercise of stock options, a higher average stock price and the award of restricted stock units to executives. Fiscal 2003 Compared to Fiscal 2002 Net Sales. Net sales for Fiscal 2003 were $2.189 billion, an increase of $67.0 million, or 3.2%, over net sales for Fiscal 2002. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year ended March 30, 2002, net sales would have been $2.094 billion resulting in a current fiscal year increase of 4.6%. Net sales results by segment were as follows (Dollars in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended March 29, March 30, Increase 2003 2002 (Decrease) % Change Net revenues: Wholesale $ 1,187,363 $ 1,198,060 $ (10,697 ) (0.9 %) Retail 1,001,958 924,273 77,685 8.4 % Licensing 250,019 241,374 8,645 3.6 % Total Net Revenue $ 2,439,340 $ 2,363,707 $ 75,633 3.2 % Wholesale net sales decreased $10.7 million, or 0.9%, to $1.187 billion for Fiscal 2003 from $1.198 billion in Fiscal 2002. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year ended March 30, 2002, wholesale net sales would have 37 Table of Contents been $1.164 billion and the increase would have been 2.0%. The increase primarily resulted from the following: Increases in the European wholesale business of $66.4 million, exclusive of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which resulted primarily from continued European expansion and the inclusion of PRL Fashions operations for the full year, as well as; $38.9 million from the favorable impact of Euro currency fluctuation, partially offset by a strategic streamlining of the amount of product sold to the department stores and: the elimination of the womens Ralph Lauren Sport and the Lauren for Men lines which contributed a decrease of $70.2 million. Retail net sales increased $77.7 million, or 8.4%, to $1.002 billion for Fiscal 2003 from $924.3 million in Fiscal 2002. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year ended March 30, 2002, retail net sales would have been $929.4 million, resulting in a $72.5 million increase. This increase was primarily driven by the following: a $49.4 million, or 8.4%, increase in comparable outlet store sales, partially offset by $7.1 million, or 2.3%, decrease in our total full price stores (comparable store sales information includes both Polo Ralph Lauren stores and Club Monaco stores). a $9.9 million increase as a result of the favorable impact of Euro currency fluctuation. $30 million of the increase was due to worldwide store expansion. The Company opened 19 stores, net of closings during the year, ending the period with 255 stores as compared to 236 stores in the prior year. Included in these openings were 11 Polo Ralph Lauren stores, seven Club Monaco stores (including two Club Monaco Caban Home stores), and seven outlet stores (including one full line outlet store, one Polo Jeans outlet store and five European outlet stores). Offsetting these openings were the closings of three outlet stores (including two full line outlet stores and one Polo Jeans outlet store), two Club Monaco stores and one Club Monaco outlet store. Licensing Revenue. Licensing revenue increased approximately $8.6 million, or 3.6%, to $250.0 million in Fiscal 2003. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year ended March 30, 2002, licensing revenue would have been $237.4 million, resulting in a 5.3%, or $12.6 million, increase primarily driven by increased revenues from our international and product licensing partners of approximately $4.2 million and $8.5 million, respectively. Gross Profit. Gross profit dollars increased $60.8 million, or 5.3%, in Fiscal 2003 over Fiscal 2002. Gross profits as a percent of net sales increased to 49.5% in 2003 from 48.5% in 2002. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year ended March 30, 2002, gross profit percentage would have been 48.2%. The increase in gross profit rate reflected improved product performance and merchandise margins in the domestic retail businesses, partially offset by a small reduction in wholesale margins. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased $67.2 million, or 8.0%, to $904.8 million in Fiscal 2003 from $837.6 million, as compared to Fiscal 2002. These expenses as a percent of net sales increased to 37.1% in 2003 from 35.4% in 2002. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year ended March 30, 2002, SG&A expenses would have been $845.0 million, or 36.3% of net revenues. The increase in Fiscal 2003 was primarily due to higher selling salaries and related costs in connection with the incremental increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion, the expansion of the European wholesale business, the inclusion of PRL Fashions operations, which was acquired in October 2002, as well as the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily the strengthening of the Euro. These increases were offset by the elimination of goodwill amortization of $9.1 million as a result of the 38 Table of Contents implementation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and the recording of a gain of approximately $5.0 million related to an assignment of the sub lease for one store location. Restructuring Charge. During Fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic review of our European businesses and formalized our plans to centralize and more efficiently consolidate our operations. The major initiatives of our plan included the following: consolidation of our headquarters from five cities in three countries to one location; the consolidation of our European logistics operations to Italy; and the migration of all European information systems to a standard global system. We have completed the consultation process for consolidation of the headquarters and anticipate completion of the consolidation and migration during Fiscal 2004. In connection with the implementation of this plan, the Company recorded a total $14.4 million restructuring charge (approximately $12.3 million for the wholesale business and $2.1 million for the retail business). During Fiscal 2002, the Company recorded a $16.0 million restructuring charge for additional lease termination costs associated with the closure of our retail stores. Operating Income. Operating income decreased $6.4 million or 2.1% from fiscal 2002 as follows (Dollars in thousands): For the Year Ended March 29, March 30, Increase 2003 2002 (Decrease) % Change Income (Loss) from operations: Wholesale $ 124,476 $ 158,401 $ (33,925 ) (21.4 %) Retail 40,366 18,799 21,567 114.7 % Licensing 138,018 132,012 6,006 4.6 % 302,860 309,212 $ (6,352 ) (2.1 %) Less: Restructuring Charge (14,443 ) (16,000 ) Income from operations $ 288,417 $ 293,212 Wholesale operating income decreased $33.9 million or 21.4% from fiscal 2002. Had certain of the European subsidiaries been reported on a consistent fiscal year basis for the year end March 30, 2002, wholesale operating income would have increased as a result of the increases in sales as previously discussed and lower operating expenses. Retail operating income increased $21.6 million or 114.7% primarily as a result of the sales increases discussed earlier as well as improved gross margin rates. Licensing income increased $6.0 million or 4.6% primarily as a result of the sales increases discussed previously. Foreign Currency Losses (Gains). The effect of foreign currency decreased to a loss of $0.5 million in Fiscal 2003, compared to a $1.8 million gain in Fiscal 2002. These gains are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are converted to U.S. dollars. In Fiscal 2003, these losses primarily related to approximately $3.2 million of transaction losses on the unhedged portion of our Euro debt in the first quarter of the fiscal year, which resulted from increases in the Eurodollar rate until we entered into the cross currency swap in June 2002. These losses were partially offset by $2.4 million of gains realized on the Japanese forward contracts, which we further describe in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. In Fiscal 2002, the gains were derived from transaction gains on the unhedged portion of our Euro debt, which resulted from decreases in the Eurodollar rate. 39 Table of Contents Interest Expense, Net. Interest expense decreased to $13.5 million in Fiscal 2003 from $19.0 million in Fiscal 2002. This decrease was primarily due to decreased short term borrowings and long term Euro borrowings during Fiscal 2003. Approximately $2.9 million of the decrease resulted from reduced interest rates as a result of the cross currency swap, which was entered into in connection with our Euro debt in June 2002 and is further described in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section. The remaining decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates, during the fiscal year ended March 29, 2003. These decreases were partially offset by higher Eurodollar exchange rates, which affect the Euro denominated interest payments on the portion of the Euro debt not covered by the cross currency swap. Provision for Income Taxes. Our tax provision for Fiscal 2003 was $100.2 million as compared to $103.5 million in Fiscal 2002, a 36.5% and 37.5% effective tax rate, respectively. This decline is the result of the implementation of tax strategies. Net Income. Net income increased in Fiscal 2003 to $174.2 million from $172.5 million in Fiscal 2002, or 7.1% and 7.3% of net revenues, respectively. Diluted earnings per common share was $1.76 and $1.75 for Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002, respectively. The change in diluted earnings per share resulted from the $1.7 million increase in Net income partially offset by a 0.7 million increase in the number of shares outstanding primarily as a result of the exercise of stock options and additional restricted shares. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund growth in working capital (primarily accounts receivable and inventory) to support projected sales increases, construction and renovation of shop within shops, investment in the technological upgrading of our distribution centers and information systems, expenditures related to retail store expansion, acquisitions, dividends, and other corporate activities, including the start up costs of bringing the Lauren and Ralph lines in house. Sources of liquidity to fund ongoing and future cash requirements include cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, credit facilities and other borrowings. Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 We ended Fiscal 2004 with $343.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $277.3 million of debt outstanding compared to $343.6 million and $349.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and debt outstanding, respectively, at March 29, 2003. This represents a $72.0 million increase in our cash net of debt position over the last twelve months which is primarily attributable to the following factors: (i) reduced spending on acquisitions and investments, (ii) increased proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, (iii) partially offset by reduced cash flows from operations and an increase in Euro debt of $28.9 million as a result of the strengthening of the Euro. Additionally, capital expenditures were $123.0 million for Fiscal 2004 compared to $98.7 million in Fiscal 2003. As of April 3, 2004, we had $277.3 million outstanding in long term Euro debt based on the year end Euro exchange rate, an increase of $28.9 million from Fiscal 2003. The increase was entirely due to changes in the Euro to Dollar exchange rate. We were also contingently liable for $35.3 million in outstanding letters of credit primarily related to commitments for the purchase of inventory. The weighted average interest rate on our borrowings at April 3, 2004 was 3.8%. Accounts receivable increased $65.9 million primarily as a result of the inception of sales under the Lauren label and the strengthening of the Euro. $86.5 million of the increase was due to Lauren and $13.2 million was due to the change in the value of the Euro. These increases were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable in our other wholesale divisions resulting from sales decreases and the timing of payments. 40 Table of Contents Inventories decreased $0.1 million in Fiscal 2004. The inception of the Lauren line was responsible for a $34.1 million increase and the strengthening of the Euro caused a $14.3 million increase in inventory. These increases were more than offset by reductions in inventory in our Retail and Mens wholesale business as a result of improvements in our supply chain forecasting and management and reduced inventory requirements in our mens business as a result of planned reductions in sales. Other current assets increased $37.2 million from Fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of increases in European Value Added Tax receivables and the effect of the timing of the Fiscal year end on prepaid items. Accounts payable increased $6.0 million compared to Fiscal 2003 primarily as result of the addition of the Lauren line partially offset by reductions in our mens line due to a decrease in inventory purchases and reductions in Europe due to the timing of year end invoice receipts. Accrued expenses increased $71.7 million primarily as a result of the addition of the Lauren label, increases in the European Value Added Tax payable, and increases in Europe due to the timing of year end invoice receipts. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $210.6 million during Fiscal 2004 compared to $269.0 million in Fiscal 2003. This $58.4 million decrease in cash flow was driven primarily by the year over year changes in working capital described above and the decrease in net income of $3.2 million. During Fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic review of our European business and formalized our plans to centralize and more efficiently consolidate its business operations. In connection with the implementation of this plan, we had total cash outlays of approximately $13.3 million during the year ended April 3, 2004. We also had cash outlays of $8.3 million during Fiscal 2004 in connection with our 2001 restructuring plan, primarily related to lease termination costs. It is expected that the remaining liabilities of both plans will be paid throughout Fiscal 2005. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $132.7 million in Fiscal 2004 as compared to $166.3 million in Fiscal 2003. Both the Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003 net cash used primarily reflected capital expenditures related to retail expansion and upgrading our systems and facilities, as well as shop within shop expenditures. The Fiscal 2004 net cash used also reflects $5.4 million for an additional 2% equity interest in the company that holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan, an additional $3.5 million primarily for additional transaction costs to acquire a 50% interest in the Japanese master license, $1.0 million for an additional payment on the first earn out payment calculation in connection with the PRL Fashions of Europe SRL acquisition and $7.5 million for the acquisition of a license for the use of trademarks in November 2003. Fiscal 2003 net cash used, reflects $78 million primarily for the acquisition of a 50% interest in the Japanese Master license and an 18% equity interest in the company holding the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens, and jeans business in Japan. Our anticipated capital expenditures for Fiscal 2005 approximate $143.0 million. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $76.4 million in Fiscal 2004 compared to $16.7 million in Fiscal 2003. Cash used in financing activities during Fiscal 2004, consisted of the net repayment of short term borrowings of $100.9 million and the payment of $14.8 million in dividends, partially offset by proceeds of $40.4 million from the exercise of stock options. Cash used during Fiscal 2003 primarily consisted of net borrowings of $19.7 million and repurchases of common stock totaling $4.7 million, partially offset by $7.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 41 Table of Contents Fiscal 2003 compared to Fiscal 2002 We ended Fiscal 2003 with $343.6 million in cash and equivalents and $349.4 million of debt outstanding compared to $244.7 million and $318.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and debt outstanding, respectively, at March 30, 2002. This represents a $67.8 million improvement in our debt net of cash position and was primarily attributable to changes in working capital due to the factors discussed below, partially offset by approximately $73.0 million of purchase price payments connected with our acquisition of a 50% interest in the Japanese master license and an 18% equity interest in the company which holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan. Capital expenditures were $98.7 million for Fiscal 2003, compared to $88.0 million in Fiscal 2002. We acquired several retail locations from certain of our licensees in Belgium, Germany and Argentina for a total purchase price of approximately $4.6 million. As of March 29, 2003, we had $100.9 million outstanding in short term bank borrowings, of which $50.0 million was repaid in April 2003 with the remainder repaid in June 2003. Additionally, we had $248.5 million outstanding in long term Euro debt based on the quarter end Euro exchange rate. We were also contingently liable for $19.1 million in outstanding letters of credit primarily related to commitments for the purchase of inventory. The weighted average interest rate on our borrowings at March 29, 2003 was 5.4%. Accounts receivable increased to $375.8 million, or 6.3% at March 29, 2003 compared to $353.6 million at March 30, 2002 due to the timing of shipments. Approximately $23.0 million of the increase resulted from currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily the strengthening of the Euro. Improvements were made in our days sales outstanding, however, the incremental effect of these improvements was offset by the additional royalty receivables recorded in Fiscal 2003 compared to Fiscal 2002. Inventories increased $14.0 million, or 4.0%, at the end of Fiscal 2003 compared to the end of Fiscal 2002. This increase reflects the build up of certain inventory for European retail stores as part of our continued expansion. Additionally an increase of $23.7 million resulted from currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily the strengthening of the Euro. These increases were partially offset by decreases in other business lines. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $269.0 million during 2003 compared to $299.7 million in 2002. This $30.7 million decrease in cash flow was driven primarily by year over year changes in accounts receivable, inventories, prepaid expenses and accounts payable. During Fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic review of our European business and formalized our plans to centralize and more efficiently consolidate its business operations. In connection with the implementation of this plan, we recorded a restructuring charge of $14.4 million and had total cash outlays of approximately $3.8 million during the year ended March 29, 2003. During Fiscal 2001 and 1999 we implemented two plans: the 2001 Operational Plan and 1999 Restructuring Plan. Total cash outlays related to the 2001 Operational Plan and 1999 Restructuring Plan were $9.8 million and $2.7 million, respectively for, Fiscal 2003. As of March 29, 2003, we settled all remaining liabilities related to the 1999 Restructuring Plan. In May 2003, we settled $4.6 million of the remaining $5.2 million in liabilities related to the 2001 Operational Plan, the remaining $0.6 million was settled in Fiscal 2004. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities increased to $166.3 million in Fiscal 2003, as compared to $116.0 million in Fiscal 2002. Both the Fiscal 2003 and Fiscal 2002 net cash used primarily reflected shop within shops and other capital expenditures related to retail expansion and upgrading our systems and facilities. The fiscal 2003 net cash used also reflects $78.0 million primarily for our acquisition of a 50% interest in the 42 Table of Contents Japanese master license and an 18% equity interest in the company which holds the sublicense for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens, and jeans business in Japan. Fiscal 2002 net cash used reflects $23.7 million for the acquisition of PRL Fashions. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $16.7 million in Fiscal 2003 compared to $40.3 million in Fiscal 2002. This change is primarily due to the net repayment of short term debt of $12.0 million, the repurchase of $7.7 million of our Euro debt and the repurchase of our common stock of $4.7 million, offset by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $7.7 million for Fiscal 2003; compared to $52.2 million of short term debt repayment, $10.6 million of Euro debt repurchases, $2.1 million of common stock repurchases offset by the proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $24.5 million in Fiscal 2002. In March 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, subject to market conditions, of up to $100.0 million of our Class A common stock. Share repurchases were to be made in the open market over a two year period, which commenced April 1, 1998. The Board of Directors has extended the stock repurchase program through April 1, 2006. Shares acquired under the repurchase program will be used for stock option programs and for other corporate purposes. As of April 3, 2004, we had repurchased 4.1 million shares of our Class A common stock at an aggregate cost of $77.5 million. As of April 3, 2004, we had approximately $21.0 million remaining in our stock repurchase program. In November 1999, we issued Euro 275.0 million of 6.125% notes due November 2006. Our Euro debt is listed on the London Stock Exchange. The net proceeds from the Euro offering were $281.5 million, based on the Euro exchange rate on the issuance date. Interest on the Euro debt is payable annually. A portion of these net proceeds was used to acquire Poloco S.A.S.(our principal European subsidiary) and the remaining net proceeds were retained for general corporate purposes. Through Fiscal 2004, we repurchased Euro 47.7 million, or $43.6 million, based on Euro exchange rates at the time of repurchase of our outstanding Euro debt. In November 2002, we terminated both our 1997 bank credit facility and our 1999 senior bank credit facility and entered into a new credit facility. The 1997 bank credit facility provided for a $225.0 million revolving line of credit and matured on December 31, 2002, while the 1999 senior bank credit facility consisted of a $20.0 million revolving line of credit and an $80.0 million term loan, both of which were scheduled to mature on June 30, 2003. The new credit facility is with a syndicate of banks and consists of a $300.0 million revolving line of credit, subject to increase to $375.0 million, which is available for direct borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit. It will mature on November 18, 2005. As of April 3, 2004, we had no debt outstanding under the new facility. Borrowings under this facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to (i) the higher of the Federal Funds Effective Rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus 1/2 of one percent, and the prime commercial lending rate of JP Morgan Chase Bank in effect from time to time, or (ii) the LIBO Rate (as defined) in effect from time to time, as adjusted for the Federal Reserve Boards Eurocurrency Liabilities maximum reserve percentages, and a margin based on our then current credit ratings. Our 2002 bank credit facility requires that we maintain certain covenants: a minimum consolidated tangible net worth, and a maximum of Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR (as such terms are defined in the credit facility) ratio. The credit facility also contains covenants that, subject to specified exceptions, restrict our ability to: incur additional debt; incur liens and contingent liabilities; 43 Table of Contents sell or dispose of our assets, including equity interests; merge with or acquire other companies, liquidate or dissolve; engage in businesses that are not a related line of business; make loans, advances or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make investments. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the credit facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the credit facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The credit facility specifies a number of events of default, many of which are subject to applicable grace or cure periods, including, among others, the failure to make timely principal and interest payments, to satisfy the covenants, or to maintain the required financial performance requirements described above. Additionally, the agreement provides that an event of default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren and related entities fail to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power of our common stock. As of April 3, 2004, the Company was in compliance with all financial and non financial debt covenants. In Fiscal 2003, the Board of Directors initiated a dividend program consisting of quarterly cash dividends of $0.05 per outstanding share, or $0.20 per outstanding share on an annual basis, on our common stock. Dividends of $0.05 per outstanding share declared to stockholders of record at the close of business on June 27, 2003, September 26, 2003, December 26, 2003 and April 2, 2004 were paid on July 11, 2003, October 10, 2003, January 9, 2003 and April 16, 2004, respectively. We believe that cash from ongoing operations and funds available under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations, capital requirements, the stock repurchase program, cash dividends and other corporate activities for the next twelve months.

In June 2002, we entered into a cross currency rate swap which was scheduled to terminate in November 2006. The cross currency rate swap converted 105.2 million, 6.125% fixed rate borrowings into $100.0 million, LIBOR plus 1.24% variable rate borrowings. We entered into the cross currency rate swap to minimize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on both principal and interest payments on our long term Euro debt, and to minimize the impact of changes in the fair value of the Euro debt due to changes in LIBOR, the benchmark interest rate. The swap was designated as a fair value hedge under SFAS No. 133. Hedge ineffectiveness was measured as the difference between the respective 44 Table of Contents gains or losses recognized in earnings from the changes in the fair value of the cross currency rate swap and the Euro debt. In May 2003, we terminated the cross currency rate swap and entered into an interest rate swap that will terminate in November 2006. The interest rate swap is being used to convert 105.2 million, 6.125% fixed rate borrowings into 105.2 million, EURIBOR minus 1.55% variable rate borrowings. We entered into the interest rate swap to minimize the impact of changes in the fair value of the Euro debt due to changes in EURIBOR, the benchmark interest rate. The swap had been designated as a fair value hedge under SFAS No. 133. Hedge ineffectiveness is measured as the difference between the respective gains or losses recognized in earnings from the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and the Euro debt resulting from changes in the benchmark interest rate, and was de minimis for Fiscal 2004. In addition, we have designated the entire principal of the Euro debt as a hedge of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary. As a result, changes in the fair value of the Euro debt resulting from changes in the Euro rate are reported net of income taxes in Accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements as an unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency hedges. On April 6, 2004 we executed an interest rate swap to convert the fixed interest rate on Euro 50 million of the Eurobonds to a floating rate (EURIBOR based). After the execution of this swap, approximately Euro 77 million of the Eurobonds remained at a fixed interest rate. We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts as hedges relating to identifiable currency positions to reduce our risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inventory and intercompany royalty payments. Gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized as adjustments to either the basis of those assets or foreign exchange gains/ losses, as applicable. At April 3, 2004, we had the following foreign exchange contracts outstanding: (i) to deliver Euro 67.1 million in exchange for $73.9 million through Fiscal 2005 and (ii) to deliver 8,248 million Japanese Yen in exchange for $71.0 million through Fiscal 2008. At April 3, 2004, the fair value of these contracts resulted in unrealized losses, net of taxes of $6.6 million and $6.3 million, for the Euro forward contracts and Japanese Yen forward contracts, respectively. To the extent that any derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, they are recorded at fair value, with all gains or losses recognized immediately in the current period earnings. In November 2002, we entered into forward contracts on 6.2 billion Japanese Yen that terminated in February 2003. While these transactions do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, we entered into these forward contracts to minimize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the Japanese Yen denominated purchase price described in the agreements related to the purchase of a 50% interest in the Japanese master license and an 18% equity interest in the company which holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan, which were consummated during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003. We recognized $2.4 million of foreign currency gains on this transaction, which are recorded in foreign currency losses(gains) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We recognize foreign currency gains or losses in connection with our Euro debt and certain short term foreign currency contracts based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. In connection with recording these contracts at fair market value, we recognized $1.9 million in foreign currency losses in Fiscal 2004, and $0.5 million in Fiscal 2003 included as a component of foreign currency losses (gains) in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. The Company does not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or unconsolidated special purpose entities. 45 Table of Contents Seasonality of Business Our business is affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments to retail customers and key vacation travel and holiday shopping periods in the retail segment. As a result of the growth in our retail operations and licensing revenue, historical quarterly operating trends and working capital requirements may not be indicative of future performances. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. Fiscal 2002 reflects the change in the fiscal year end of certain of our European subsidiaries as reported in our consolidated financial statements. See Consolidation of European Entities Change in Reporting Period. In connection with our acquisition of a 50% interest in the Japanese master license and the 18% (later increased to 20%) equity interest in the company which holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan, results for these operations are reflected in our consolidated financial statements for Fiscal 2004. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting policies employed by the Company, including the use of estimates, are presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report of Form 10 K. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and the results of operations, and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgments as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Companys most critical accounting policies, discussed below, pertain to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill, other long lived intangible assets, income taxes, accrued expenses and derivative instruments. In applying such policies, management must use some amounts that are based upon its informed judgments and best estimates. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgements and available information. The estimates that we make are based upon historical factors, current circumstances and the experience and judgment of our management. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations. Changes in such estimates, based on more accurate future information, may affect amounts reported in future periods. We are not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances which would result in different amounts being reported that would materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. Revenue Recognition Wholesale sales are recognized when the title and risk of loss passes to the customer and are recorded net of returns, discounts and allowances. Returns and allowances require pre approval from management. Discounts are based on trade terms. Estimates for end of season allowances are based on historic trends, seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic conditions and retailer performance. The Companys historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. Sales by our retail and outlet stores are recognized when 46 Table of Contents goods are sold to consumers, net of returns. Licensing revenue is recognized based upon shipment of licensed products sold by our licensees, net of allowances. Accounts Receivable, Net In the normal course of business, we extend credit to customers, who satisfy pre defined credit criteria. Accounts receivable, net, as shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is net of allowances and anticipated discounts. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the financial statements, assessments of collectibility based on historic trends, the financial condition of our customers and an evaluation of the economic conditions. Costs associated with potential returns of products as well as allowable customer markdowns and operational chargebacks, net of the expected recoveries, are included as a reduction to net sales and are part of the provision for allowances included in accounts receivable, net. These provisions result from divisional seasonal negotiations, as well as historic deduction trends net of expected recoveries and an evaluation of current market conditions. Should circumstances change or economic or distribution channel conditions deteriorate significantly, we may need to increase these provisions. Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost First in, First out, (FIFO), method, or market. We continually evaluate the composition of our inventories assessing slow turning, ongoing product as well as prior seasons fashion product. Market value of distressed inventory is determined based on historical sales trends for the category of inventory involved, the impact of market trends and economic conditions. Estimates may differ from actual results due to quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions. We review our inventory position on a quarterly basis at a minimum and adjust our estimates based on revised projections and current market conditions. If economic conditions worsen, we incorrectly anticipate trends or unexpected events occur, our estimates could be proven overly optimistic, and required adjustments could materially adversely affect future results of operations. The Companys historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. Goodwill, Other Intangibles and Long Lived Assets Effective March 31, 2002, we adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 142 requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer are to be amortized, but rather be tested at least annually for impairment. This pronouncement also requires that intangible assets with definite lives continue to be amortized over their respective lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase cost over the fair value of net assets of businesses acquired. Before adopting the provisions of SFAS No. 142, we amortized goodwill on a straight line basis over its estimated useful life, ranging from 11 to 40 years. Beginning in Fiscal 2003, consistent with the requirements of SFAS No. 142, we no longer amortize goodwill. The Company reviews goodwill annually for impairment. In addition, trademarks that are owned, that have been deemed to have indefinite lives, are reviewed at least annually for potential value impairment. Trademarks that are licensed by the Company from third parties are amortized over the individual terms of the respective license agreement, which approximates 10 years. Goodwill amortization expense was $9.1 million in Fiscal 2002. Accumulated goodwill amortization was $23.7 million at March 30, 2002. 47 Table of Contents We assess the carrying value of long lived and intangible assets, with finite lives, as current facts and circumstances indicate that they may be impaired. In evaluating the fair value and future benefits of all intangible assets, we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the individual assets over the remaining amortization period and would recognize an impairment loss if the carrying value exceeded the expected future cash flows. The impairment loss would be measured based upon the difference between the fair value of the asset and its recorded carrying value. See Note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for long lived and intangible asset writedowns recorded in connection with our Fiscal 2001 Operational Plan and Fiscal 1999 Restructuring Plan. During Fiscal 2004, there were no material impairment losses recorded in connection with this analysis. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. In accordance with this statement, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis, as measured by enacted tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the periods when the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be settled or realized. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provisions for income taxes. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. It is our policy to establish provisions for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities. We establish the provisions based upon managements assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences, tax credits and interest expense applied to temporary difference adjustments. The tax provisions are analyzed periodically (at least annually) and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustments to those provisions. Accrued Expenses Accrued expenses for employee insurance, workers compensation, profit sharing, contracted advertising, professional fees and other outstanding Company obligations are assessed based on claims experience and statistical trends, open contractual obligations, and estimates based on projections and current requirements. If these trends change significantly, then actual results would likely be impacted. Our historical estimates of these costs and our provisions have not differed materially from actual results. Derivative Instruments SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted, requires that each derivative instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability and measured at its fair value. The statement also requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings in either income (loss) from continuing operations or Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), depending on whether the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. We use foreign currency forward contracts for the specific purpose of hedging the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows associated primarily with inventory purchases mainly for our European businesses, royalty payments from our Japanese licensee, and other specific activities. These instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and, in accordance with SFAS No. 133, to the extent the hedges are highly effective, the changes in fair value are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of related tax effects, with the corresponding asset or liability recorded in the balance sheet. The ineffective portion of the cash flow hedge, if any, is recognized in current period earnings. Amounts recorded in Accumulated 48 Table of Contents other comprehensive income are reflected in current period earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If the relative values of the currencies involved in the hedging activities were to move dramatically, such movement could have a significant impact on our results of operations. We are not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances which would result in different amounts being reported that would materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. Hedge accounting requires that at the beginning of each hedge period, we justify an expectation that the hedge will be highly effective. This effectiveness assessment involves an estimation of the probability of the occurrence of transactions for cash flow hedges. The use of different assumptions and changing market conditions may impact the results of the effectiveness assessment and ultimately the timing of when changes in derivative fair values and underlying hedged items are recorded in earnings. We hedge our net investment position in subsidiaries which conduct business in Euros by borrowing directly in foreign currency and designating a portion of our Euro denominated debt as a hedge of net investments. Under SFAS No. 133, changes in the fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in foreign currency translation, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. Inflation The rate of inflation over the past few years has not had a significant impact on our sales or profitability. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to Our Consolidated Financial Statements. Alternative Accounting Methods In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. The Companys significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options and inventories. Two alternative methods for accounting for stock options are available, the intrinsic value method and the fair value method. The Company uses the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options, and accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized. Under the fair value method, the determination of the pro forma amounts involves several assumptions including option life and future volatility. If the fair value method were used, diluted earnings per share for Fiscal 2004 would decrease approximately 10%. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Two alternative methods for accounting for wholesale inventories are the First In, First Out (FIFO) method and the Last in, First out (LIFO) method. The Company accounts for all wholesale inventories under the FIFO method. Two alternative methods for accounting for retail inventories are the retail method and the cost method. The Company accounts for all retail inventories under the cost method. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In December, 2003, The Securities Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (SAB 104), Revenue Recognition. SAB 104 expands previously issued guidance on the subject of Revenue Recognition and provides specific criteria which must be fulfilled to permit the recognition of revenue from transactions. The Company does not expect the issuance of SAB 104 to have a material effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial position. 49 Table of Contents In May 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity. This statement requires that certain financial instruments that, under previous guidance, could be accounted for as equity be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position. Most of the guidance in SFAS No. 150 is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003 and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 did not have a material effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial position. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, except as for the provisions that relate to SFAS No. 133 implementation issues that have been effective for fiscal quarters that began prior to June 15, 2003, which should continue to be applied in accordance with their respective effective dates. The adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial position. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. This statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements for SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation. SFAS No. 148 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 31, 2002. The Company does not intend to expense stock options; therefore the adoption of this statement did not have any impact on the consolidated financial position or results of operations. In June 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement required companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs covered by SFAS No. 146 include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing, or exit or disposal activity. SFAS No. 146 is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002. The Company has adopted the provisions of SFAS No. 146. In January 2003, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities which was amended by FIN46R in December, 2003. A variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. Historically, entities generally were not consolidated unless the entity was controlled through voting interests. FIN 46R changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. FIN 46R also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46R apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46R apply to existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after December 15, 2003. Also, certain disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity 50 Table of Contents was established. The adoption of FIN 46R did not have a material impact on the consolidated results of operations or financial position of the company. See Note 3 to our Consolidated Financial Statements regarding our interest in Ralph Lauren Media, LLC. In November 2002, the FASB issued FIN 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value and requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures, even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote. Generally, FIN 45 applies to certain types of financial guarantees that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entitys failure to perform under an obligation agreement; indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to an indemnified party based on changes in an underlying that is related to an asset, liability or an equity security of the indemnified party; or indirect guarantees of the indebtedness of others. The initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Disclosure requirements under FIN 45 are effective for financial statements ending after December 15, 2002, and are applicable to all guarantees issued by the guarantor subject under FIN 45s scope, including guarantees issued prior to FIN 45. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial position. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Our policy allows for the use of derivative financial instruments for identifiable market risk exposures, including interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. During Fiscal 2004, there were significant fluctuations in the value of the Euro to Dollar exchange rate. In June 2002, we entered into a cross currency rate swap to minimize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the long term Euro debt and the impact of fluctuations in the interest rate on the fair value of the long term Euro debt. In May 2003, we terminated the cross currency rate swap, and entered into an interest rate swap, to minimize the impact of changes in the fair value of the Euro debt due to changes in EURIBOR, the benchmark interest rate. The following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices and theoretical pricing models obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities. These quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We have assets and liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies related to international subsidiaries. At April 3, 2004, we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts in Europe and Japan to purchase $144.9 million U.S. dollars through March 2004. We believe that these financial instruments should not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should offset losses and gains on the assets, liabilities, and transactions being hedged. We are exposed to credit related losses if the counterparty to the financial instruments fails to perform its obligations. However, we do not expect the counterparty, which presently has high credit ratings, to fail to meet its obligations. 51 Table of Contents Our primary foreign currency exposure relates to our Euro debt. As of April 3, 2004, the fair value of our fixed Euro debt was $292.6 million, based on its quoted market price as listed on the London Stock exchange and translated using Euro exchange rates in effect as of April 3, 2004. The potential increase in fair value of our fixed rate Euro debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in exchange rates would have been approximately $29.3 million at April 3, 2004. As of April 3, 2004, a hypothetical immediate 10% adverse change in exchange rates would have had a $1.8 million unfavorable impact over a one year period on our earnings and cash flows. Interest Rates Our primary interest rate exposure relates to our fixed rate debt. The potential increase in fair value of our fixed rate Euro debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates would have been approximately $4.1 million at April 3, 2004. We employ a fair value hedging strategy utilizing interest rate swaps to effectively float a portion of our interest rate exposure on our fixed rate Euro debt. On April 6, 2004, the company executed an interest rate swap to convert the fixed interest rate on 50 million of the Eurobonds to a floating rate. After the execution of this swap, approximately 77 million of Eurobonds remained at fixed interest rate.
