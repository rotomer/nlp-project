Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis is a summary and should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We use a 52 53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest March 31. References to Fiscal 2005 represent the 52 week fiscal year ended April 2, 2005. References to Fiscal 2004 represent the 53 week fiscal year ended April 3, 2004, and references to Fiscal 2003 represent the 52 week fiscal year ended March 29, 2003. Overview We operate in three integrated segments: wholesale, retail and licensing. Wholesale consists of womens, mens and childrens apparel. Teams comprising design, merchandising, sales and production staff work together to develop product groupings that are organized to convey a variety of design concepts. This segment includes the Polo Ralph Lauren product lines as well as Lauren, Blue Label, Polo Golf, RLX Polo Sport, Womens Ralph Lauren Collection and Black Label, and Mens Purple Label Collection. Retail consists of our worldwide Ralph Lauren retail operations that sell our product through Ralph Lauren, Club Monaco full price and outlet stores and Rugby full price stores as well as Ralph Lauren Media, our 50% owned e commerce joint venture, which sells product over the Internet. Licensing consists of product, international and home licensing alliances, each of which pay us royalties based upon sales of our product, and are generally subject to minimum royalty payments. We work closely with our licensing partners to ensure that products are developed, marketed and distributed in a manner consistent with the distinctive perspective and lifestyle associated with our brand. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements We have restated our prior years financial statements for the following items. As a result of the clarifications contained in the February 7, 2005 letter from the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to the Center for Public Company Audit Firms of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants regarding certain specific lease accounting issues, we initiated a review of the Companys lease accounting practices. Management and the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors determined that our accounting practices were incorrect with respect to rent holiday periods and the classification of landlord incentives and the related amortization. We have made all appropriate adjustments to correct these errors for all periods presented. In periods prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we had recorded straight line rent expense for store operating leases over the related stores lease term beginning with the commencement date of store operations. Rent expense was not recognized during any build out period. To correct this practice, we have adopted a policy in which rent expense is recognized on a straight line over the stores lease term commencing with the start of the build out period (the effective lease commencement date). The adoption of this policy resulted in a reduction in operating income of $2.9 million for Fiscal 2004 and a $2.4 million increase in operating income for Fiscal 2003. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we had classified tenant allowances (amounts received from a landlord to fund leasehold improvement) as a reduction of property and equipment rather than as a deferred lease incentive liability. The amortization of these landlord incentives was originally recorded as a reduction in depreciation expense rather than as a reduction of rent expense. In addition, our statements of cash flow had originally reflected these incentives as a reduction of capital expenditures within cash flows from investing activities rather than as cash flows from operating activities. Correcting these items resulted in an increase to each of net property and equipment and deferred lease incentive liabilities of $11.4 million and $20.6 million, respectively, at April 3, 2004. Additionally, for each of the fiscal years in the two year period ended April 3, 2004, the reclassification of the amortization of deferred lease incentives resulted in a decrease to rent expense 32 Table of Contents and a corresponding increase to depreciation expense of $2.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively. A $5.5 million decrease was recorded to retained earnings as of March 30, 2002 as a result of this restatement. In January 2000, we formed Ralph Lauren Media, LLC as a joint venture with the National Broadcasting Company. Under this 30 year joint venture agreement, Ralph Lauren Media is owned 50% by the Company and 37.5% by NBC and 12.5% by ValueVision Media. We had used the equity method of accounting for our investment in the joint venture since its inception. On December 24, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued FIN 46R, which is applicable for financial statements issued for reporting periods ending after March 15, 2004. The Company considered the provisions of FIN 46R in its fiscal 2004 financial statements and made the determination that Ralph Lauren Media was a variable interest entity (VIE) under FIN 46R. At that time the Company also determined that it was not the primary beneficiary under FIN 46R and, therefore, was not required to consolidate the results of Ralph Lauren Media. Upon subsequent review the Company has now concluded that its determination in 2004 was incorrect and that consolidation of Ralph Lauren Media into the Companys financial statements was required as of April 3, 2004. The impact on the Companys balance sheet as of April 3, 2004 is to increase assets by approximately $18 million and liabilities by approximately $9 million and minority interest by approximately $9 million. Previously, the Company accounted for this joint venture using the equity method of accounting, under which we recognized our share of Ralph Lauren Medias operating results based on our share of ownership and the terms of the joint venture agreement. As a result, there is no impact from the consolidation on prior years reported earnings. We also corrected the classification of the net loss recorded on the disposal of property and equipment from the investing activities section to the operating activities section within the Statement of Cash Flows for Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003. Further, upon review of the Fiscal 2004 Statement of Cash Flows, we concluded that certain foreign exchange results previously classified as Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and net investment in foreign subsidiaries should be classified as operating activities and have made these corrections as part of the restatement. See Notes 2 and 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K for a summary of the effects of the restatements of previously issued financial statements to reflect the above items. The accompanying Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations gives effect to these restatements. Fiscal 2005 Overall Results During Fiscal 2005, overall revenue increased $655.8 million, or 24.7%, primarily as a result of the acquisition of the Childrenswear business, the presence of the Lauren line in our wholesale segment for a full year and strong growth in our retail segment, partially offset by sales declines in our Mens wholesale business due to a planned reduction in off price sales. Our licensing revenue decreased $24.1 million, or 9.0%, as a result of loss of licensing income from the Lauren and Childrenswear labels. Gross profit increased $361.2 million, or 27.3%, and our gross margin as a percentage of sales (gross margin rate) increased to 51.0% from 49.9% in Fiscal 2004. The increasing gross margin rate reflects the benefits of advertising, improved product mix and a continued focus on inventory management, partially offset by decreases in licensing income as a result of the acquisition of the Lauren and Childrenswear lines. Operating expenses increased $349.7 million or 33.9%, primarily as a result of litigation charges recorded in the amount of $106.2 million and the addition of expenses associated with the Childrenswear business, a full years expenses for the Lauren business and increased operating expenses associated with our growth in retail sales. During Fiscal 2005, we recorded restructuring charges of $2.3 million. These charges are primarily composed of additional severance costs for the consolidation of our European business. 33 Table of Contents Our international operating results were affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. However, the increase in net sales due to the strengthening Euro and Canadian dollar was generally offset by a comparable increase in cost of sales and operating expenses. Balance Sheet Our financial position remains strong. Our cash and cash equivalents decreased to $350.5 million and our cash and cash equivalents net of debt position decreased $15.5 million, primarily as a result of the purchase of the Childrenswear business and an increase in our debt due to the strengthening of the Euro. Cash flow from operations increased by $168.4 million primarily as a result of increased sales and gross profits. We intend to pay the approximately $110 million purchase price for the pending purchase of our footwear licensee out of our cash and cash equivalents. Recent Developments As described in Item 1 BUSINESS Recent Developments and Item 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, we have recorded a reserve of $100.0 million in connection with our litigation with Jones Apparel Group, Inc. over the termination of the Lauren product line license previously held by Jones. On March 24, 2005, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court affirmed the lower Courts orders in favor of Jones. We filed a motion with the Appellate Division for reargument and or permission to appeal its decision to the New York Court of Appeals, and on June 23, 2005, the Appellate Division denied our request for reargument but granted our motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals. If the Court of Appeals does not reverse the Appellate Divisions decision, the case will go back to the lower court for a trial on damages. Although we intend to continue to defend the case vigorously, in light of the Appellate Divisions decision we recorded a charge of $100.0 million during Fiscal 2005 to establish a reserve for this litigation. This charge represents managements best estimate at this time of the loss incurred. No discovery has been held, and the ultimate outcome of this matter could differ materially from the reserved amount. Jones is seeking compensatory damages of $550.0 million plus punitive damages relating to our alleged tortuous interference in the non compete and confidentiality provisions of Jackwyn Nemerovs former employment agreement with Jones. If Jones were to be awarded the full amount of damages it seeks, the award would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. The royalties that we received pursuant to the Lauren license agreements and Ralph license agreements represented revenues of approximately $23.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively, in Fiscal 2004 prior to the termination of these licenses on December 31, 2003 and $37.4 million and $5.3 million respectively during Fiscal 2003. In total, royalties received from Jones (consisting solely of royalties from the Polo Jeans license agreements, since the termination of the Lauren and Ralph licenses), accounted for 7.2%, 17.2% and 27.2% of our aggregate licensing revenue for Fiscal 2005, Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003, respectively. As described in more detail in Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K, we are subject to various claims relating to an alleged security breach of our retail point of sale system, including fraudulent credit card charges, the cost of replacing cards and related monitoring expenses and other related claims. We are unable to predict the extent to which further claims will be asserted. We have contested and will continue to vigorously contest the claims made against it and continues to explore its defenses and possible claims against others. We have established a reserve of $6.2 million on its balance sheet relating to this matter, representing managements best estimate at this time of the loss incurred. The ultimate outcome of this matter could differ from the amounts recorded. While that difference could be material to the results of operations for any affected reporting period, it is not expected to have a material impact on consolidated financial position or liquidity. In June 2003, one of our licensing partners, WestPoint Stevens, Inc., and certain of its affiliates (WestPoint) filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. WestPoint produces bedding and bath product in our Home Collection. On December 19, 2003, the United States Bankruptcy Court approved an amended licensing agreement between WestPoint and 34 Table of Contents us, which provides for the same royalty rate and minimum royalties that are not materially lower than under the previous agreement. On June 24, 2005, American Real Estate Properties, LP, an entity controlled by investor Carl Icahn, won the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved bidding process for WestPoints assets, subject to final confirmation at a hearing to be held August 17, 2005. The Company believes that the new owners will continue the relationship on satisfactory terms. The contract with WestPoint Stevens expires in December of 2005. Recent Acquisitions On May 23, 2005, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Reebok International, Ltd to acquire all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Ralph Lauren Footwear Co., Inc, the global licensee for mens, womens and childrens footwear, as well as certain foreign assets owned by affiliates of Reebok International Ltd (collectively, the Footwear Business). The purchase price for the acquisition of the Footwear Business will be approximately $110 million in cash payable at closing, subject to certain closing adjustments. Payment of the purchase price will be funded by cash on hand and lines of credit as required. In addition, the Footwear Licensee and certain of its affiliates have entered into a transition services agreement with us to provide a variety of operational, financial and information systems services over a period of twelve to eighteen months. The closing of the proposed transaction is subject to customary conditions, including the receipt of certain third party consents and the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The closing of the transaction is anticipated to occur in July 2005. On July 2, 2004, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of RL Childrenswear Company, LLC for a purchase price of approximately $263.5 million including transaction costs. The purchase price includes deferred payments of $15 million over the next three years, and we have agreed to assume certain liabilities. Additionally, we agreed to pay up to an additional $5 million in contingent payments if certain sales targets are attained. During the third quarter, we recorded a $5 million liability for this contingent purchase payment because we believe it is probable the sales targets will be achieved. This amount was recorded as an increase in goodwill. RL Childrenswear Company, LLC was our licensee holding the exclusive licenses to design, manufacture, merchandise and sell newborn, infant, toddler and girls and boys clothing in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded fair values for assets and liabilities as follows: inventory of $26.6 million, property and equipment of $7.5 million, intangible assets, consisting of non compete agreements, valued at $2.5 million and customer relationships, valued at $29.9 million, other assets of $1.0 million, goodwill of $208.3 million and liabilities of $12.3 million. The results of operations for the Childrenswear line for the period are included in the consolidated results of operations commencing July 2, 2004, for the year ended April 2, 2005. The following unaudited pro forma information assumes the Childrenswear acquisition had occurred on March 30, 2003. The pro forma information, as presented below, is not indicative of the results that would have been obtained had the transaction occurred March 30, 2003, nor is it indicative of the Companys future results. The unaudited pro forma information is presented based on the preliminary purchase price allocation. The final purchase price allocation and the resulting effect on net income may differ significantly from the unaudited pro forma amounts included herein (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts). The following pro forma amounts reflect adjustments for purchases made by us from Childrenswear, licensing royalties paid to us by Childrenswear, amortization of the non compete agreements, lost interest income on the cash used for the purchase and the income tax effect based upon unaudited pro forma effective tax rate of 35.5% in Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004. The unaudited pro forma information gives effect only to adjustments described above and does not reflect managements estimate of any anticipated cost savings or other benefits as a result of the acquisition. The unaudited pro forma amounts include material non recurring charges of approximately $7.4 million that are recorded within Cost of goods sold related to the write up to fair value of inventory as part of the preliminary purchase price allocation (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts). 35 Table of Contents For the Year Ended April 2, April 3, 2005 2004 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Net revenue $ 3,359,168 $ 2,858,458 Net income 195,338 186,164 Net income per share Basic $ 1.92 $ 1.88 Net income per share Diluted $ 1.88 $ 1.84 Restructurings During Fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic review of our European businesses and formalized our plans to centralize and more efficiently consolidate our business operations. The major initiatives of the plan included the following: consolidation of our headquarters from five cities in three countries to one location, the consolidation of our European logistics operations to Italy and the migration of all European information systems to a standard global system. In connection with the implementation of this plan, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $2.1 million, $7.9 million and $14.4 million during Fiscal 2005, Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003, respectively. $23.3 million had been paid through April 2, 2005 in connection with this implementation. The remaining balance which consists primarily of lease termination costs will be paid over the life of the lease. During Fiscal 2001, we implemented the 2001 Operational Plan. Due to real estate market factors that were less favorable than originally estimated, we recorded an additional $10.4 million charge during Fiscal 2004. The remaining balance which consists primarily of lease termination costs will be paid over the life of the lease. Results of Operations The table below sets forth results in millions of dollars and the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain items in our consolidated statements of income for our last three fiscal years: Fiscal Year Ended April 2, April 3, March 29, April 2, April 3, March 29, 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Net sales $ 3,060.7 $ 2,380.9 $ 2,189.3 92.6 % 89.9 % 89.8 % Licensing revenue 244.7 268.8 250.0 7.4 % 10.1 % 10.2 % Net revenues 3,305.4 2,649.7 2,439.3 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross profit 1,684.5 1,323.3 1,207.6 51.0 % 49.9 % 49.5 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,382.5 1,032.9 902.4 41.8 % 39.0 % 37.0 % Restructuring charge 2.3 19.5 14.4 0.1 % 0.7 % 0.6 % Income from operations 299.7 270.9 290.8 9.1 % 10.2 % 11.9 % Foreign currency (gains) losses (6.1 ) 1.9 0.5 (0.2 )% Interest expense 6.4 10.0 13.5 0.2 % 0.4 % 0.6 % Income before provision for income taxes and Other expense (income) 299.4 259.0 276.8 9.1 % 9.8 % 11.3 % Provision for income taxes 107.4 93.9 101.1 3.3 % 3.5 % 4.1 % Other expense (income), net 1.6 (4.1 ) 0.0 % (0.1 )% Net income $ 190.4 $ 169.2 $ 175.7 5.8 % 6.4 % 7.2 % 36 Table of Contents Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Net Revenues. Net revenues for Fiscal 2005 were $3.3 billion, an increase of $655.8 million over net revenues for Fiscal 2004. Wholesale revenues primarily increased as a result of the sale of Lauren and Childrenswear products. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales elsewhere in our wholesale business primarily driven by planned reductions in off price sales in our mens, womens and European business as well as the loss of the Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones. The increase in net revenues was also caused by increases in our retail segment as a result of our improved comparable retail store sales, continued store expansion and the favorable impact of the strengthening Euro. Net revenues for our business segments are provided below (Dollars in thousands). Fiscal Year Ended April 2, April 3, Increase 2005 2004 (Decrease) % Change Net revenues: Wholesale $ 1,712,040 $ 1,210,397 $ 501,643 41.4 % Retail 1,348,645 1,170,447 178,198 15.2 % Licensing 244,730 268,810 (24,080 ) (9.0 )% Total Net Revenue $ 3,305,415 $ 2,649,654 $ 655,761 24.7 % Wholesale net sales the increase primarily reflects: incremental increase from the Lauren line of approximately $280.5 million in the current year due to the inclusion of a full years sales versus one quarters sales in the prior year; inclusion of sales from the newly acquired Childrenswear line of $180.2 million commencing July 2, 2004; a $51.2 million decrease in the domestic mens wholesale business, which resulted from a planned reduction in off price sales and a reduction in spring sales due to a planned reduction of sales to lower margin customers; and increases in the European wholesale business of approximately $37.4 million on a constant dollar basis, as well as a $28.4 million favorable impact due to a stronger Euro in the current period. Retail net sales the increase primarily reflects: a $21.2 million, or 5.5%, increase in comparable full price store sales and a $27.5 million, or 3.9%, increase in comparable outlet store sales. Sales increased $16.3 million, or 4.2%, in comparable full price stores and a $21.8 million, or 3.1%, in comparable outlet stores on a constant dollar basis. Excluding the extra week in Fiscal 2004, comparable store sales increased 6.1% and 4.9% in full price and outlet stores, respectively, on a constant dollar basis. Comparable store sales information includes both Ralph Lauren stores and Club Monaco stores. the inclusion of $60.6 million of sales as a result of consolidation of RL Media. worldwide store expansion. During Fiscal 2005, the Company added 30 stores and closed 13 stores. Our total store count at April 2, 2005 was 278 stores compared to 261 stores at April 3, 2004. the stronger Euro during the current year, which accounted for approximately $14.7 million of the increase in net sales. Licensing revenue the decrease primarily reflects: the elimination of $34.6 million of royalties from our domestic licensing business due to the acquisition of the Childrenswear business and a full year without royalties from the Lauren licensee. a $13.1 million increase in international licensing. 37 Table of Contents Gross Profit. Gross profit increased $361.2 million, or 27.3%, for Fiscal 2005 compared to Fiscal 2004. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 51.0% from 49.9% primarily as a result of improved margins in our wholesale and retail businesses driven by reduced markdowns and our inventory management initiatives. Partially offsetting these improvements is the loss of licensing revenues from the Lauren and Childrenswear lines. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A increased $349.7 million, or 33.9%, to $1.383 billion during Fiscal 2005 from $1.033 billion in Fiscal 2004. SG&A as a percent of net revenues increased to 41.8% from 39.0%. The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by: the charge of $100.0 million recorded in connection with the Jones litigation and the charge of $6.2 million recorded in connection with the credit card matter. higher selling salaries and related costs of $84.8 million, on a constant dollar basis, in connection with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion. approximately $19.8 million of the increase in SG&A was due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the Euro Fiscal 2005. expenses of $29.6 million as a result of the consolidation of Ralph Lauren Media. incremental expenses of $22.3 million associated with a full years activity in the Lauren wholesale business, exclusive of additional corporate and overhead expenses incurred and reduced royalty revenues received. expenses of $37.8 million associated with the newly acquired Childrenswear business. Restructuring Charge. We recorded restructuring charges of $2.3 million during Fiscal 2005, compared to restructuring charges of $19.6 million during Fiscal 2004. The Fiscal 2005 restructuring charge is primarily comprised of additional contract termination and severance costs related to the consolidation of our European business operations. Income (Loss) from Operations. Income from operations increased $28.8 million, or 10.6%, in Fiscal 2005 compared to Fiscal 2004. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in wholesale and retail operating profits that was partially offset by an increase in SG&A costs driven by the items noted above. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the licensing segments profits due to the loss of the Lauren and Childrenswear royalties. Income from operations was not significantly impacted by the stronger Euro and Canadian dollar, because the increased sales resulting from exchange rate fluctuations were substantially offset by a comparable increase in expenses. Income from operations for our business segments are provided below (Dollars in thousands). Fiscal Year Ended April 2, April 3, Increase 2005 2004 (Decrease) % Change Income (Loss) from operations Wholesale $ 299,710 $ 143,080 $ 156,630 109.5 % Retail 82,788 55,717 27,071 48.6 % Licensing 159,537 191,575 (32,038 ) (16.7 )% 542,035 390,372 $ 151,663 38.9 % Less: Unallocated Corporate expense (133,809 ) (99,915 ) (33,894 ) (33.9 %) Unallocated legal and restructuring charges (108,541 ) (19,566 ) Income from operations $ 299,685 $ 270,891 Wholesale operating income increased primarily as a result of incremental net sales in our newly acquired Childrenswear business and a full year of activity in the Lauren business. 38 Table of Contents Retail operating income increased primarily as a result of increased net sales and improved gross profits as a percentage of net revenues. These increases were partially offset by the increase in selling salaries and related costs in connection with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion. Licensing income decreased primarily due to the loss of the Lauren and Childrens royalties. This decrease was partially offset by improvements in our international licensing business. Unallocated Corporate Expenses increased primarily as a result of increased stock compensation expense and increased bonus accrual resulting from our increased operating income. Foreign Currency (Gains) Losses. The effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a gain of $6.1 million during Fiscal 2005, compared to a $1.9 million loss during Fiscal 2004. These gains are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are converted to U.S. dollars. Interest Expense, Net. Interest expense decreased to $6.4 million in Fiscal 2005 from $10.0 million for Fiscal 2004. This decrease was due to the repayment of approximately $100.0 million of short term borrowings during Fiscal 2004, as well as decreased interest rates as a result of the interest rate swaps described in Liquidity and Capital Resources Derivative Instruments. Provision for Income Taxes. The effective tax rate was 35.9% for Fiscal 2005, compared to 36.2% for Fiscal 2004. Other Expense (Income), Net. Other expense (income) net was $1.6 million for Fiscal 2005. This reflects $6.4 million of income related to our 20% equity interest in Impact21, the company that holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan, net of $3.8 million of minority interest expense associated with our Japanese master license, both of which were acquired in February 2003 (excluding the additional 2% equity interest in the entity that holds the sublicenses that we acquired in May 2003). Also included in Fiscal 2005 is $4.2 million of minority interest expense for Ralph Lauren Media. Net Income. Net income increased for Fiscal 2005 to $190.4 million from $169.2 million for Fiscal 2004, or 5.8% and 6.4% of net revenues, respectively. Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis increased by $0.15 to $1.83 per share as a result of the increase in net income for the reasons previously discussed partially offset by an increase in diluted shares outstanding of 3.1 million due to the exercise of stock options, a higher average stock price and the award of restricted stock units to executives. Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 Net Revenues. Net revenues for Fiscal 2004 were $2.650 billion, an increase of $210.3 million over net revenues for Fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to increases in our retail segment as a result of our improved comparable retail store sales, continued store expansion and the favorable impact of the strengthening Euro and Canadian dollar. Also contributing to the sales increase was the 53rd week in Fiscal 2004 compared to 52 weeks in Fiscal 2003. The 53rd week was responsible for an estimated $39.5 million of the sales increase. Further influencing the increase in net revenues were overall increases in licensing revenues driven by the incremental effect of the consolidation of revenues from the Japanese master license and improved results in the footwear business. Additionally, wholesale revenues increased as a result of the sale of Lauren products commencing in the third quarter of fiscal year 2004. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales in our wholesale business primarily driven by planned reductions in off price sales in our 39 Table of Contents mens, womens and European business as well as the loss of the Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones. Net revenues for our business segments are provided below (dollars in thousands). Fiscal Year Ended April 3, March 29, Increase 2004 2003 (Decrease) % Change Net revenues: Wholesale $ 1,210,397 $ 1,187,363 $ 23,034 1.9 % Retail 1,170,447 1,001,958 168,489 16.8 % Licensing 268,810 250,019 18,791 7.5 % Total Net Revenue $ 2,649,654 $ 2,439,340 $ 210,314 8.6 % Wholesale net sales increased primarily due to: the addition of the Lauren line, which accounted for net sales of approximately $109.8 million in the current year, partially offset by: a $60.4 million decrease in the domestic mens wholesale business, which resulted from a planned reduction in off price sales and a reduction in spring sales due to a planned reduction of sales to lower margin customers. the elimination of the womens Ralph Lauren Sport line, which accounted for net sales of approximately $12.3 million in the prior year. decreases in the European wholesale business, primarily due to the soft economic conditions in Europe, of approximately $65.4 million on a constant dollar basis, offset by a $45.1 million favorable impact due to a stronger Euro in the current period. Retail net sales increased primarily as a result of: a $43.7 million, or 14.4%, increase in comparable full price store sales and a $48.8 million, or 7.6%, increase in comparable outlet store sales on a constant dollar basis. Excluding the extra week in Fiscal 2004, comparable store sales increased 12.2% and 5.7% in full price and outlet stores, respectively, on a constant dollar basis. Comparable store sales for the 53 weeks increased 18.0% and 8.8% for the full price stores and the outlet stores, respectively, while comparable store sales on a 52 week basis increased 15.8% for full price stores and 6.9% for outlet stores. Comparable store sales information includes both Ralph Lauren stores and Club Monaco stores. worldwide store expansion. During Fiscal 2004, the Company added 15 stores and closed 7 stores. Our total store count at April 3, 2004 was 261 stores compared to 253 stores at March 29, 2003. the stronger Euro and Canadian dollar in the current period, accounted for approximately $27.0 million of the increase in net sales. Licensing revenue the increase primarily reflects: a $27.5 million increase in international licensing primarily due to the incremental effect of the consolidation of revenues from the Japanese master license. $3.5 million increase in domestic licensing due to improvements in the footwear business. the loss of $15.8 million of Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones compared to the prior year. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased $115.7 million, or 9.6%, for Fiscal 2004 compared to Fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of the increases discussed above. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 49.9% from 49.5%. This increase reflects a change in business mix, with retail sales representing 44.2% of revenues in Fiscal 2004 compared to 41.1% in Fiscal 2003 and improved margins in our Ralph Lauren and Club Monaco retail stores. The increasing gross profit rate also reflects higher realized sales dollars resulting from a combination of improved product mix as well as the benefits of advertising and targeted marketing. The 40 Table of Contents rate improvement also reflects a continued focus on inventory management. Although our inventory balance at April 2, 2005 is approximately the same as it was at April 3, 2004, this primarily reflects the appreciation of the Euro, inventories related to our Lauren wholesale business and increased levels of inventory related to our retail growth offset by decreases in inventory in other lines of business. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A increased $130.6 million, or 14.5%, to $1.033 billion during Fiscal 2004 from $902.3 million during Fiscal 2003. SG&A as a percent of net revenues increased to 39.0% from 37.0%. The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by: Higher selling salaries and related costs of $48.7 million, exclusive of the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in connection with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion. Approximately $30.4 million of the increase in SG&A was due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the Euro and Canadian dollar in Fiscal 2004. Expenses of $28.1 million associated with the Lauren wholesale business, exclusive of additional corporate and overhead expenses incurred and reduced royalty revenues received. $19.0 million of increased international licensing SG&A primarily due to the consolidation of incremental expenses relating to the Japanese master license. Restructuring Charge. We recorded restructuring charges of $19.6 million during Fiscal 2004, compared to restructuring charges of $14.4 million during Fiscal 2003. The Fiscal 2004 restructuring charge is comprised of an additional $10.4 million for lease termination costs primarily associated with two Club Monaco retail properties included in our 2001 Operational Plan due to real estate market factors that were less favorable than originally estimated, $7.9 million for additional contract termination and severance costs related to the consolidation of our European business operations (approximately $6.7 million for the wholesale business and $1.2 million for the retail business) and $1.3 million for lease termination and asset write offs associated with the March 2004 decision to close our RRL stores. The Fiscal 2003 restructuring charge of $14.4 million related to severance and contract termination costs in connection with the consolidation of our European business operations. Income (Loss) from Operations. Income from operations decreased $20.0 million, or 6.9%, in Fiscal 2004 compared to Fiscal 2003. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in wholesale operating profits, restructuring charges, the decrease in Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones following the license termination in December 2003 and the start up expenses associated with the Lauren line. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the retail segments profits. Income from operations was not significantly impacted by the stronger Euro and Canadian dollar in Fiscal 2004 because the increased sales resulting from exchange rate fluctuations were substantially offset by a comparable increase in expenses. Income from operations for our business segments are provided below (Dollars in thousands). Fiscal Year Ended April 3, March 29, Increase 2004 2003 (Decrease) % Change Income (Loss) from operations Wholesale $ 143,080 $ 166,016 $ (22,936 ) (13.8 )% Retail 55,717 30,707 25,010 81.4 % Licensing 191,575 200,189 (8,614 ) (4.3 )% 390,372 396,912 $ (6,540 ) (1.6 )% Less: Unallocated Corporate expense (99,915 ) (91,614 ) (8,301 ) (9.1 )% Unallocated restructuring charge (19,566 ) (14,443 ) Income from operations $ 270,891 $ 290,855 41 Table of Contents Wholesale operating income decreased primarily as a result of decreased net sales in our domestic mens business and European wholesale operations. The incremental effect of Lauren sales in the fourth quarter on our wholesale business income from operations was largely offset by start up and ordinary operating expenses associated with the Lauren wholesale business. Retail operating income increased primarily as a result of increased net sales and improved gross profits as a percentage of net revenues. These increases were partially offset by the increase in selling salaries and related costs in connection with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion. Licensing income decreased primarily due to the loss of the Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones. This decrease was partially offset by improvements in the footwear business and by the inclusion of the operations of the Japanese Master License. Foreign Currency (Gains) Losses. The effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss of $1.9 million during Fiscal 2004, compared to a $0.5 million loss during Fiscal 2003. These losses primarily related to transaction losses on unhedged inventory purchases and royalty payments in Europe resulting from increases in the value of the Euro compared to the dollar. These losses are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are converted to U.S. dollars. In the prior period, these losses primarily related to transaction losses on the unhedged portion of our Euro denominated debt caused by appreciation of the Euro until we entered into the cross currency swap in June 2002, which were partially offset by $1.3 million of gains recorded on the Japanese forward contracts that we entered into in November of 2002. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $10.0 million in Fiscal 2004 from $13.5 million for Fiscal 2003. This decrease was due to the repayment of approximately $100.0 million of short term borrowings during Fiscal 2004, as well as decreased interest rates as a result of the May 2003 interest rate swap described in Liquidity and Capital Resources Commitments Derivative Instruments. Provision for Income Taxes. The effective tax rate was 36.2% for Fiscal 2004 compared to 36.5% for Fiscal 2003. Other (Income) Expense, Net. Other (income) expense, net was $(4.1) million for Fiscal 2004. This reflects $5.5 million of income related to the 20% equity interest in the company that holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan, net of $1.4 million of minority interest expense associated with our Japanese master license, both of which were acquired in February 2003 (except for the additional 2% equity interest in the entity that holds the sublicenses that we acquired in May 2003). Net Income. Net income decreased for Fiscal 2004 to $169.2 million from $175.7 million for Fiscal 2003, or 6.4% and 7.2% of net revenues, respectively. Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis decreased by $0.09 to $1.68 per share as a result of the decrease in net income for the reasons previously discussed and an increase in diluted shares outstanding of 1.7 million due to the exercise of stock options, a higher average stock price and the award of restricted stock units to executives. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund growth in working capital (primarily accounts receivable and inventory) to support projected sales increases, acquisitions, construction and renovation of shop within shops, investment in the technological upgrading of our distribution centers and information systems, expenditures related to retail store expansion, acquisitions, dividends, and other corporate activities. Sources of liquidity to fund ongoing and future cash requirements include cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, credit facilities and other borrowings. We anticipate funding the approximately $110 million purchase price of the pending Footwear Business through the use of our cash and cash equivalents. 42 Table of Contents Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 We ended Fiscal 2005 with $350.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $291.0 million of debt outstanding compared to $352.3 million and $277.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and debt outstanding, respectively, at April 3, 2004. This represents a $15.5 million decrease in our cash net of debt position over the last twelve months which is primarily attributable to the following factors: the use of $241.9 million of cash to purchase the Childrenswear business and an increase in Euro debt of $13.6 million as a result of the strengthening of the Euro, partially offset by increased cash flow from operations and increased proceeds received from the exercise of stock options. Additionally, capital expenditures were $174.1 million for Fiscal 2005 compared to $126.3 million in Fiscal 2004. As of April 2, 2005, we had $291.0 million outstanding in long term Euro debt based on the year end Euro exchange rate, an increase of $13.6 million from Fiscal 2004. The increase was entirely due to changes in the Euro to Dollar exchange rate. We were also contingently liable for $29.8 million in outstanding letters of credit primarily related to commitments for the purchase of inventory. The weighted average interest rate on our borrowings at April 2, 2005 was 3.4%. Accounts receivable increased $14.0 million primarily as a result of the inclusion in Fiscal 2005 $30.4 million in Childrenswear accounts receivable and a $7.4 million impact of the strengthening Euro, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable in our Lauren and mens divisions resulting from the timing of payments. Inventories increased $56.9 million in Fiscal 2005. The inception of the Childrenswear line was responsible for a $23.4 million increase, our mens business had an increase in inventory of $17.8 million, primarily as a result of increased summer bookings. The strengthening of the Euro caused a $6.7 million increase in inventory. Accounts payable decreased $4.5 million compared to Fiscal 2004 primarily as result of a $12.7 million decrease in our Lauren business, partially offset by increases in other areas. Accrued expenses increased $129.1 million from Fiscal 2004, primarily as a result of the accrual of $100.0 million for a reserve relating to the Jones litigation as well as the addition of the Childrenswear label and increases in Europe due to the timing of year end invoice receipts. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $382.0 million during Fiscal 2005 compared to $213.6 million in Fiscal 2004. This $168.4 million increase in cash flow was driven primarily by the year over year increases in sales and gross profit. During Fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic review of our European business and formalized our plans to centralize and more efficiently consolidate our business operations. In connection with the implementation of this plan, we had total cash outlays of approximately $6.2 million during the year ended April 2, 2005. We also had cash outlays of $2.4 million during Fiscal 2005 in connection with our 2001 restructuring plan, primarily related to lease termination costs. It is expected that the remaining liabilities of both plans will be paid accordance with contract terms. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $417.4 million in Fiscal 2005, as compared to $134.5 million in Fiscal 2004. Both the Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004 net cash used primarily reflected capital expenditures related to retail expansion and upgrading our systems and facilities, as well as shop within shop expenditures. The Fiscal 2005 net cash used also reflects $241.9 million for the purchase of our Childrenswear business. Our anticipated capital expenditures for Fiscal 2006 approximate $175 million. Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $31.5 million in Fiscal 2005 compared to $76.4 million used in Fiscal 2004. Cash provided by financing activities during Fiscal 2005, consisted of the payment of $21.7 million in dividends, offset by proceeds of $54.3 million from the exercise of stock options. Cash used during Fiscal 2004 primarily consisted of net repayment of short term borrowings of $100.9 million and the payment of $14.8 million in dividends, partially offset by the $40.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 43 Table of Contents Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 We ended Fiscal 2004 with $352.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $277.3 million of debt outstanding compared to $343.6 million and $349.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and debt outstanding, respectively, at March 29, 2003. This represents a $80.8 million increase in our cash net of debt position over the last twelve months which is primarily attributable to the following factors: (i) reduced spending on acquisitions and investments, (ii) increased proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, (iii) partially offset by reduced cash flows from operations and an increase in Euro debt of $28.9 million as a result of the strengthening of the Euro. Additionally, capital expenditures were $126.3 million for Fiscal 2004 compared to $102.4 million in Fiscal 2003. As of April 3, 2004, we had $277.3 million outstanding in long term Euro debt based on the year end Euro exchange rate, an increase of $28.9 million from Fiscal 2003. The increase was entirely due to changes in the Euro to Dollar exchange rate. We were also contingently liable for $35.3 million in outstanding letters of credit primarily related to commitments for the purchase of inventory. The weighted average interest rate on our borrowings at April 2, 2005 was 3.8%. Accounts receivable increased $65.9 million primarily as a result of the inception of sales under the Lauren label and the strengthening of the Euro. $86.5 million of the increase was due to Lauren and $13.2 million was due to the change in the value of the Euro. These increases were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable in our other wholesale divisions resulting from sales decreases and the timing of payments. Inventories decreased $9.4 million in Fiscal 2004. The inception of the Lauren line was responsible for a $34.1 million increase and the strengthening of the Euro caused a $14.3 million increase in inventory. These increases were more than offset by reductions in inventory in our retail and Mens wholesale business as a result of improvements in our supply chain forecasting and management and reduced inventory requirements in our mens business as a result of planned reductions in sales. Other current assets increased $34.7 million from Fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of increases in European Value Added Tax receivables and the effect of the timing of the fiscal year end on prepaid items. Accounts payable increased $7.5 million compared to Fiscal 2003 primarily as result of the addition of the Lauren line partially offset by reductions in our mens line due to a decrease in inventory purchases and reductions in Europe due to the timing of year end invoice receipts. Accrued expenses increased $80.6 million primarily as a result of the addition of the Lauren line, increases in the European Value Added Tax payable, and increases in Europe due to the timing of year end invoice receipts. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $213.6 million during Fiscal 2004, compared to $286.2 million in Fiscal 2003. This $72.6 million decrease in cash flow was driven primarily by the year over year changes in working capital described above and the decrease in net income of $6.5 million. During Fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic review of our European business and formalized our plans to centralize and more efficiently consolidate its business operations. In connection with the implementation of this plan, we had total cash outlays of approximately $13.3 million during the year ended April 3, 2004. We also had cash outlays of $8.3 million during Fiscal 2004 in connection with our 2001 restructuring plan, primarily related to lease termination costs. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $134.5 million in Fiscal 2004, as compared to $183.5 million in Fiscal 2003. Both the Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003 net cash used primarily reflected capital expenditures related to retail expansion and upgrading our systems and facilities, as well as shop within shop expenditures. The Fiscal 2004 net cash used also reflects $5.4 million for an additional 2% equity interest in Impact21, the company that holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan, and an additional $3.5 million primarily for additional transaction costs to acquire a 50% interest in the Japanese master license, offset by $8.9 million of cash resulting from the 44 Table of Contents consolidation of RL Media, $1.0 million for an additional payment on the first earn out payment calculation in connection with the PRL Fashions of Europe SRL acquisition and $7.5 million for the acquisition in November 2003 of a license for the use of trademarks. Fiscal 2003 net cash used, reflects $78 million primarily for the acquisition of a 50% interest in the Japanese Master license and an 18% equity interest in Impact21, the company holding the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens, and jeans business in Japan. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $76.4 million in Fiscal 2004 compared to $16.7 million in Fiscal 2003. Cash used in financing activities during Fiscal 2004, consisted of the net repayment of short term borrowings of $100.9 million and the payment of $14.8 million in dividends, partially offset by proceeds of $40.4 million from the exercise of stock options. Cash used during Fiscal 2003 primarily consisted of net repayments of borrowings of $19.7 million and repurchases of common stock totaling $4.7 million, partially offset by $7.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Credit Facilities and Other In March 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, subject to market conditions, of up to $100.0 million of our Class A common stock. Share repurchases were to be made in the open market over a two year period. The Board of Directors has extended the stock repurchase program through April 1, 2006. Shares acquired under the repurchase program are used for stock option programs and for other corporate purposes. As of April 2, 2005, we had repurchased 4.1 million shares of our Class A common stock at an aggregate cost of $77.5 million. On February 1, 2005, our Board of Directors approved an additional stock repurchase plan which allows for the repurchase of up to an additional $100 million in our stock. No repurchases have been made under this plan, which does not have a termination date. In November 1999, we issued Euro 275.0 million of 6.125% notes due November 2006. Our Euro debt is listed on the London Stock Exchange. The net proceeds from the Euro offering were $281.5 million, based on the Euro exchange rate on the issuance date. Interest on the Euro debt is payable annually. A portion of these net proceeds was used to acquire Poloco S.A.S. (our principal European subsidiary), and the remaining net proceeds were retained for general corporate purposes. Through Fiscal 2005, we had repurchased Euro 47.7 million, or $43.6 million, based on Euro exchange rates at the time of repurchase of our outstanding Euro debt. Prior to October 6, 2004, we had a credit facility with a syndicate of banks consisting of a $300.0 million revolving line of credit, subject to increase to $375.0 million, which was available for direct borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit. It was scheduled to mature on November 18, 2005. On October 6, 2004, we, in substance, expanded and extended this bank credit facility by entering into a new credit agreement, dated as of that date, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent, The Bank of New York, Fleet National Bank, SunTrust Bank and Wachovia Bank National Association, as Syndication Agents, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as sole Bookrunner and Sole Lead Arranger, and a syndicate of lending banks that included each of the lending banks under the prior credit agreement (the New Credit Facility). The New Credit Facility, which is otherwise substantially on the same terms as the prior credit facility, provides for a $450.0 million revolving line of credit, subject to increase to $525.0 million, which is available for direct borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit. It will mature on October 6, 2009. As of April 2, 2005, we had no direct borrowings outstanding under the New Credit Facility but were contingently liable for $29.8 million in outstanding letters of credit related primarily to commitments for the purchase of inventory. We incur a financing charge of ten basis points per month on the average monthly balance of these outstanding letters of credit. Direct borrowings under the New Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to (i) the higher of (x) the weighted average overnight Federal funds rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus one half of one percent, and (y) the prime commercial lending rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank in effect from time to time, or (ii) the LIBO Rate (as defined in the New Credit Facility) in effect from time to time, as adjusted for the Federal Reserve Boards Eurocurrency Liabilities maximum reserve percentage, and a margin based on our then current credit ratings. 45 Table of Contents The New Credit Facility requires us to maintain certain financial covenants, including: a minimum ratio of consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization and Rent (EBITDAR) to Consolidated Interest Expense (as such terms are described in the New Credit Facility); and a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt (as defined in the New Credit Facility) to EBITDAR. The New Credit Facility also contains covenants that, subject to specified exceptions, restrict our ability to: incur additional debt; incur liens and contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets, including equity interests; merge with or acquire other companies, liquidate or dissolve; engage in businesses that are not a related line of business; make loans, advances or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make investments. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the New Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the New Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The New Credit Facility specifies a number of events of default (many of which are subject to applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure to make timely principal and interest payments or to satisfy the covenants, including the financial covenants described above. Additionally, the New Credit Facility provides that an event of default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren and related entities fail to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power of our common stock. As of April 2, 2005, the Company was in compliance with all financial and non financial debt covenants. In Fiscal 2003, the Board of Directors initiated a dividend program consisting of quarterly cash dividends of $0.05 per outstanding share, or $0.20 per outstanding share on an annual basis, on our common stock. Dividends of $0.05 per outstanding share declared to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 2, 2004, October 1, 2004, December 20, 2004 and April 1, 2005 were paid on July 16, 2004, October 15, 2004, January 14, 2005 and April 15, 2005, respectively. We expect that cash flow from operations will continue to be sufficient to fund our current level of operations, capital requirements, cash dividends and our stock repurchase plan. However, in the event of a material acquisition, material contingencies or material adverse business developments, we may need to draw on our credit facility or other potential sources of borrowing. As previously discussed, our ability to borrow under our credit facility is subject to our maintenance of financial and other covenants. As of April 2, 2005, we had no direct borrowings under the credit facility and were in compliance with our covenants. With respect to pending or threatened litigation, the only matter which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources is the litigation with Jones Apparel Group, Inc., in which Jones is seeking, among other things, compensatory damages of $550 million and unspecified punitive damages. See Item 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. As noted above, we recorded a reserve of $100 million in connection with this matter during Fiscal 2005. We continue to believe that this matter is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or capital resources or our ability to borrow under the credit facility. 46 Table of Contents Commitments The following table summarizes the Companys contractual cash obligations by period as of April 2, 2005: Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Thereafter Total (Dollars in thousands) Inventory purchase commitments $ 466,964 $ $ $ $ 466,964 Long term Euro debt 17,821 308,781 326,602 Capitalized leases 1,046 1,314 2,360 Operating leases 121,992 235,803 200,945 580,696 1,139,436 Additional acquisition purchase price payments 15,000 15,000 Other 2,150 3,700 1,250 7,100 Total $ 624,973 $ 549,598 $ 202,195 $ 580,696 $ 1,957,462 The long term Euro debt cash obligation disclosed above includes the principal amount and the interest payable at the 6.125% fixed rate. We have entered into interest rate swaps, which effectively convert the interest rate on an aggregate of Euro 205.2 million of the debt to a weighted average floating rate equal to EURIBOR plus 0.738%. The remaining Euro 22.1 million of fixed rate debt (or such lesser amount should any of the debt be repurchased) incurs interest of Euro 1.3 million per annum until the repayment date of the loan. Derivative Instruments. In June 2002, we entered into a cross currency rate swap which was scheduled to terminate in November 2006. The cross currency rate swap converted 105.2 million, 6.125% fixed rate borrowings into $100.0 million, LIBOR plus 1.24% variable rate borrowings. We entered into the cross currency rate swap to minimize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on both principal and interest payments on our long term Euro debt, and to minimize the impact of changes in the fair value of the Euro debt due to changes in LIBOR, the benchmark interest rate. The swap was designated as a fair value hedge under SFAS No. 133. Hedge ineffectiveness was measured as the difference between the respective gains or losses recognized in earnings from the changes in the fair value of the cross currency rate swap and the Euro debt. In May 2003, we terminated the cross currency rate swap and entered into an interest rate swap that will terminate in November 2006. The interest rate swap is being used to convert 105.2 million, 6.125% fixed rate borrowings into 105.2 million, EURIBOR minus 1.55% variable rate borrowings. We entered into the interest rate swap to minimize the impact of changes in the fair value of the Euro debt due to changes in EURIBOR, the benchmark interest rate. The swap had been designated as a fair value hedge under SFAS No. 133. Hedge ineffectiveness is measured as the difference between the respective gains or losses recognized in earnings from the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and the Euro debt resulting from changes in the benchmark interest rate, and was de minimis for Fiscal 2005. In addition, we have designated the entire principal of the Euro debt as a hedge of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary. As a result, changes in the fair value of the Euro debt resulting from changes in the Euro rate are reported net of income taxes in Accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements as an unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency hedges. On April 6, 2004 and October 4, 2004, we executed additional interest rate swaps to convert the fixed interest rate on an additional Euro 100 million of the Eurobonds to a floating rate (EURIBOR based). After the execution of these swaps, approximately Euro 22 million of the Eurobonds remained at a fixed interest rate. We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts as hedges relating to identifiable currency positions to reduce our risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inventory and intercompany royalty payments. Gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized as adjustments to either the basis of those assets or foreign exchange gains/losses, as applicable. At April 2, 2005, we had the following foreign exchange contracts outstanding: (i) to deliver Euro 94.3 million in exchange for $124.3 million through Fiscal 2005 and (ii) to deliver 11,389 million Japanese Yen in exchange for $99.6 million through Fiscal 2008. At April 2, 2005, the 47 Table of Contents fair value of these contracts resulted in unrealized gain and loss, net of taxes of $1.8 million and $8.2 million, for the Euro forward contracts and Japanese Yen forward contracts, respectively. To the extent that any derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, they are recorded at fair value, with all gains or losses recognized immediately in the current period earnings. In November 2002, we entered into forward contracts on 6.2 billion Japanese Yen that terminated in February 2003. While these transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, we entered into these forward contracts to minimize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the Japanese Yen denominated purchase price described in the agreements related to the purchase of a 50% interest in the Japanese master license and an 18% equity interest in the company which holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan, which were consummated during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003. We recognized $2.4 million of foreign currency gains on this transaction, which are recorded in foreign currency (gains) losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We recognize gains or losses in connection with our foreign currency contracts when the cash flows they hedge take place. We recognized $10.9 million in forward losses in Fiscal 2005, and $1.9 million in Fiscal 2004 in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These charges are recorded as components of cost of sales and royalty expense in the Consolidated statement of income. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. We do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or unconsolidated special purpose entities. Seasonality of Business Our business is affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments to retail customers and key vacation travel and holiday shopping periods in the retail segment. As a result of the growth in our retail operations and other changes in our business, historical quarterly operating trends and working capital requirements may not be indicative of future performances. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting policies employed by the Company, including the use of estimates, are presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and the results of operations, and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgements as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Companys most critical accounting policies, discussed below, pertain to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill, other long lived intangible assets, income taxes, accrued expenses and derivative instruments. In applying such policies, management must use some amounts that are based upon its informed judgements and best estimates. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgements and available information. The estimates that we make are based upon historical factors, current circumstances and the experience and judgement of our management. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations. Changes in such estimates, based on more accurate future information, may affect amounts reported in future periods. We are not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances which would result in different amounts being reported that would materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. 48 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Revenue within our wholesale operations is recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to customers. Wholesale revenue is recorded net of returns, discounts, allowances and operational chargebacks. Returns and allowances require pre approval from management. Discounts are based on trade terms. Estimates for end of season allowances are based on historic trends, seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic conditions and retailer performance. We review and refine these estimates on a quarterly basis based on current experience, trends and retailer performance. Our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. Retail store revenue is recognized net of estimated returns at the time of sale to consumers. Licensing revenue is initially recorded based upon contractually guaranteed minimum levels and adjusted as actual sales data is received from licensees. During the year ending April 2, 2005 and April 3, 2004, we reduced revenues and credited customer accounts for end of season customer allowances, operational chargebacks and returns as follows: Year Ended April 2, April 3, 2005 2004 Beginning reserve balance $ 90,269 $ 48,432 Amount expensed 265,340 213,645 Amount credited against customer accounts (256,730 ) (171,808 ) Foreign currency translation 1,122 Ending reserve balance $ 100,001 $ 90,269 Our provisions and write offs against the reserves offsetting accounts receivable increased in fiscal 2005 due to the large increase in wholesale sales and the promotional retail environment. Ending reserve balances have increased for substantially the same reasons. We require that a store be open a full fiscal year before we include it in the computation of same store sales change. Stores that are closed during the fiscal year are excluded. Stores that are relocated or enlarged are also excluded until they have been in their new location for a full fiscal year. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as measured by statutory tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the periods when the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be settled or realized. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provisions for income taxes. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. It is our policy to establish provisions for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities. We established the provisions based upon managements assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences and tax credits. The tax provisions are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustments to those provisions. Accounts Receivable, Net In the normal course of business, we extend credit to our wholesale customers that satisfy pre defined credit criteria. Accounts receivable, net, as shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is net of the following allowances and reserves. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the consolidated financial statements, assessments of collectibility based on an evaluation of historic and anticipated trends, the financial condition of the Companys customers, and an evaluation of the 49 Table of Contents impact of economic conditions. Expenses of $6.0 million were recorded as an allowance for uncollectible accounts during fiscal 2005. The amounts written off against customer accounts during fiscal 2005 totaled $2.1 million, and the balance in this reserve was $11.0 million as of April 2, 2005. A reserve for trade discounts is established based on open invoices where trade discounts have been extended to customers and is treated as a reduction of sales. Estimated customer end of season allowances (also referred to as customer markdowns) are included as a reduction of sales. These provisions are based on retail sales performance, seasonal negotiations with our customers as well as historic deduction trends and an evaluation of current market conditions. Our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. (See Revenue Recognition above) A reserve for operational chargebacks represents various deductions by customers relating to individual shipments. This reserve, net of expected recoveries, is included as a reduction of sales. The reserve is based on chargebacks received as of the date of the financial statements and past experience. Our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. (See Revenue Recognition above) Costs associated with potential returns of products are included as a reduction of sales. These reserves are based on current information regarding retail performance, historical experience and an evaluation of current market conditions. Our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. (See Revenue Recognition above) Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost First in, First out, (FIFO), method, or market. We continually evaluate the composition of our inventories assessing slow turning, ongoing product as well as prior seasons fashion product. Market value of distressed inventory is determined based on historical sales trends for the category of inventory involved, the impact of market trends and economic conditions. Estimates may differ from actual results due to quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions. We review our inventory position on a quarterly basis at a minimum and adjust our estimates based on revised projections and current market conditions. If economic conditions worsen, we incorrectly anticipate trends or unexpected events occur, our estimates could be proven overly optimistic, and required adjustments could materially adversely affect future results of operations. Our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. Goodwill, Other Intangibles, Net and Long Lived Assets SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized, but rather be tested, at least annually, for impairment. This pronouncement also requires that intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their respective lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. During fiscal 2005, there have been no material impairment losses recorded in connection with the assessment of the carrying value of long lived and intangible assets. The recoverability of the carrying values of all long lived assets with definite lives is reevaluated when changes in circumstances indicate the assets value may be impaired. In evaluating an asset for recoverability, we use our best estimate of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss, equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset, is recognized. In determining the future cash flows, we take various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the impact of more experienced store managers, the impact of increased local advertising and the emphasis on store cost controls. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, there may be future impairments in the event the future cash flows do not meet expectations. During the year ended April 2, 2005, we recorded a $1.3 million impairment charge related to the fixed assets at three Club Monaco retail locations. 50 Table of Contents Accrued Expenses Accrued expenses for employee insurance, workers compensation, profit sharing, contracted advertising, professional fees and other outstanding obligations are assessed based on claims experience and statistical trends, open contractual obligations, and estimates based on projections and current requirements. If these trends change significantly, then actual results would likely be impacted. Our historical estimates of these costs and our provisions have not differed materially from actual results. Derivative Instruments SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted, requires that each derivative instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability and measured at its fair value. The statement also requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings in either income (loss) from continuing operations or Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), depending on whether the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. We use foreign currency forward contracts for the specific purpose of hedging the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows associated primarily with inventory purchases mainly for our European businesses, royalty payments from our Japanese licensee, and other specific activities. These instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and, in accordance with SFAS No. 133, to the extent the hedges are highly effective, the changes in fair value are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of related tax effects, with the corresponding asset or liability recorded in the balance sheet. The ineffective portion of the cash flow hedge, if any, is recognized in current period earnings. Amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income are reflected in current period earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If the relative values of the currencies involved in the hedging activities were to move dramatically, such movement could have a significant impact on our results of operations. We are not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances which would result in different amounts being reported that would materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. Hedge accounting requires that at inception and at the beginning of each hedge period, we justify an expectation that the hedge will be highly effective. This effectiveness assessment involves an estimation of the probability of the occurrence of transactions for cash flow hedges. The use of different assumptions and changing market conditions may impact the results of the effectiveness assessment and ultimately the timing of when changes in derivative fair values and underlying hedged items are recorded in earnings. We hedge our net investment position in subsidiaries which conduct business in Euros by borrowing directly in foreign currency and designating a portion of our Euro denominated debt as a hedge of net investments. Under SFAS No. 133, changes in the fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in foreign currency translation, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. Inflation The rate of inflation over the past few years has not had a significant impact on our sales or profitability. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to Our Consolidated Financial Statements. Alternative Accounting Methods In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. Our significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options and inventories. Two alternative methods for accounting for stock options are available, the intrinsic value method and the fair value method. We use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options, and 51 Table of Contents accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized. Beginning in Fiscal 2007, we will be required to expense the fair value of stock options granted to employees (see discussion below). Under the fair value method, the determination of the pro forma amounts involves several assumptions including option life and future volatility. If the fair value method were used, diluted earnings per share for Fiscal 2004 would decrease approximately 10%. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Two alternative methods for accounting for wholesale inventories are the First In, First Out (FIFO) method and the Last in, First out (LIFO) method. We account for all wholesale inventories under the FIFO method. Two alternative methods for accounting for retail inventories are the retail method and the cost method. We account for all retail inventories under the cost method. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Interpretation Number 47 (FIN 47), Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. FIN 47 provides clarification regarding the meaning of the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. We are currently evaluating the impact of FIN 47 on our financial statements. In December 2003, The Securities Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (SAB 104), Revenue Recognition. SAB 104 expands previously issued guidance on the subject of Revenue Recognition and provides specific criteria which must be fulfilled to permit the recognition of revenue from transactions. We do not expect the issuance of SAB 104 to have a material effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial position. In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) No. 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP No. 109 2). FSP No. 109 2 provides guidance under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act) on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability. FSP No. 109 2 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS No. 109. We are currently evaluating the impact of FSP No. 109 2 on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R, Share Based Payment, a revision of FASB Statement No. 123. Under this standard, all forms of share based payment to employees, including stock options, would be treated as compensation and recognized in the income statement. This proposed statement would be effective for awards granted, modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We currently account for stock options under APB No. 25. The pro forma impact of expensing options, valued using the Black Scholes valuation model, is disclosed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is currently researching the appropriate valuation model to use for stock options. In connection with the issuance of SFAS 123R, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin number 107 (SAB 107) in March of 2005. SAB 107 provides implementation guidance for companies to use in their adoption of SFAS 123R. We are currently evaluating the effect of SFAS 123R and SAB 107 on our financial statements with the intent of implementing this standard in Fiscal 2007. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets. SFAS 153 is an amendment of Accounting Principles Board Opinion 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, and eliminates certain narrow differences between APB 29 and international accounting standards. SFAS 153 is effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 153 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. 52 Table of Contents In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 152, Accounting for Real Estate Time Sharing Transactions. SFAS 152 is an amendment of SFAS 66 and 67 and generally requires that real estate time sharing transactions be accounted for as non retail land sales. SFAS 152 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 152 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 151, Inventory costs. SFAS 151 is an amendment of Accounting Research Board Opinion number 43 and sets standards for the treatment of abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage. SFAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2004. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 151 on our financial statements. In October 2004, the FASB Emerging Issue Task Force issued its abstract No. 04 01 (EITF 04 01) Accounting for Pre existing Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination. EITF 04 01 addresses the appropriate accounting treatment for portions of the acquisition costs of an entity which may be deemed to apply to Elements of a pre existing business relationship between the acquiring company and the target company. EITF 04 01 is effective for combinations consummated after October 2004. It is therefore applicable to the pending Footwear acquisition discussed in Note 23. Historically, we had not assigned any value to pre existing business relationships reacquired in purchase transactions. The adoption of EITF 04 01 has no effect on historical financial statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities which was amended by FIN 46R in December, 2003. A variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. Historically, entities generally were not consolidated unless the entity was controlled through voting interests. FIN 46R changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. FIN 46R also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46R apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46R apply to existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after December 15, 2003. Also, certain disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. The adoption of FIN 46R required us to consolidate the assets and liabilities of RL Media. See Notes 2 and 4 to consolidated financial statements regarding Ralph Lauren Media consolidation and our interest in Ralph Lauren Media, LLC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Our policy allows for the use of derivative financial instruments for identifiable market risk exposures, including interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. During Fiscal 2005, there were significant fluctuations in the value of the Euro to Dollar exchange rate. In June 2002, we entered into a cross currency rate swap to minimize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the long term Euro debt and the impact of fluctuations in the interest rate on the fair value of the long term Euro debt. In May 2003, we terminated the cross currency rate swap, and entered into an interest rate swap, to minimize the impact of changes in the fair value of the Euro debt due to changes in EURIBOR, the benchmark interest rate. The following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices and theoretical pricing models obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities. These 53 Table of Contents quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We have assets and liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies related to international subsidiaries. At April 2, 2005, we had the following foreign exchange contracts outstanding: (i) to deliver 94.3 million in exchange for $124.3 million through Fiscal 2005 and (ii) to deliver 11,389 million in exchange for $99.6 million through Fiscal 2008. We believe that these financial instruments should not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should offset losses and gains on the assets, liabilities, and transactions being hedged. We are exposed to credit related losses if the counterparty to the financial instruments fails to perform its obligations. However, we do not expect the counterparty, which presently has high credit ratings, to fail to meet its obligations. Our primary foreign currency exposure relates to our Euro debt. As of April 2, 2005, the fair value of our fixed Euro debt was $306.9 million, based on its quoted market price as listed on the London Stock exchange and translated using Euro exchange rates in effect as of April 2, 2005. The potential increase in fair value of our fixed rate Euro debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in exchange rates would have been approximately $30.7 million at April 2, 2005. As of April 2, 2005, a hypothetical immediate 10% adverse change in exchange rates would have had a $6.5 million unfavorable impact over a one year period on our earnings and cash flows. Interest Rates Our primary interest rate exposure relates to our fixed rate debt. The potential decrease in fair value of our fixed rate Euro debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates would have been approximately $4.5 million at April 2, 2005. We employ a fair value hedging strategy utilizing interest rate swaps to effectively float a portion of our interest rate exposure on our fixed rate Euro debt. On April 6, 2004 and October 4, 2004, the company executed interest rate swaps to convert the fixed interest rate on an additional total of Euro 100 million of the Eurobonds to a floating rate. After the execution of this swap, approximately 22 million of Eurobonds remained at fixed interest rate. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis is a summary and should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes, which are included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. We use a 52 53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday nearest March 31. References to Fiscal 2005 represent the 52 week fiscal year ended April 2, 2005. References to Fiscal 2004 represent the 53 week fiscal year ended April 3, 2004, and references to Fiscal 2003 represent the 52 week fiscal year ended March 29, 2003. Overview We operate in three integrated segments: wholesale, retail and licensing. Wholesale consists of womens, mens and childrens apparel. Teams comprising design, merchandising, sales and production staff work together to develop product groupings that are organized to convey a variety of design concepts. This segment includes the Polo Ralph Lauren product lines as well as Lauren, Blue Label, Polo Golf, RLX Polo Sport, Womens Ralph Lauren Collection and Black Label, and Mens Purple Label Collection. Retail consists of our worldwide Ralph Lauren retail operations that sell our product through Ralph Lauren, Club Monaco full price and outlet stores and Rugby full price stores as well as Ralph Lauren Media, our 50% owned e commerce joint venture, which sells product over the Internet. Licensing consists of product, international and home licensing alliances, each of which pay us royalties based upon sales of our product, and are generally subject to minimum royalty payments. We work closely with our licensing partners to ensure that products are developed, marketed and distributed in a manner consistent with the distinctive perspective and lifestyle associated with our brand. Restatement of Previously Issued Financial Statements We have restated our prior years financial statements for the following items. As a result of the clarifications contained in the February 7, 2005 letter from the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to the Center for Public Company Audit Firms of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants regarding certain specific lease accounting issues, we initiated a review of the Companys lease accounting practices. Management and the Audit Committee of the Companys Board of Directors determined that our accounting practices were incorrect with respect to rent holiday periods and the classification of landlord incentives and the related amortization. We have made all appropriate adjustments to correct these errors for all periods presented. In periods prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we had recorded straight line rent expense for store operating leases over the related stores lease term beginning with the commencement date of store operations. Rent expense was not recognized during any build out period. To correct this practice, we have adopted a policy in which rent expense is recognized on a straight line over the stores lease term commencing with the start of the build out period (the effective lease commencement date). The adoption of this policy resulted in a reduction in operating income of $2.9 million for Fiscal 2004 and a $2.4 million increase in operating income for Fiscal 2003. Prior to the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, we had classified tenant allowances (amounts received from a landlord to fund leasehold improvement) as a reduction of property and equipment rather than as a deferred lease incentive liability. The amortization of these landlord incentives was originally recorded as a reduction in depreciation expense rather than as a reduction of rent expense. In addition, our statements of cash flow had originally reflected these incentives as a reduction of capital expenditures within cash flows from investing activities rather than as cash flows from operating activities. Correcting these items resulted in an increase to each of net property and equipment and deferred lease incentive liabilities of $11.4 million and $20.6 million, respectively, at April 3, 2004. Additionally, for each of the fiscal years in the two year period ended April 3, 2004, the reclassification of the amortization of deferred lease incentives resulted in a decrease to rent expense 32 Table of Contents and a corresponding increase to depreciation expense of $2.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively. A $5.5 million decrease was recorded to retained earnings as of March 30, 2002 as a result of this restatement. In January 2000, we formed Ralph Lauren Media, LLC as a joint venture with the National Broadcasting Company. Under this 30 year joint venture agreement, Ralph Lauren Media is owned 50% by the Company and 37.5% by NBC and 12.5% by ValueVision Media. We had used the equity method of accounting for our investment in the joint venture since its inception. On December 24, 2003, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (FASB) issued FIN 46R, which is applicable for financial statements issued for reporting periods ending after March 15, 2004. The Company considered the provisions of FIN 46R in its fiscal 2004 financial statements and made the determination that Ralph Lauren Media was a variable interest entity (VIE) under FIN 46R. At that time the Company also determined that it was not the primary beneficiary under FIN 46R and, therefore, was not required to consolidate the results of Ralph Lauren Media. Upon subsequent review the Company has now concluded that its determination in 2004 was incorrect and that consolidation of Ralph Lauren Media into the Companys financial statements was required as of April 3, 2004. The impact on the Companys balance sheet as of April 3, 2004 is to increase assets by approximately $18 million and liabilities by approximately $9 million and minority interest by approximately $9 million. Previously, the Company accounted for this joint venture using the equity method of accounting, under which we recognized our share of Ralph Lauren Medias operating results based on our share of ownership and the terms of the joint venture agreement. As a result, there is no impact from the consolidation on prior years reported earnings. We also corrected the classification of the net loss recorded on the disposal of property and equipment from the investing activities section to the operating activities section within the Statement of Cash Flows for Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003. Further, upon review of the Fiscal 2004 Statement of Cash Flows, we concluded that certain foreign exchange results previously classified as Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents and net investment in foreign subsidiaries should be classified as operating activities and have made these corrections as part of the restatement. See Notes 2 and 22 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K for a summary of the effects of the restatements of previously issued financial statements to reflect the above items. The accompanying Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations gives effect to these restatements. Fiscal 2005 Overall Results During Fiscal 2005, overall revenue increased $655.8 million, or 24.7%, primarily as a result of the acquisition of the Childrenswear business, the presence of the Lauren line in our wholesale segment for a full year and strong growth in our retail segment, partially offset by sales declines in our Mens wholesale business due to a planned reduction in off price sales. Our licensing revenue decreased $24.1 million, or 9.0%, as a result of loss of licensing income from the Lauren and Childrenswear labels. Gross profit increased $361.2 million, or 27.3%, and our gross margin as a percentage of sales (gross margin rate) increased to 51.0% from 49.9% in Fiscal 2004. The increasing gross margin rate reflects the benefits of advertising, improved product mix and a continued focus on inventory management, partially offset by decreases in licensing income as a result of the acquisition of the Lauren and Childrenswear lines. Operating expenses increased $349.7 million or 33.9%, primarily as a result of litigation charges recorded in the amount of $106.2 million and the addition of expenses associated with the Childrenswear business, a full years expenses for the Lauren business and increased operating expenses associated with our growth in retail sales. During Fiscal 2005, we recorded restructuring charges of $2.3 million. These charges are primarily composed of additional severance costs for the consolidation of our European business. 33 Table of Contents Our international operating results were affected by foreign exchange rate fluctuations. However, the increase in net sales due to the strengthening Euro and Canadian dollar was generally offset by a comparable increase in cost of sales and operating expenses. Balance Sheet Our financial position remains strong. Our cash and cash equivalents decreased to $350.5 million and our cash and cash equivalents net of debt position decreased $15.5 million, primarily as a result of the purchase of the Childrenswear business and an increase in our debt due to the strengthening of the Euro. Cash flow from operations increased by $168.4 million primarily as a result of increased sales and gross profits. We intend to pay the approximately $110 million purchase price for the pending purchase of our footwear licensee out of our cash and cash equivalents. Recent Developments As described in Item 1 BUSINESS Recent Developments and Item 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, we have recorded a reserve of $100.0 million in connection with our litigation with Jones Apparel Group, Inc. over the termination of the Lauren product line license previously held by Jones. On March 24, 2005, the Appellate Division of the New York Supreme Court affirmed the lower Courts orders in favor of Jones. We filed a motion with the Appellate Division for reargument and or permission to appeal its decision to the New York Court of Appeals, and on June 23, 2005, the Appellate Division denied our request for reargument but granted our motion for leave to appeal to the Court of Appeals. If the Court of Appeals does not reverse the Appellate Divisions decision, the case will go back to the lower court for a trial on damages. Although we intend to continue to defend the case vigorously, in light of the Appellate Divisions decision we recorded a charge of $100.0 million during Fiscal 2005 to establish a reserve for this litigation. This charge represents managements best estimate at this time of the loss incurred. No discovery has been held, and the ultimate outcome of this matter could differ materially from the reserved amount. Jones is seeking compensatory damages of $550.0 million plus punitive damages relating to our alleged tortuous interference in the non compete and confidentiality provisions of Jackwyn Nemerovs former employment agreement with Jones. If Jones were to be awarded the full amount of damages it seeks, the award would have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position. The royalties that we received pursuant to the Lauren license agreements and Ralph license agreements represented revenues of approximately $23.0 million and $3.9 million, respectively, in Fiscal 2004 prior to the termination of these licenses on December 31, 2003 and $37.4 million and $5.3 million respectively during Fiscal 2003. In total, royalties received from Jones (consisting solely of royalties from the Polo Jeans license agreements, since the termination of the Lauren and Ralph licenses), accounted for 7.2%, 17.2% and 27.2% of our aggregate licensing revenue for Fiscal 2005, Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003, respectively. As described in more detail in Note 21 to our consolidated financial statements included in this Form 10 K, we are subject to various claims relating to an alleged security breach of our retail point of sale system, including fraudulent credit card charges, the cost of replacing cards and related monitoring expenses and other related claims. We are unable to predict the extent to which further claims will be asserted. We have contested and will continue to vigorously contest the claims made against it and continues to explore its defenses and possible claims against others. We have established a reserve of $6.2 million on its balance sheet relating to this matter, representing managements best estimate at this time of the loss incurred. The ultimate outcome of this matter could differ from the amounts recorded. While that difference could be material to the results of operations for any affected reporting period, it is not expected to have a material impact on consolidated financial position or liquidity. In June 2003, one of our licensing partners, WestPoint Stevens, Inc., and certain of its affiliates (WestPoint) filed a voluntary petition for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. WestPoint produces bedding and bath product in our Home Collection. On December 19, 2003, the United States Bankruptcy Court approved an amended licensing agreement between WestPoint and 34 Table of Contents us, which provides for the same royalty rate and minimum royalties that are not materially lower than under the previous agreement. On June 24, 2005, American Real Estate Properties, LP, an entity controlled by investor Carl Icahn, won the U.S. Bankruptcy Court approved bidding process for WestPoints assets, subject to final confirmation at a hearing to be held August 17, 2005. The Company believes that the new owners will continue the relationship on satisfactory terms. The contract with WestPoint Stevens expires in December of 2005. Recent Acquisitions On May 23, 2005, the Company entered into a definitive agreement with Reebok International, Ltd to acquire all the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Ralph Lauren Footwear Co., Inc, the global licensee for mens, womens and childrens footwear, as well as certain foreign assets owned by affiliates of Reebok International Ltd (collectively, the Footwear Business). The purchase price for the acquisition of the Footwear Business will be approximately $110 million in cash payable at closing, subject to certain closing adjustments. Payment of the purchase price will be funded by cash on hand and lines of credit as required. In addition, the Footwear Licensee and certain of its affiliates have entered into a transition services agreement with us to provide a variety of operational, financial and information systems services over a period of twelve to eighteen months. The closing of the proposed transaction is subject to customary conditions, including the receipt of certain third party consents and the expiration or termination of the waiting period under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976. The closing of the transaction is anticipated to occur in July 2005. On July 2, 2004, we completed the acquisition of certain assets of RL Childrenswear Company, LLC for a purchase price of approximately $263.5 million including transaction costs. The purchase price includes deferred payments of $15 million over the next three years, and we have agreed to assume certain liabilities. Additionally, we agreed to pay up to an additional $5 million in contingent payments if certain sales targets are attained. During the third quarter, we recorded a $5 million liability for this contingent purchase payment because we believe it is probable the sales targets will be achieved. This amount was recorded as an increase in goodwill. RL Childrenswear Company, LLC was our licensee holding the exclusive licenses to design, manufacture, merchandise and sell newborn, infant, toddler and girls and boys clothing in the United States, Canada and Mexico. In connection with this acquisition, we recorded fair values for assets and liabilities as follows: inventory of $26.6 million, property and equipment of $7.5 million, intangible assets, consisting of non compete agreements, valued at $2.5 million and customer relationships, valued at $29.9 million, other assets of $1.0 million, goodwill of $208.3 million and liabilities of $12.3 million. The results of operations for the Childrenswear line for the period are included in the consolidated results of operations commencing July 2, 2004, for the year ended April 2, 2005. The following unaudited pro forma information assumes the Childrenswear acquisition had occurred on March 30, 2003. The pro forma information, as presented below, is not indicative of the results that would have been obtained had the transaction occurred March 30, 2003, nor is it indicative of the Companys future results. The unaudited pro forma information is presented based on the preliminary purchase price allocation. The final purchase price allocation and the resulting effect on net income may differ significantly from the unaudited pro forma amounts included herein (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts). The following pro forma amounts reflect adjustments for purchases made by us from Childrenswear, licensing royalties paid to us by Childrenswear, amortization of the non compete agreements, lost interest income on the cash used for the purchase and the income tax effect based upon unaudited pro forma effective tax rate of 35.5% in Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004. The unaudited pro forma information gives effect only to adjustments described above and does not reflect managements estimate of any anticipated cost savings or other benefits as a result of the acquisition. The unaudited pro forma amounts include material non recurring charges of approximately $7.4 million that are recorded within Cost of goods sold related to the write up to fair value of inventory as part of the preliminary purchase price allocation (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts). 35 Table of Contents For the Year Ended April 2, April 3, 2005 2004 (Unaudited) (Unaudited) Net revenue $ 3,359,168 $ 2,858,458 Net income 195,338 186,164 Net income per share Basic $ 1.92 $ 1.88 Net income per share Diluted $ 1.88 $ 1.84 Restructurings During Fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic review of our European businesses and formalized our plans to centralize and more efficiently consolidate our business operations. The major initiatives of the plan included the following: consolidation of our headquarters from five cities in three countries to one location, the consolidation of our European logistics operations to Italy and the migration of all European information systems to a standard global system. In connection with the implementation of this plan, the Company recorded a restructuring charge of $2.1 million, $7.9 million and $14.4 million during Fiscal 2005, Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003, respectively. $23.3 million had been paid through April 2, 2005 in connection with this implementation. The remaining balance which consists primarily of lease termination costs will be paid over the life of the lease. During Fiscal 2001, we implemented the 2001 Operational Plan. Due to real estate market factors that were less favorable than originally estimated, we recorded an additional $10.4 million charge during Fiscal 2004. The remaining balance which consists primarily of lease termination costs will be paid over the life of the lease. Results of Operations The table below sets forth results in millions of dollars and the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain items in our consolidated statements of income for our last three fiscal years: Fiscal Year Ended April 2, April 3, March 29, April 2, April 3, March 29, 2005 2004 2003 2005 2004 2003 Net sales $ 3,060.7 $ 2,380.9 $ 2,189.3 92.6 % 89.9 % 89.8 % Licensing revenue 244.7 268.8 250.0 7.4 % 10.1 % 10.2 % Net revenues 3,305.4 2,649.7 2,439.3 100.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Gross profit 1,684.5 1,323.3 1,207.6 51.0 % 49.9 % 49.5 % Selling, general and administrative expenses 1,382.5 1,032.9 902.4 41.8 % 39.0 % 37.0 % Restructuring charge 2.3 19.5 14.4 0.1 % 0.7 % 0.6 % Income from operations 299.7 270.9 290.8 9.1 % 10.2 % 11.9 % Foreign currency (gains) losses (6.1 ) 1.9 0.5 (0.2 )% Interest expense 6.4 10.0 13.5 0.2 % 0.4 % 0.6 % Income before provision for income taxes and Other expense (income) 299.4 259.0 276.8 9.1 % 9.8 % 11.3 % Provision for income taxes 107.4 93.9 101.1 3.3 % 3.5 % 4.1 % Other expense (income), net 1.6 (4.1 ) 0.0 % (0.1 )% Net income $ 190.4 $ 169.2 $ 175.7 5.8 % 6.4 % 7.2 % 36 Table of Contents Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Net Revenues. Net revenues for Fiscal 2005 were $3.3 billion, an increase of $655.8 million over net revenues for Fiscal 2004. Wholesale revenues primarily increased as a result of the sale of Lauren and Childrenswear products. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales elsewhere in our wholesale business primarily driven by planned reductions in off price sales in our mens, womens and European business as well as the loss of the Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones. The increase in net revenues was also caused by increases in our retail segment as a result of our improved comparable retail store sales, continued store expansion and the favorable impact of the strengthening Euro. Net revenues for our business segments are provided below (Dollars in thousands). Fiscal Year Ended April 2, April 3, Increase 2005 2004 (Decrease) % Change Net revenues: Wholesale $ 1,712,040 $ 1,210,397 $ 501,643 41.4 % Retail 1,348,645 1,170,447 178,198 15.2 % Licensing 244,730 268,810 (24,080 ) (9.0 )% Total Net Revenue $ 3,305,415 $ 2,649,654 $ 655,761 24.7 % Wholesale net sales the increase primarily reflects: incremental increase from the Lauren line of approximately $280.5 million in the current year due to the inclusion of a full years sales versus one quarters sales in the prior year; inclusion of sales from the newly acquired Childrenswear line of $180.2 million commencing July 2, 2004; a $51.2 million decrease in the domestic mens wholesale business, which resulted from a planned reduction in off price sales and a reduction in spring sales due to a planned reduction of sales to lower margin customers; and increases in the European wholesale business of approximately $37.4 million on a constant dollar basis, as well as a $28.4 million favorable impact due to a stronger Euro in the current period. Retail net sales the increase primarily reflects: a $21.2 million, or 5.5%, increase in comparable full price store sales and a $27.5 million, or 3.9%, increase in comparable outlet store sales. Sales increased $16.3 million, or 4.2%, in comparable full price stores and a $21.8 million, or 3.1%, in comparable outlet stores on a constant dollar basis. Excluding the extra week in Fiscal 2004, comparable store sales increased 6.1% and 4.9% in full price and outlet stores, respectively, on a constant dollar basis. Comparable store sales information includes both Ralph Lauren stores and Club Monaco stores. the inclusion of $60.6 million of sales as a result of consolidation of RL Media. worldwide store expansion. During Fiscal 2005, the Company added 30 stores and closed 13 stores. Our total store count at April 2, 2005 was 278 stores compared to 261 stores at April 3, 2004. the stronger Euro during the current year, which accounted for approximately $14.7 million of the increase in net sales. Licensing revenue the decrease primarily reflects: the elimination of $34.6 million of royalties from our domestic licensing business due to the acquisition of the Childrenswear business and a full year without royalties from the Lauren licensee. a $13.1 million increase in international licensing. 37 Table of Contents Gross Profit. Gross profit increased $361.2 million, or 27.3%, for Fiscal 2005 compared to Fiscal 2004. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 51.0% from 49.9% primarily as a result of improved margins in our wholesale and retail businesses driven by reduced markdowns and our inventory management initiatives. Partially offsetting these improvements is the loss of licensing revenues from the Lauren and Childrenswear lines. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A increased $349.7 million, or 33.9%, to $1.383 billion during Fiscal 2005 from $1.033 billion in Fiscal 2004. SG&A as a percent of net revenues increased to 41.8% from 39.0%. The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by: the charge of $100.0 million recorded in connection with the Jones litigation and the charge of $6.2 million recorded in connection with the credit card matter. higher selling salaries and related costs of $84.8 million, on a constant dollar basis, in connection with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion. approximately $19.8 million of the increase in SG&A was due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the Euro Fiscal 2005. expenses of $29.6 million as a result of the consolidation of Ralph Lauren Media. incremental expenses of $22.3 million associated with a full years activity in the Lauren wholesale business, exclusive of additional corporate and overhead expenses incurred and reduced royalty revenues received. expenses of $37.8 million associated with the newly acquired Childrenswear business. Restructuring Charge. We recorded restructuring charges of $2.3 million during Fiscal 2005, compared to restructuring charges of $19.6 million during Fiscal 2004. The Fiscal 2005 restructuring charge is primarily comprised of additional contract termination and severance costs related to the consolidation of our European business operations. Income (Loss) from Operations. Income from operations increased $28.8 million, or 10.6%, in Fiscal 2005 compared to Fiscal 2004. This increase was primarily driven by an increase in wholesale and retail operating profits that was partially offset by an increase in SG&A costs driven by the items noted above. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in the licensing segments profits due to the loss of the Lauren and Childrenswear royalties. Income from operations was not significantly impacted by the stronger Euro and Canadian dollar, because the increased sales resulting from exchange rate fluctuations were substantially offset by a comparable increase in expenses. Income from operations for our business segments are provided below (Dollars in thousands). Fiscal Year Ended April 2, April 3, Increase 2005 2004 (Decrease) % Change Income (Loss) from operations Wholesale $ 299,710 $ 143,080 $ 156,630 109.5 % Retail 82,788 55,717 27,071 48.6 % Licensing 159,537 191,575 (32,038 ) (16.7 )% 542,035 390,372 $ 151,663 38.9 % Less: Unallocated Corporate expense (133,809 ) (99,915 ) (33,894 ) (33.9 %) Unallocated legal and restructuring charges (108,541 ) (19,566 ) Income from operations $ 299,685 $ 270,891 Wholesale operating income increased primarily as a result of incremental net sales in our newly acquired Childrenswear business and a full year of activity in the Lauren business. 38 Table of Contents Retail operating income increased primarily as a result of increased net sales and improved gross profits as a percentage of net revenues. These increases were partially offset by the increase in selling salaries and related costs in connection with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion. Licensing income decreased primarily due to the loss of the Lauren and Childrens royalties. This decrease was partially offset by improvements in our international licensing business. Unallocated Corporate Expenses increased primarily as a result of increased stock compensation expense and increased bonus accrual resulting from our increased operating income. Foreign Currency (Gains) Losses. The effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a gain of $6.1 million during Fiscal 2005, compared to a $1.9 million loss during Fiscal 2004. These gains are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are converted to U.S. dollars. Interest Expense, Net. Interest expense decreased to $6.4 million in Fiscal 2005 from $10.0 million for Fiscal 2004. This decrease was due to the repayment of approximately $100.0 million of short term borrowings during Fiscal 2004, as well as decreased interest rates as a result of the interest rate swaps described in Liquidity and Capital Resources Derivative Instruments. Provision for Income Taxes. The effective tax rate was 35.9% for Fiscal 2005, compared to 36.2% for Fiscal 2004. Other Expense (Income), Net. Other expense (income) net was $1.6 million for Fiscal 2005. This reflects $6.4 million of income related to our 20% equity interest in Impact21, the company that holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan, net of $3.8 million of minority interest expense associated with our Japanese master license, both of which were acquired in February 2003 (excluding the additional 2% equity interest in the entity that holds the sublicenses that we acquired in May 2003). Also included in Fiscal 2005 is $4.2 million of minority interest expense for Ralph Lauren Media. Net Income. Net income increased for Fiscal 2005 to $190.4 million from $169.2 million for Fiscal 2004, or 5.8% and 6.4% of net revenues, respectively. Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis increased by $0.15 to $1.83 per share as a result of the increase in net income for the reasons previously discussed partially offset by an increase in diluted shares outstanding of 3.1 million due to the exercise of stock options, a higher average stock price and the award of restricted stock units to executives. Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 Net Revenues. Net revenues for Fiscal 2004 were $2.650 billion, an increase of $210.3 million over net revenues for Fiscal 2003. This increase was primarily due to increases in our retail segment as a result of our improved comparable retail store sales, continued store expansion and the favorable impact of the strengthening Euro and Canadian dollar. Also contributing to the sales increase was the 53rd week in Fiscal 2004 compared to 52 weeks in Fiscal 2003. The 53rd week was responsible for an estimated $39.5 million of the sales increase. Further influencing the increase in net revenues were overall increases in licensing revenues driven by the incremental effect of the consolidation of revenues from the Japanese master license and improved results in the footwear business. Additionally, wholesale revenues increased as a result of the sale of Lauren products commencing in the third quarter of fiscal year 2004. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales in our wholesale business primarily driven by planned reductions in off price sales in our 39 Table of Contents mens, womens and European business as well as the loss of the Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones. Net revenues for our business segments are provided below (dollars in thousands). Fiscal Year Ended April 3, March 29, Increase 2004 2003 (Decrease) % Change Net revenues: Wholesale $ 1,210,397 $ 1,187,363 $ 23,034 1.9 % Retail 1,170,447 1,001,958 168,489 16.8 % Licensing 268,810 250,019 18,791 7.5 % Total Net Revenue $ 2,649,654 $ 2,439,340 $ 210,314 8.6 % Wholesale net sales increased primarily due to: the addition of the Lauren line, which accounted for net sales of approximately $109.8 million in the current year, partially offset by: a $60.4 million decrease in the domestic mens wholesale business, which resulted from a planned reduction in off price sales and a reduction in spring sales due to a planned reduction of sales to lower margin customers. the elimination of the womens Ralph Lauren Sport line, which accounted for net sales of approximately $12.3 million in the prior year. decreases in the European wholesale business, primarily due to the soft economic conditions in Europe, of approximately $65.4 million on a constant dollar basis, offset by a $45.1 million favorable impact due to a stronger Euro in the current period. Retail net sales increased primarily as a result of: a $43.7 million, or 14.4%, increase in comparable full price store sales and a $48.8 million, or 7.6%, increase in comparable outlet store sales on a constant dollar basis. Excluding the extra week in Fiscal 2004, comparable store sales increased 12.2% and 5.7% in full price and outlet stores, respectively, on a constant dollar basis. Comparable store sales for the 53 weeks increased 18.0% and 8.8% for the full price stores and the outlet stores, respectively, while comparable store sales on a 52 week basis increased 15.8% for full price stores and 6.9% for outlet stores. Comparable store sales information includes both Ralph Lauren stores and Club Monaco stores. worldwide store expansion. During Fiscal 2004, the Company added 15 stores and closed 7 stores. Our total store count at April 3, 2004 was 261 stores compared to 253 stores at March 29, 2003. the stronger Euro and Canadian dollar in the current period, accounted for approximately $27.0 million of the increase in net sales. Licensing revenue the increase primarily reflects: a $27.5 million increase in international licensing primarily due to the incremental effect of the consolidation of revenues from the Japanese master license. $3.5 million increase in domestic licensing due to improvements in the footwear business. the loss of $15.8 million of Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones compared to the prior year. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased $115.7 million, or 9.6%, for Fiscal 2004 compared to Fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of the increases discussed above. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 49.9% from 49.5%. This increase reflects a change in business mix, with retail sales representing 44.2% of revenues in Fiscal 2004 compared to 41.1% in Fiscal 2003 and improved margins in our Ralph Lauren and Club Monaco retail stores. The increasing gross profit rate also reflects higher realized sales dollars resulting from a combination of improved product mix as well as the benefits of advertising and targeted marketing. The 40 Table of Contents rate improvement also reflects a continued focus on inventory management. Although our inventory balance at April 2, 2005 is approximately the same as it was at April 3, 2004, this primarily reflects the appreciation of the Euro, inventories related to our Lauren wholesale business and increased levels of inventory related to our retail growth offset by decreases in inventory in other lines of business. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A increased $130.6 million, or 14.5%, to $1.033 billion during Fiscal 2004 from $902.3 million during Fiscal 2003. SG&A as a percent of net revenues increased to 39.0% from 37.0%. The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by: Higher selling salaries and related costs of $48.7 million, exclusive of the effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations in connection with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion. Approximately $30.4 million of the increase in SG&A was due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the Euro and Canadian dollar in Fiscal 2004. Expenses of $28.1 million associated with the Lauren wholesale business, exclusive of additional corporate and overhead expenses incurred and reduced royalty revenues received. $19.0 million of increased international licensing SG&A primarily due to the consolidation of incremental expenses relating to the Japanese master license. Restructuring Charge. We recorded restructuring charges of $19.6 million during Fiscal 2004, compared to restructuring charges of $14.4 million during Fiscal 2003. The Fiscal 2004 restructuring charge is comprised of an additional $10.4 million for lease termination costs primarily associated with two Club Monaco retail properties included in our 2001 Operational Plan due to real estate market factors that were less favorable than originally estimated, $7.9 million for additional contract termination and severance costs related to the consolidation of our European business operations (approximately $6.7 million for the wholesale business and $1.2 million for the retail business) and $1.3 million for lease termination and asset write offs associated with the March 2004 decision to close our RRL stores. The Fiscal 2003 restructuring charge of $14.4 million related to severance and contract termination costs in connection with the consolidation of our European business operations. Income (Loss) from Operations. Income from operations decreased $20.0 million, or 6.9%, in Fiscal 2004 compared to Fiscal 2003. This decrease was primarily driven by a decrease in wholesale operating profits, restructuring charges, the decrease in Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones following the license termination in December 2003 and the start up expenses associated with the Lauren line. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in the retail segments profits. Income from operations was not significantly impacted by the stronger Euro and Canadian dollar in Fiscal 2004 because the increased sales resulting from exchange rate fluctuations were substantially offset by a comparable increase in expenses. Income from operations for our business segments are provided below (Dollars in thousands). Fiscal Year Ended April 3, March 29, Increase 2004 2003 (Decrease) % Change Income (Loss) from operations Wholesale $ 143,080 $ 166,016 $ (22,936 ) (13.8 )% Retail 55,717 30,707 25,010 81.4 % Licensing 191,575 200,189 (8,614 ) (4.3 )% 390,372 396,912 $ (6,540 ) (1.6 )% Less: Unallocated Corporate expense (99,915 ) (91,614 ) (8,301 ) (9.1 )% Unallocated restructuring charge (19,566 ) (14,443 ) Income from operations $ 270,891 $ 290,855 41 Table of Contents Wholesale operating income decreased primarily as a result of decreased net sales in our domestic mens business and European wholesale operations. The incremental effect of Lauren sales in the fourth quarter on our wholesale business income from operations was largely offset by start up and ordinary operating expenses associated with the Lauren wholesale business. Retail operating income increased primarily as a result of increased net sales and improved gross profits as a percentage of net revenues. These increases were partially offset by the increase in selling salaries and related costs in connection with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion. Licensing income decreased primarily due to the loss of the Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones. This decrease was partially offset by improvements in the footwear business and by the inclusion of the operations of the Japanese Master License. Foreign Currency (Gains) Losses. The effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss of $1.9 million during Fiscal 2004, compared to a $0.5 million loss during Fiscal 2003. These losses primarily related to transaction losses on unhedged inventory purchases and royalty payments in Europe resulting from increases in the value of the Euro compared to the dollar. These losses are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are converted to U.S. dollars. In the prior period, these losses primarily related to transaction losses on the unhedged portion of our Euro denominated debt caused by appreciation of the Euro until we entered into the cross currency swap in June 2002, which were partially offset by $1.3 million of gains recorded on the Japanese forward contracts that we entered into in November of 2002. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $10.0 million in Fiscal 2004 from $13.5 million for Fiscal 2003. This decrease was due to the repayment of approximately $100.0 million of short term borrowings during Fiscal 2004, as well as decreased interest rates as a result of the May 2003 interest rate swap described in Liquidity and Capital Resources Commitments Derivative Instruments. Provision for Income Taxes. The effective tax rate was 36.2% for Fiscal 2004 compared to 36.5% for Fiscal 2003. Other (Income) Expense, Net. Other (income) expense, net was $(4.1) million for Fiscal 2004. This reflects $5.5 million of income related to the 20% equity interest in the company that holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan, net of $1.4 million of minority interest expense associated with our Japanese master license, both of which were acquired in February 2003 (except for the additional 2% equity interest in the entity that holds the sublicenses that we acquired in May 2003). Net Income. Net income decreased for Fiscal 2004 to $169.2 million from $175.7 million for Fiscal 2003, or 6.4% and 7.2% of net revenues, respectively. Earnings per share on a fully diluted basis decreased by $0.09 to $1.68 per share as a result of the decrease in net income for the reasons previously discussed and an increase in diluted shares outstanding of 1.7 million due to the exercise of stock options, a higher average stock price and the award of restricted stock units to executives. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary ongoing cash requirements are to fund growth in working capital (primarily accounts receivable and inventory) to support projected sales increases, acquisitions, construction and renovation of shop within shops, investment in the technological upgrading of our distribution centers and information systems, expenditures related to retail store expansion, acquisitions, dividends, and other corporate activities. Sources of liquidity to fund ongoing and future cash requirements include cash flows from operations, cash and cash equivalents, credit facilities and other borrowings. We anticipate funding the approximately $110 million purchase price of the pending Footwear Business through the use of our cash and cash equivalents. 42 Table of Contents Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 We ended Fiscal 2005 with $350.5 million in cash and cash equivalents and $291.0 million of debt outstanding compared to $352.3 million and $277.3 million of cash and cash equivalents and debt outstanding, respectively, at April 3, 2004. This represents a $15.5 million decrease in our cash net of debt position over the last twelve months which is primarily attributable to the following factors: the use of $241.9 million of cash to purchase the Childrenswear business and an increase in Euro debt of $13.6 million as a result of the strengthening of the Euro, partially offset by increased cash flow from operations and increased proceeds received from the exercise of stock options. Additionally, capital expenditures were $174.1 million for Fiscal 2005 compared to $126.3 million in Fiscal 2004. As of April 2, 2005, we had $291.0 million outstanding in long term Euro debt based on the year end Euro exchange rate, an increase of $13.6 million from Fiscal 2004. The increase was entirely due to changes in the Euro to Dollar exchange rate. We were also contingently liable for $29.8 million in outstanding letters of credit primarily related to commitments for the purchase of inventory. The weighted average interest rate on our borrowings at April 2, 2005 was 3.4%. Accounts receivable increased $14.0 million primarily as a result of the inclusion in Fiscal 2005 $30.4 million in Childrenswear accounts receivable and a $7.4 million impact of the strengthening Euro, partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable in our Lauren and mens divisions resulting from the timing of payments. Inventories increased $56.9 million in Fiscal 2005. The inception of the Childrenswear line was responsible for a $23.4 million increase, our mens business had an increase in inventory of $17.8 million, primarily as a result of increased summer bookings. The strengthening of the Euro caused a $6.7 million increase in inventory. Accounts payable decreased $4.5 million compared to Fiscal 2004 primarily as result of a $12.7 million decrease in our Lauren business, partially offset by increases in other areas. Accrued expenses increased $129.1 million from Fiscal 2004, primarily as a result of the accrual of $100.0 million for a reserve relating to the Jones litigation as well as the addition of the Childrenswear label and increases in Europe due to the timing of year end invoice receipts. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $382.0 million during Fiscal 2005 compared to $213.6 million in Fiscal 2004. This $168.4 million increase in cash flow was driven primarily by the year over year increases in sales and gross profit. During Fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic review of our European business and formalized our plans to centralize and more efficiently consolidate our business operations. In connection with the implementation of this plan, we had total cash outlays of approximately $6.2 million during the year ended April 2, 2005. We also had cash outlays of $2.4 million during Fiscal 2005 in connection with our 2001 restructuring plan, primarily related to lease termination costs. It is expected that the remaining liabilities of both plans will be paid accordance with contract terms. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $417.4 million in Fiscal 2005, as compared to $134.5 million in Fiscal 2004. Both the Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004 net cash used primarily reflected capital expenditures related to retail expansion and upgrading our systems and facilities, as well as shop within shop expenditures. The Fiscal 2005 net cash used also reflects $241.9 million for the purchase of our Childrenswear business. Our anticipated capital expenditures for Fiscal 2006 approximate $175 million. Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $31.5 million in Fiscal 2005 compared to $76.4 million used in Fiscal 2004. Cash provided by financing activities during Fiscal 2005, consisted of the payment of $21.7 million in dividends, offset by proceeds of $54.3 million from the exercise of stock options. Cash used during Fiscal 2004 primarily consisted of net repayment of short term borrowings of $100.9 million and the payment of $14.8 million in dividends, partially offset by the $40.4 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. 43 Table of Contents Fiscal 2004 Compared to Fiscal 2003 We ended Fiscal 2004 with $352.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and $277.3 million of debt outstanding compared to $343.6 million and $349.4 million of cash and cash equivalents and debt outstanding, respectively, at March 29, 2003. This represents a $80.8 million increase in our cash net of debt position over the last twelve months which is primarily attributable to the following factors: (i) reduced spending on acquisitions and investments, (ii) increased proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, (iii) partially offset by reduced cash flows from operations and an increase in Euro debt of $28.9 million as a result of the strengthening of the Euro. Additionally, capital expenditures were $126.3 million for Fiscal 2004 compared to $102.4 million in Fiscal 2003. As of April 3, 2004, we had $277.3 million outstanding in long term Euro debt based on the year end Euro exchange rate, an increase of $28.9 million from Fiscal 2003. The increase was entirely due to changes in the Euro to Dollar exchange rate. We were also contingently liable for $35.3 million in outstanding letters of credit primarily related to commitments for the purchase of inventory. The weighted average interest rate on our borrowings at April 2, 2005 was 3.8%. Accounts receivable increased $65.9 million primarily as a result of the inception of sales under the Lauren label and the strengthening of the Euro. $86.5 million of the increase was due to Lauren and $13.2 million was due to the change in the value of the Euro. These increases were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable in our other wholesale divisions resulting from sales decreases and the timing of payments. Inventories decreased $9.4 million in Fiscal 2004. The inception of the Lauren line was responsible for a $34.1 million increase and the strengthening of the Euro caused a $14.3 million increase in inventory. These increases were more than offset by reductions in inventory in our retail and Mens wholesale business as a result of improvements in our supply chain forecasting and management and reduced inventory requirements in our mens business as a result of planned reductions in sales. Other current assets increased $34.7 million from Fiscal 2003 primarily as a result of increases in European Value Added Tax receivables and the effect of the timing of the fiscal year end on prepaid items. Accounts payable increased $7.5 million compared to Fiscal 2003 primarily as result of the addition of the Lauren line partially offset by reductions in our mens line due to a decrease in inventory purchases and reductions in Europe due to the timing of year end invoice receipts. Accrued expenses increased $80.6 million primarily as a result of the addition of the Lauren line, increases in the European Value Added Tax payable, and increases in Europe due to the timing of year end invoice receipts. Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $213.6 million during Fiscal 2004, compared to $286.2 million in Fiscal 2003. This $72.6 million decrease in cash flow was driven primarily by the year over year changes in working capital described above and the decrease in net income of $6.5 million. During Fiscal 2003, we completed a strategic review of our European business and formalized our plans to centralize and more efficiently consolidate its business operations. In connection with the implementation of this plan, we had total cash outlays of approximately $13.3 million during the year ended April 3, 2004. We also had cash outlays of $8.3 million during Fiscal 2004 in connection with our 2001 restructuring plan, primarily related to lease termination costs. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $134.5 million in Fiscal 2004, as compared to $183.5 million in Fiscal 2003. Both the Fiscal 2004 and Fiscal 2003 net cash used primarily reflected capital expenditures related to retail expansion and upgrading our systems and facilities, as well as shop within shop expenditures. The Fiscal 2004 net cash used also reflects $5.4 million for an additional 2% equity interest in Impact21, the company that holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan, and an additional $3.5 million primarily for additional transaction costs to acquire a 50% interest in the Japanese master license, offset by $8.9 million of cash resulting from the 44 Table of Contents consolidation of RL Media, $1.0 million for an additional payment on the first earn out payment calculation in connection with the PRL Fashions of Europe SRL acquisition and $7.5 million for the acquisition in November 2003 of a license for the use of trademarks. Fiscal 2003 net cash used, reflects $78 million primarily for the acquisition of a 50% interest in the Japanese Master license and an 18% equity interest in Impact21, the company holding the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens, and jeans business in Japan. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $76.4 million in Fiscal 2004 compared to $16.7 million in Fiscal 2003. Cash used in financing activities during Fiscal 2004, consisted of the net repayment of short term borrowings of $100.9 million and the payment of $14.8 million in dividends, partially offset by proceeds of $40.4 million from the exercise of stock options. Cash used during Fiscal 2003 primarily consisted of net repayments of borrowings of $19.7 million and repurchases of common stock totaling $4.7 million, partially offset by $7.7 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Credit Facilities and Other In March 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, subject to market conditions, of up to $100.0 million of our Class A common stock. Share repurchases were to be made in the open market over a two year period. The Board of Directors has extended the stock repurchase program through April 1, 2006. Shares acquired under the repurchase program are used for stock option programs and for other corporate purposes. As of April 2, 2005, we had repurchased 4.1 million shares of our Class A common stock at an aggregate cost of $77.5 million. On February 1, 2005, our Board of Directors approved an additional stock repurchase plan which allows for the repurchase of up to an additional $100 million in our stock. No repurchases have been made under this plan, which does not have a termination date. In November 1999, we issued Euro 275.0 million of 6.125% notes due November 2006. Our Euro debt is listed on the London Stock Exchange. The net proceeds from the Euro offering were $281.5 million, based on the Euro exchange rate on the issuance date. Interest on the Euro debt is payable annually. A portion of these net proceeds was used to acquire Poloco S.A.S. (our principal European subsidiary), and the remaining net proceeds were retained for general corporate purposes. Through Fiscal 2005, we had repurchased Euro 47.7 million, or $43.6 million, based on Euro exchange rates at the time of repurchase of our outstanding Euro debt. Prior to October 6, 2004, we had a credit facility with a syndicate of banks consisting of a $300.0 million revolving line of credit, subject to increase to $375.0 million, which was available for direct borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit. It was scheduled to mature on November 18, 2005. On October 6, 2004, we, in substance, expanded and extended this bank credit facility by entering into a new credit agreement, dated as of that date, with JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent, The Bank of New York, Fleet National Bank, SunTrust Bank and Wachovia Bank National Association, as Syndication Agents, J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., as sole Bookrunner and Sole Lead Arranger, and a syndicate of lending banks that included each of the lending banks under the prior credit agreement (the New Credit Facility). The New Credit Facility, which is otherwise substantially on the same terms as the prior credit facility, provides for a $450.0 million revolving line of credit, subject to increase to $525.0 million, which is available for direct borrowings and the issuance of letters of credit. It will mature on October 6, 2009. As of April 2, 2005, we had no direct borrowings outstanding under the New Credit Facility but were contingently liable for $29.8 million in outstanding letters of credit related primarily to commitments for the purchase of inventory. We incur a financing charge of ten basis points per month on the average monthly balance of these outstanding letters of credit. Direct borrowings under the New Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to (i) the higher of (x) the weighted average overnight Federal funds rate, as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, plus one half of one percent, and (y) the prime commercial lending rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank in effect from time to time, or (ii) the LIBO Rate (as defined in the New Credit Facility) in effect from time to time, as adjusted for the Federal Reserve Boards Eurocurrency Liabilities maximum reserve percentage, and a margin based on our then current credit ratings. 45 Table of Contents The New Credit Facility requires us to maintain certain financial covenants, including: a minimum ratio of consolidated Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization and Rent (EBITDAR) to Consolidated Interest Expense (as such terms are described in the New Credit Facility); and a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt (as defined in the New Credit Facility) to EBITDAR. The New Credit Facility also contains covenants that, subject to specified exceptions, restrict our ability to: incur additional debt; incur liens and contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets, including equity interests; merge with or acquire other companies, liquidate or dissolve; engage in businesses that are not a related line of business; make loans, advances or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make investments. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the New Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the New Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The New Credit Facility specifies a number of events of default (many of which are subject to applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure to make timely principal and interest payments or to satisfy the covenants, including the financial covenants described above. Additionally, the New Credit Facility provides that an event of default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren and related entities fail to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power of our common stock. As of April 2, 2005, the Company was in compliance with all financial and non financial debt covenants. In Fiscal 2003, the Board of Directors initiated a dividend program consisting of quarterly cash dividends of $0.05 per outstanding share, or $0.20 per outstanding share on an annual basis, on our common stock. Dividends of $0.05 per outstanding share declared to stockholders of record at the close of business on July 2, 2004, October 1, 2004, December 20, 2004 and April 1, 2005 were paid on July 16, 2004, October 15, 2004, January 14, 2005 and April 15, 2005, respectively. We expect that cash flow from operations will continue to be sufficient to fund our current level of operations, capital requirements, cash dividends and our stock repurchase plan. However, in the event of a material acquisition, material contingencies or material adverse business developments, we may need to draw on our credit facility or other potential sources of borrowing. As previously discussed, our ability to borrow under our credit facility is subject to our maintenance of financial and other covenants. As of April 2, 2005, we had no direct borrowings under the credit facility and were in compliance with our covenants. With respect to pending or threatened litigation, the only matter which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and capital resources is the litigation with Jones Apparel Group, Inc., in which Jones is seeking, among other things, compensatory damages of $550 million and unspecified punitive damages. See Item 3 LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. As noted above, we recorded a reserve of $100 million in connection with this matter during Fiscal 2005. We continue to believe that this matter is unlikely to have a material adverse effect on our liquidity or capital resources or our ability to borrow under the credit facility. 46 Table of Contents Commitments The following table summarizes the Companys contractual cash obligations by period as of April 2, 2005: Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years Thereafter Total (Dollars in thousands) Inventory purchase commitments $ 466,964 $ $ $ $ 466,964 Long term Euro debt 17,821 308,781 326,602 Capitalized leases 1,046 1,314 2,360 Operating leases 121,992 235,803 200,945 580,696 1,139,436 Additional acquisition purchase price payments 15,000 15,000 Other 2,150 3,700 1,250 7,100 Total $ 624,973 $ 549,598 $ 202,195 $ 580,696 $ 1,957,462 The long term Euro debt cash obligation disclosed above includes the principal amount and the interest payable at the 6.125% fixed rate. We have entered into interest rate swaps, which effectively convert the interest rate on an aggregate of Euro 205.2 million of the debt to a weighted average floating rate equal to EURIBOR plus 0.738%. The remaining Euro 22.1 million of fixed rate debt (or such lesser amount should any of the debt be repurchased) incurs interest of Euro 1.3 million per annum until the repayment date of the loan. Derivative Instruments. In June 2002, we entered into a cross currency rate swap which was scheduled to terminate in November 2006. The cross currency rate swap converted 105.2 million, 6.125% fixed rate borrowings into $100.0 million, LIBOR plus 1.24% variable rate borrowings. We entered into the cross currency rate swap to minimize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on both principal and interest payments on our long term Euro debt, and to minimize the impact of changes in the fair value of the Euro debt due to changes in LIBOR, the benchmark interest rate. The swap was designated as a fair value hedge under SFAS No. 133. Hedge ineffectiveness was measured as the difference between the respective gains or losses recognized in earnings from the changes in the fair value of the cross currency rate swap and the Euro debt. In May 2003, we terminated the cross currency rate swap and entered into an interest rate swap that will terminate in November 2006. The interest rate swap is being used to convert 105.2 million, 6.125% fixed rate borrowings into 105.2 million, EURIBOR minus 1.55% variable rate borrowings. We entered into the interest rate swap to minimize the impact of changes in the fair value of the Euro debt due to changes in EURIBOR, the benchmark interest rate. The swap had been designated as a fair value hedge under SFAS No. 133. Hedge ineffectiveness is measured as the difference between the respective gains or losses recognized in earnings from the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and the Euro debt resulting from changes in the benchmark interest rate, and was de minimis for Fiscal 2005. In addition, we have designated the entire principal of the Euro debt as a hedge of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary. As a result, changes in the fair value of the Euro debt resulting from changes in the Euro rate are reported net of income taxes in Accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated financial statements as an unrealized gain or loss on foreign currency hedges. On April 6, 2004 and October 4, 2004, we executed additional interest rate swaps to convert the fixed interest rate on an additional Euro 100 million of the Eurobonds to a floating rate (EURIBOR based). After the execution of these swaps, approximately Euro 22 million of the Eurobonds remained at a fixed interest rate. We enter into forward foreign exchange contracts as hedges relating to identifiable currency positions to reduce our risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inventory and intercompany royalty payments. Gains and losses on these contracts are deferred and recognized as adjustments to either the basis of those assets or foreign exchange gains/losses, as applicable. At April 2, 2005, we had the following foreign exchange contracts outstanding: (i) to deliver Euro 94.3 million in exchange for $124.3 million through Fiscal 2005 and (ii) to deliver 11,389 million Japanese Yen in exchange for $99.6 million through Fiscal 2008. At April 2, 2005, the 47 Table of Contents fair value of these contracts resulted in unrealized gain and loss, net of taxes of $1.8 million and $8.2 million, for the Euro forward contracts and Japanese Yen forward contracts, respectively. To the extent that any derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, they are recorded at fair value, with all gains or losses recognized immediately in the current period earnings. In November 2002, we entered into forward contracts on 6.2 billion Japanese Yen that terminated in February 2003. While these transactions did not qualify for hedge accounting under SFAS No. 133, we entered into these forward contracts to minimize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the Japanese Yen denominated purchase price described in the agreements related to the purchase of a 50% interest in the Japanese master license and an 18% equity interest in the company which holds the sublicenses for the Polo Ralph Lauren mens, womens and jeans business in Japan, which were consummated during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2003. We recognized $2.4 million of foreign currency gains on this transaction, which are recorded in foreign currency (gains) losses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We recognize gains or losses in connection with our foreign currency contracts when the cash flows they hedge take place. We recognized $10.9 million in forward losses in Fiscal 2005, and $1.9 million in Fiscal 2004 in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These charges are recorded as components of cost of sales and royalty expense in the Consolidated statement of income. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. We do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements or unconsolidated special purpose entities. Seasonality of Business Our business is affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments to retail customers and key vacation travel and holiday shopping periods in the retail segment. As a result of the growth in our retail operations and other changes in our business, historical quarterly operating trends and working capital requirements may not be indicative of future performances. In addition, fluctuations in sales and operating income in any fiscal quarter may be affected by the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and other events affecting retail sales. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Significant accounting policies employed by the Company, including the use of estimates, are presented in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Critical accounting policies are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and the results of operations, and require managements most difficult, subjective and complex judgements as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. The Companys most critical accounting policies, discussed below, pertain to revenue recognition, accounts receivable, inventories, goodwill, other long lived intangible assets, income taxes, accrued expenses and derivative instruments. In applying such policies, management must use some amounts that are based upon its informed judgements and best estimates. Estimates, by their nature, are based on judgements and available information. The estimates that we make are based upon historical factors, current circumstances and the experience and judgement of our management. We evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis and may employ outside experts to assist in our evaluations. Changes in such estimates, based on more accurate future information, may affect amounts reported in future periods. We are not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances which would result in different amounts being reported that would materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. 48 Table of Contents Revenue Recognition Revenue within our wholesale operations is recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to customers. Wholesale revenue is recorded net of returns, discounts, allowances and operational chargebacks. Returns and allowances require pre approval from management. Discounts are based on trade terms. Estimates for end of season allowances are based on historic trends, seasonal results, an evaluation of current economic conditions and retailer performance. We review and refine these estimates on a quarterly basis based on current experience, trends and retailer performance. Our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. Retail store revenue is recognized net of estimated returns at the time of sale to consumers. Licensing revenue is initially recorded based upon contractually guaranteed minimum levels and adjusted as actual sales data is received from licensees. During the year ending April 2, 2005 and April 3, 2004, we reduced revenues and credited customer accounts for end of season customer allowances, operational chargebacks and returns as follows: Year Ended April 2, April 3, 2005 2004 Beginning reserve balance $ 90,269 $ 48,432 Amount expensed 265,340 213,645 Amount credited against customer accounts (256,730 ) (171,808 ) Foreign currency translation 1,122 Ending reserve balance $ 100,001 $ 90,269 Our provisions and write offs against the reserves offsetting accounts receivable increased in fiscal 2005 due to the large increase in wholesale sales and the promotional retail environment. Ending reserve balances have increased for substantially the same reasons. We require that a store be open a full fiscal year before we include it in the computation of same store sales change. Stores that are closed during the fiscal year are excluded. Stores that are relocated or enlarged are also excluded until they have been in their new location for a full fiscal year. Income Taxes Income taxes are accounted for under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. In accordance with SFAS No. 109, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, as measured by statutory tax rates that are expected to be in effect in the periods when the deferred tax assets and liabilities are expected to be settled or realized. Significant judgement is required in determining the worldwide provisions for income taxes. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. It is our policy to establish provisions for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities. We established the provisions based upon managements assessment of exposure associated with permanent tax differences and tax credits. The tax provisions are analyzed periodically and adjustments are made as events occur that warrant adjustments to those provisions. Accounts Receivable, Net In the normal course of business, we extend credit to our wholesale customers that satisfy pre defined credit criteria. Accounts receivable, net, as shown on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, is net of the following allowances and reserves. An allowance for doubtful accounts is determined through analysis of the aging of accounts receivable at the date of the consolidated financial statements, assessments of collectibility based on an evaluation of historic and anticipated trends, the financial condition of the Companys customers, and an evaluation of the 49 Table of Contents impact of economic conditions. Expenses of $6.0 million were recorded as an allowance for uncollectible accounts during fiscal 2005. The amounts written off against customer accounts during fiscal 2005 totaled $2.1 million, and the balance in this reserve was $11.0 million as of April 2, 2005. A reserve for trade discounts is established based on open invoices where trade discounts have been extended to customers and is treated as a reduction of sales. Estimated customer end of season allowances (also referred to as customer markdowns) are included as a reduction of sales. These provisions are based on retail sales performance, seasonal negotiations with our customers as well as historic deduction trends and an evaluation of current market conditions. Our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. (See Revenue Recognition above) A reserve for operational chargebacks represents various deductions by customers relating to individual shipments. This reserve, net of expected recoveries, is included as a reduction of sales. The reserve is based on chargebacks received as of the date of the financial statements and past experience. Our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. (See Revenue Recognition above) Costs associated with potential returns of products are included as a reduction of sales. These reserves are based on current information regarding retail performance, historical experience and an evaluation of current market conditions. Our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. (See Revenue Recognition above) Inventories Inventories are valued at the lower of cost First in, First out, (FIFO), method, or market. We continually evaluate the composition of our inventories assessing slow turning, ongoing product as well as prior seasons fashion product. Market value of distressed inventory is determined based on historical sales trends for the category of inventory involved, the impact of market trends and economic conditions. Estimates may differ from actual results due to quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions. We review our inventory position on a quarterly basis at a minimum and adjust our estimates based on revised projections and current market conditions. If economic conditions worsen, we incorrectly anticipate trends or unexpected events occur, our estimates could be proven overly optimistic, and required adjustments could materially adversely affect future results of operations. Our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. Goodwill, Other Intangibles, Net and Long Lived Assets SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives no longer be amortized, but rather be tested, at least annually, for impairment. This pronouncement also requires that intangible assets with finite lives be amortized over their respective lives to their estimated residual values, and reviewed for impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. During fiscal 2005, there have been no material impairment losses recorded in connection with the assessment of the carrying value of long lived and intangible assets. The recoverability of the carrying values of all long lived assets with definite lives is reevaluated when changes in circumstances indicate the assets value may be impaired. In evaluating an asset for recoverability, we use our best estimate of the future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition. If the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset, an impairment loss, equal to the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the asset, is recognized. In determining the future cash flows, we take various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the impact of more experienced store managers, the impact of increased local advertising and the emphasis on store cost controls. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, there may be future impairments in the event the future cash flows do not meet expectations. During the year ended April 2, 2005, we recorded a $1.3 million impairment charge related to the fixed assets at three Club Monaco retail locations. 50 Table of Contents Accrued Expenses Accrued expenses for employee insurance, workers compensation, profit sharing, contracted advertising, professional fees and other outstanding obligations are assessed based on claims experience and statistical trends, open contractual obligations, and estimates based on projections and current requirements. If these trends change significantly, then actual results would likely be impacted. Our historical estimates of these costs and our provisions have not differed materially from actual results. Derivative Instruments SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted, requires that each derivative instrument (including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts) be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability and measured at its fair value. The statement also requires that changes in the derivatives fair value be recognized currently in earnings in either income (loss) from continuing operations or Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), depending on whether the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting treatment. We use foreign currency forward contracts for the specific purpose of hedging the exposure to variability in forecasted cash flows associated primarily with inventory purchases mainly for our European businesses, royalty payments from our Japanese licensee, and other specific activities. These instruments are designated as cash flow hedges and, in accordance with SFAS No. 133, to the extent the hedges are highly effective, the changes in fair value are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of related tax effects, with the corresponding asset or liability recorded in the balance sheet. The ineffective portion of the cash flow hedge, if any, is recognized in current period earnings. Amounts recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income are reflected in current period earnings when the hedged transaction affects earnings. If the relative values of the currencies involved in the hedging activities were to move dramatically, such movement could have a significant impact on our results of operations. We are not aware of any reasonably likely events or circumstances which would result in different amounts being reported that would materially affect our financial condition or results of operations. Hedge accounting requires that at inception and at the beginning of each hedge period, we justify an expectation that the hedge will be highly effective. This effectiveness assessment involves an estimation of the probability of the occurrence of transactions for cash flow hedges. The use of different assumptions and changing market conditions may impact the results of the effectiveness assessment and ultimately the timing of when changes in derivative fair values and underlying hedged items are recorded in earnings. We hedge our net investment position in subsidiaries which conduct business in Euros by borrowing directly in foreign currency and designating a portion of our Euro denominated debt as a hedge of net investments. Under SFAS No. 133, changes in the fair value of these instruments are immediately recognized in foreign currency translation, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), to offset the change in the value of the net investment being hedged. Inflation The rate of inflation over the past few years has not had a significant impact on our sales or profitability. Our significant accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 to Our Consolidated Financial Statements. Alternative Accounting Methods In certain instances, accounting principles generally accepted in the United States allow for the selection of alternative accounting methods. Our significant policies that involve the selection of alternative methods are accounting for stock options and inventories. Two alternative methods for accounting for stock options are available, the intrinsic value method and the fair value method. We use the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options, and 51 Table of Contents accordingly, no compensation expense has been recognized. Beginning in Fiscal 2007, we will be required to expense the fair value of stock options granted to employees (see discussion below). Under the fair value method, the determination of the pro forma amounts involves several assumptions including option life and future volatility. If the fair value method were used, diluted earnings per share for Fiscal 2004 would decrease approximately 10%. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Two alternative methods for accounting for wholesale inventories are the First In, First Out (FIFO) method and the Last in, First out (LIFO) method. We account for all wholesale inventories under the FIFO method. Two alternative methods for accounting for retail inventories are the retail method and the cost method. We account for all retail inventories under the cost method. Recent Accounting Pronouncements In March 2005, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards Interpretation Number 47 (FIN 47), Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations. FIN 47 provides clarification regarding the meaning of the term conditional asset retirement obligation as used in FASB 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. We are currently evaluating the impact of FIN 47 on our financial statements. In December 2003, The Securities Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (SAB 104), Revenue Recognition. SAB 104 expands previously issued guidance on the subject of Revenue Recognition and provides specific criteria which must be fulfilled to permit the recognition of revenue from transactions. We do not expect the issuance of SAB 104 to have a material effect on the consolidated results of operations or financial position. In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position (FSP) No. 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP No. 109 2). FSP No. 109 2 provides guidance under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, with respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the Jobs Act) on enterprises income tax expense and deferred tax liability. FSP No. 109 2 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the Jobs Act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for purposes of applying SFAS No. 109. We are currently evaluating the impact of FSP No. 109 2 on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 123R, Share Based Payment, a revision of FASB Statement No. 123. Under this standard, all forms of share based payment to employees, including stock options, would be treated as compensation and recognized in the income statement. This proposed statement would be effective for awards granted, modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We currently account for stock options under APB No. 25. The pro forma impact of expensing options, valued using the Black Scholes valuation model, is disclosed in Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company is currently researching the appropriate valuation model to use for stock options. In connection with the issuance of SFAS 123R, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued Staff Accounting Bulletin number 107 (SAB 107) in March of 2005. SAB 107 provides implementation guidance for companies to use in their adoption of SFAS 123R. We are currently evaluating the effect of SFAS 123R and SAB 107 on our financial statements with the intent of implementing this standard in Fiscal 2007. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 153, Exchanges of Nonmonetary Assets. SFAS 153 is an amendment of Accounting Principles Board Opinion 29, Accounting for Nonmonetary Transactions, and eliminates certain narrow differences between APB 29 and international accounting standards. SFAS 153 is effective for fiscal periods beginning on or after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 153 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. 52 Table of Contents In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 152, Accounting for Real Estate Time Sharing Transactions. SFAS 152 is an amendment of SFAS 66 and 67 and generally requires that real estate time sharing transactions be accounted for as non retail land sales. SFAS 152 is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after June 15, 2005. The adoption of SFAS 152 is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements. In November 2004, the FASB issued SFAS 151, Inventory costs. SFAS 151 is an amendment of Accounting Research Board Opinion number 43 and sets standards for the treatment of abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and spoilage. SFAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2004. We are currently evaluating the impact of SFAS 151 on our financial statements. In October 2004, the FASB Emerging Issue Task Force issued its abstract No. 04 01 (EITF 04 01) Accounting for Pre existing Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination. EITF 04 01 addresses the appropriate accounting treatment for portions of the acquisition costs of an entity which may be deemed to apply to Elements of a pre existing business relationship between the acquiring company and the target company. EITF 04 01 is effective for combinations consummated after October 2004. It is therefore applicable to the pending Footwear acquisition discussed in Note 23. Historically, we had not assigned any value to pre existing business relationships reacquired in purchase transactions. The adoption of EITF 04 01 has no effect on historical financial statements. In January 2003, the FASB issued Financial Interpretation No. (FIN) 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities which was amended by FIN 46R in December, 2003. A variable interest entity is a corporation, partnership, trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either (a) does not have equity investors with voting rights, or (b) has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities. Historically, entities generally were not consolidated unless the entity was controlled through voting interests. FIN 46R changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entitys activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entitys residual returns or both. A company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity. FIN 46R also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46R apply immediately to variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. The consolidation requirements of FIN 46R apply to existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after December 15, 2003. Also, certain disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after January 31, 2003, regardless of when the variable interest entity was established. The adoption of FIN 46R required us to consolidate the assets and liabilities of RL Media. See Notes 2 and 4 to consolidated financial statements regarding Ralph Lauren Media consolidation and our interest in Ralph Lauren Media, LLC. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The market risk inherent in our financial instruments represents the potential loss in fair value, earnings or cash flows arising from adverse changes in interest rates or foreign currency exchange rates. We manage these exposures through operating and financing activities and, when appropriate, through the use of derivative financial instruments. Our policy allows for the use of derivative financial instruments for identifiable market risk exposures, including interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations. During Fiscal 2005, there were significant fluctuations in the value of the Euro to Dollar exchange rate. In June 2002, we entered into a cross currency rate swap to minimize the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations on the long term Euro debt and the impact of fluctuations in the interest rate on the fair value of the long term Euro debt. In May 2003, we terminated the cross currency rate swap, and entered into an interest rate swap, to minimize the impact of changes in the fair value of the Euro debt due to changes in EURIBOR, the benchmark interest rate. The following quantitative disclosures are based on quoted market prices and theoretical pricing models obtained through independent pricing sources for the same or similar types of financial instruments, taking into consideration the underlying terms and maturities. These 53 Table of Contents quantitative disclosures do not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual results may differ from those estimates. Foreign Currency Exchange Rates We are exposed to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. We have assets and liabilities denominated in certain foreign currencies related to international subsidiaries. At April 2, 2005, we had the following foreign exchange contracts outstanding: (i) to deliver 94.3 million in exchange for $124.3 million through Fiscal 2005 and (ii) to deliver 11,389 million in exchange for $99.6 million through Fiscal 2008. We believe that these financial instruments should not subject us to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should offset losses and gains on the assets, liabilities, and transactions being hedged. We are exposed to credit related losses if the counterparty to the financial instruments fails to perform its obligations. However, we do not expect the counterparty, which presently has high credit ratings, to fail to meet its obligations. Our primary foreign currency exposure relates to our Euro debt. As of April 2, 2005, the fair value of our fixed Euro debt was $306.9 million, based on its quoted market price as listed on the London Stock exchange and translated using Euro exchange rates in effect as of April 2, 2005. The potential increase in fair value of our fixed rate Euro debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in exchange rates would have been approximately $30.7 million at April 2, 2005. As of April 2, 2005, a hypothetical immediate 10% adverse change in exchange rates would have had a $6.5 million unfavorable impact over a one year period on our earnings and cash flows. Interest Rates Our primary interest rate exposure relates to our fixed rate debt. The potential decrease in fair value of our fixed rate Euro debt resulting from a hypothetical 10% adverse change in interest rates would have been approximately $4.5 million at April 2, 2005. We employ a fair value hedging strategy utilizing interest rate swaps to effectively float a portion of our interest rate exposure on our fixed rate Euro debt. On April 6, 2004 and October 4, 2004, the company executed interest rate swaps to convert the fixed interest rate on an additional total of Euro 100 million of the Eurobonds to a floating rate. After the execution of this swap, approximately 22 million of Eurobonds remained at fixed interest rate.
