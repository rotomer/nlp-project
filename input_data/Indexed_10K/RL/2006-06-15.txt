Critical accounting policies. This section discusses accounting policies considered to be important to our financial condition and results of operations, and which require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies, are summarized in Notes 3 and 4 to our audited financial statements included elsewhere herein. OVERVIEW Our Company is a leader in the design, marketing and distribution of premium lifestyle products. Our long standing reputation and distinctive image have been consistently developed across an expanding number of products, brands and international markets. Our brand names include Polo, Polo by Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Ralph Lauren Black Label, RLX, Ralph Lauren, Blue Label, Lauren, RL, Rugby, Chaps, and Club Monaco, among others. We classify our interests into three business segments: Wholesale, Retail and Licensing. Through those interests, we design, license, contract for the manufacture of, market and distribute mens, womens and childrens apparel, accessories, fragrances and home furnishings. Our wholesale business consists of wholesale channel sales principally to major department and specialty stores located throughout the United States and Europe. Our retail business consists of retail channel sales directly to consumers through wholly owned, full price and factory retail stores located throughout the United States, Canada, Europe, South America and Asia, and through our jointly 27 owned retail internet site located at www.polo.com. In addition, our licensing business consists of royalty based arrangements under which we license the right to third parties to use our various trademarks in connection with the manufacture and sale of designated products, such as eyewear and fragrances, in specified geographic areas. Our business is affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and key vacation travel and holiday periods in the retail segment. During Fiscal 2006, we reported revenues of $3.746 billion, net income of $308 million and net income per diluted share of $2.87. This compares to revenues of $3.305 billion, net income of $190.4 million and net income per diluted share of $1.83 in Fiscal 2005. Fiscal 2005 operating results include a pretax charge of $100 million associated with a litigation with one of our former licensees, which has now been settled. Recent Developments Acquisition of Polo Jeans Business On February 3, 2006, the Company acquired from Jones Apparel Group, Inc. and subsidiaries (Jones) all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Sun Apparel, Inc., the Companys licensee for mens and womens casual apparel and sportswear in the United States and Canada (the Polo Jeans Business). The acquisition cost was approximately $260 million, including $5 million of transaction costs. The purchase price is subject to certain post closing adjustments. In addition, simultaneous with the transaction, the Company settled all claims under its litigation with Jones for a cost of $100 million (the Jones Related Litigation). The purchase of the Polo Jeans Business will allow the Company to reposition and expand its denim and casual sportswear business. In particular, in May 2006, the Company announced that it will expand its denim and casual sportswear business by introducing new product offerings under the strength of its Lauren brand for women and its Polo brand for men. The Company will continue to distribute Polo Jeans branded products internationally. The results of operations for the Polo Jeans Business have been consolidated in the Companys results of operations commencing February 4, 2006. Acquisition of Footwear Business On July 15, 2005, the Company acquired from Reebok International, Ltd. (Reebok) all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of Ralph Lauren Footwear Co., Inc., the Companys global licensee for mens, womens and childrens footwear, as well as certain foreign assets owned by affiliates of Reebok (collectively, the Footwear Business). The acquisition cost was approximately $112 million in cash, including $2 million of transaction costs. The results of operations for the Footwear Business have been consolidated in the Companys results of operations commencing July 16, 2005. Polo Trademark Litigation Since 1999, the Company has been involved in litigation with the United States Polo Association, Inc., Jordache, Ltd. and certain other entities affiliated with them (collectively, the USPA Group) in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York over alleged infringements of its trademark rights. On October 20, 2005, a jury found that one of the four double horsemen logos that the USPA Group sought to use infringed on the Companys world famous Polo Player Symbol trademark and enjoined its use, but did allow the use of the other three trademarks. In November 2005, the Company filed a motion before the trial court to overturn the jurys decision and hold a new trial with respect to the three marks that the jury found not to be infringing. The USPA and Jordache have opposed this motion, but have not moved to overturn the jurys decision that the fourth double horseman logo did infringe on the Companys trademarks. Pending the judges ruling on this motion, it is the Companys position that, the USPA and Jordache cannot produce or sell products bearing any of the double horseman marks. The Company has preserved its right to appeal if the motion is denied. The Company believes that it is premature to assess the potential impact on its business resulting from the initial adverse ruling. However, the Company believes that the quality of its premium lifestyle products and brands will continue to drive growth in its operating and financial performance notwithstanding the outcome of this matter. 28 Club Monaco Restructuring Plan During Fiscal 2006, the Company recorded approximately $10.8 million of impairment charges to reduce the carrying value of fixed assets, primarily relating to its Club Monaco retail business, including its Caban Concept and Factory Outlet stores. These impairment charges primarily related to lower than expected store performance. During the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006, the Company committed to a plan to restructure the Companys Club Monaco retail business. In particular, this plan consisted of the closure of all five Club Monaco factory outlet stores and the intention to dispose of by sale or closure all eight of Club Monacos Caban Concept stores (collectively, the Club Monaco Restructuring Plan). In connection with this plan, an aggregate restructuring related charge of $12 million was recognized in Fiscal 2006. This charge consisted of (a) a $3 million writedown of inventory to estimated net realizable value, which has been classified as a component of cost of goods sold in the Companys consolidated statement of operations, (b) a $5 million writedown of fixed and other net assets, which has been classified as a component of restructuring charges in the Companys consolidated statement of operations and (c) the recognition of a $4 million liability relating to lease termination costs, which has been classified as a component of restructuring charges in the Companys consolidated statement of operations. The lease termination costs are expected to be paid by the end of 2007. In addition, the Company expects to recognize an additional $2 million restructuring charge during its first quarter of Fiscal 2007 relating to Club Monacos Caban Concept stores. Such costs will be incurred pursuant to the Club Monaco Restructuring Plan, but are not recognizable until Fiscal 2007 in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (US GAAP) because the leased space was still being used at the end of Fiscal 2006. See Note 11 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere herein for further reference. Eyewear Licensing Agreement In February 2006, the Company announced that it had entered into a new, ten year exclusive licensing agreement with Luxottica Group, S.p.A. and affiliates (Luxottica) for the design, production and distribution of prescription frames and sunglasses under the Polo Ralph Lauren brand (the Eyewear Licensing Agreement). Luxottica is a global leader in the premium and luxury eyewear sector, with over 5,000 optical and sun retail stores across the world. The Eyewear Licensing Agreement is effective on January 1, 2007 after the Companys existing licensing agreement with another licensee expires. The Company is entitled to receive annual minimum royalty and design services payments over the life of the contract (the Minimum Guaranteed Payments). Upon the effective date of the contract, the Company will receive a prepayment of approximately $200 million in consideration of the Minimum Guaranteed Payments to be made by Luxottica. The approximate $200 million prepayment is non refundable, except with respect to certain breaches of the agreement by the Company in which case only the unearned portion of the prepayment would be required to be repaid. 29 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 The following table summarizes our results of operations and expresses the percentage relationship to net revenues of our financial statements captions. Fiscal Years Ended April 1, April 2, April 1, April 2, 2006 2005 2006 2005 (millions) Net revenues $ 3,746.3 $ 3,305.4 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold(a) (1,723.9 ) (1,620.9 ) (46.0 ) (49.0 ) Gross profit 2,022.4 1,684.5 54.0 51.0 Selling, general and administrative expenses(a) (1,476.9 ) (1,377.6 ) (39.5 ) (41.7 ) Amortization of intangible assets (9.1 ) (3.4 ) (0.2 ) (0.1 ) Impairments of retail assets (10.8 ) (1.5 ) (0.3 ) Restructuring charges (9.0 ) (2.3 ) (0.2 ) (0.1 ) Operating income 516.6 299.7 13.8 9.1 Foreign currency gains (losses) (5.7 ) 6.1 (0.1 ) 0.2 Interest expense (12.5 ) (11.0 ) (0.3 ) (0.3 ) Interest income 13.7 4.6 0.3 0.1 Equity in income of equity method investees 4.3 6.4 0.1 0.2 Minority interest expense (13.5 ) (8.0 ) (0.4 ) (0.3 ) Income before provision for income taxes 502.9 297.8 13.4 9.0 Provision for income taxes (194.9 ) (107.4 ) (5.2 ) (3.2 ) Net income $ 308.0 $ 190.4 8.2 % 5.8 % Net income per common share Basic $ 2.96 $ 1.88 Net income per common share Diluted $ 2.87 $ 1.83 (a) Includes total depreciation expense of $117.9 million and $98.7 million for Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005, respectively. Net Revenues. Net revenues for Fiscal 2006 were $3,746.3 million, an increase of $440.9 million, compared to net revenues of $3,305.4 million for Fiscal 2005. Wholesale revenues increased by $230.4 million primarily as a result of the sale of newly acquired Footwear and Polo Jeans products, the inclusion of a full year of sales by our childrenswear business, which was acquired in July 2004 (the Childrenswear Business), the successful launch of a Chaps for women and boys product line and, increased sales in our global menswear and womenswear product lines. The increase in net revenues also was caused by a $210.0 million revenue increase in our retail segment as a result of improved comparable retail store sales, continued store expansion and growth in Polo.com sales. Net revenues for our business segments are provided below: Fiscal Years Ended April 1, April 2, Increase 2006 2005 (Decrease) % Change (millions) Net revenues: Wholesale $ 1,942.5 $ 1,712.1 $ 230.4 13.5 % Retail 1,558.6 1,348.6 210.0 15.6 Licensing 245.2 244.7 0.5 0.2 Total net revenues $ 3,746.3 $ 3,305.4 $ 440.9 13.3 % 30 Wholesale net sales the net increase primarily reflects: the inclusion of $58 million of revenue from the newly acquired Footwear Business; the inclusion of $35 million of revenues from the newly acquired Polo Jeans Business; a $74 million increase in revenues from our childrenswear product line that was acquired in July 2004, including the effects from the successful launch of our Chaps for boys product line and a one time benefit of $59 million due to the inclusion of a full year of sales; a $73 million aggregate constant dollar increase in our global menswear and womenswear businesses, primarily driven by strong growth in our Lauren product line and the effects from the successful domestic launch of our Chaps for women product line; and a $14 million decrease in revenues due to an unfavorable foreign currency effect relating to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the Euro during Fiscal 2006. Retail net sales For purposes of the discussion of retail operating performance below, we refer to the measure comparable store sales. Comparable store sales refers to the growth of sales in stores that are open for at least one full fiscal year. Sales for stores that are closing during a fiscal year are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. Sales for stores that are either relocated or enlarged are also excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales until stores have been in their location for at least a full fiscal year. Comparable store sales information includes both Ralph Lauren stores and Club Monaco stores. The increase in retail net sales primarily reflects: an aggregate $74 million increase in comparable full price and outlet store sales. This increase was driven by a 6.5% increase in comparable full price store sales and a 6.3% increase in comparable outlet store sales. Excluding an unfavorable $4 million effect on revenues from foreign currency exchange rates, comparable full price store sales increased 7.0% and comparable outlet store sales increased 6.6%. a net increase in store count of eleven stores, to a total of 289 stores, as several new openings (including our new Rugby store chain) were offset by the closure of certain Club Monaco stores in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006; and a $29 million increase in sales at Polo.com. Licensing revenues Licensing revenues were essentially flat, as increased revenue from our international licensing business, and the domestic launch of the Chaps brand extensions for menswear and accessories offset the decreases in product licensing revenue resulting from our Fiscal 2006 purchase of the Footwear and Polo Jeans Businesses (now included as part of the Wholesale segment). Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold was $1,723.9 million for Fiscal 2006, compared to $1,620.9 million for Fiscal 2005. Expressed as a percentage of net revenues, cost of goods sold was 46.0% for Fiscal 2006, compared to 49.0% for Fiscal 2005. The reduction in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues reflected a continued focus on sourcing efficiencies and reduced markdown activity as a result of better full price sell through of our products. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $2,022.4 million for Fiscal 2006, an increase of $337.9 million or 20% compared to $1,684.5 for Fiscal 2005. This increase reflected higher net sales, improved merchandise margins and sourcing efficiencies generally across our wholesale and retail businesses. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 54.0% in Fiscal 2006 compared to 51.0% in Fiscal 2005. This 300 basis point increase resulted primarily from the factors discussed above and a shift in mix from off price to more full price sales in our wholesale segment. While we expect to continue to realize margin expansion in the future, we expect the rate of expansion will be less in Fiscal 2007. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) were $1,476.9 million for Fiscal 2006, an increase of $99.3 million or 7.2% compared to $1,377.6 million in Fiscal 2005. 31 SG&A expenses in Fiscal 2005 included a $100 million charge in connection with the Jones Related Litigation. On a reported basis, SG&A as a percent of net revenues decreased to 39.5% from 41.7%. However, excluding the effect from the Fiscal 2005 Jones Related Litigation charge, SG&A as a percentage of net revenues increased to 39.5% from 38.7%. Excluding the Fiscal 2005 Jones Related Litigation charge, the $199 million increase in SG&A was primarily driven by: higher payroll related expenses of approximately $89 million principally relating to increased selling costs associated with higher retail sales and our worldwide retail store expansion, higher stock based compensation charges associated with our strong operating performance and increasing stock price, and higher investment in infrastructure to support the ongoing growth of our businesses; higher brand related marketing and facilities costs to support the ongoing growth of our businesses; higher depreciation costs of approximately $19 million in connection with our capital expenditures and global expansion; and the inclusion of SG&A costs for our newly acquired Footwear and Polo Jeans Businesses, as well as the costs for the Childrenswear Business for a full year. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets increased to $9.1 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to $3.4 million in Fiscal 2005. The increase related to higher amortization of intangible assets as part of the Childrenswear Business acquired in July 2004, the Footwear Business acquired in July 2005 and the Polo Jeans Business acquired in February 2006. Impairments of Retail Assets. Non cash impairment charges of $10.8 million were recognized during Fiscal 2006 to reduce the carrying value of fixed assets used in certain of our retail stores, largely relating to our Club Monaco retail business that includes our Caban Concept and Club Monaco Factory Outlet stores. This impairment charge primarily related to lower than expected store performance and preceded the implementation in February 2006 of a plan to restructure these operations. A $1.5 million impairment charge also was recognized in Fiscal 2005 relating to Club Monaco retail stores. Restructuring Charges. Restructuring charges of $9.0 million were recognized in Fiscal 2006, compared to $2.3 million in Fiscal 2005. The Fiscal 2006 restructuring charge relates to the Club Monaco retail business and includes the intended closure of all five Club Monaco outlet stores and the intended disposal of all eight of Club Monacos Caban Concept stores. The Fiscal 2005 restructuring charge principally related to severance obligations incurred in connection with a consolidation of our European operations. We expect to recognize an additional $2 million restructuring charge during the first quarter of Fiscal 2007 relating to Club Monacos Caban Concept stores. Such costs will be incurred pursuant to the Club Monaco Restructuring Plan, but are not recognizable until Fiscal 2007 in accordance with US GAAP because the leased space was still being used at the end of Fiscal 2006. 32 Operating Income. Operating income increased $216.9 million to $516.6 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to $299.7 million in Fiscal 2005. Operating income for Fiscal 2005 was reduced by the $100 million Jones Related Litigation charge. Operating income for our three business segments is provided below: Fiscal Years Ended April 1, April 2, Increase/ 2006 2005 (Decrease) % Change (millions) Operating income: Wholesale $ 398.3 $ 299.7 $ 98.6 32.9 % Retail 140.0 82.8 57.2 69.1 Licensing 153.5 159.5 (6.0 ) (3.8 ) 691.8 542.0 149.8 27.6 Less: Unallocated corporate expense (159.1 ) (133.8 ) (25.3 ) 18.9 Unallocated legal and restructuring charges (16.1 ) (108.5 ) 92.4 (85.2 ) Operating income $ 516.6 $ 299.7 $ 216.9 72.4 % Wholesale operating income increased by $98.6 million primarily as a result of higher sales and improved gross margin rates, partially offset by increases in SG&A expenses and higher amortization expenses associated with intangible assets recognized in acquisitions. Retail operating income increased by $57.2 million primarily as a result of increased net sales and improved gross margin rates. These increases were partially offset by an increase in selling salaries and related costs in connection with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion, along with higher retail store impairment charges. Licensing operating income decreased by $6.0 million primarily due to the loss of royalty income formerly collected in connection with the Footwear, Polo Jeans, and Childrenswear Businesses, which have now been acquired. This decrease was partially offset by improvements in our international licensing business. Unallocated Corporate Expenses increased by $25.3 million primarily as a result of increases in brand related marketing, payroll related and facilities costs to support the ongoing growth of our businesses. Unallocated Legal and Restructuring Charges. Unallocated legal and restructuring charges decreased by $92.4 million in Fiscal 2006. The decrease primarily related to the absence in Fiscal 2006 of the $100 million Jones Related Litigation charge recognized in Fiscal 2005, offset in part by higher restructuring charges of $6.7 million in Fiscal 2006 relating to the Club Monaco Restructuring Plan. Foreign Currency Gains (Losses). The effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss of $5.7 million during Fiscal 2006, compared to a $6.1 million gain during Fiscal 2005. The increased losses in Fiscal 2006 primarily related to unfavorable foreign exchange movements associated with intercompany receivables and payables that were not of a long term investment nature and were settled by our international subsidiaries. These gains and losses are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased to $12.5 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to $11.0 million in Fiscal 2005. This increase was principally related to higher variable rates of interest paid during the year under our interest rate swap agreements that were subsequently terminated. Interest Income. Interest income increased to $13.7 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to $4.6 million in Fiscal 2005. This increase principally related to a higher level of excess cash reinvestment and higher interest rates on our investments during Fiscal 2006. Equity in Income of Equity Method Investees. Equity in the income of equity method investees decreased to $4.3 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to $6.4 million in Fiscal 2005. The decrease principally related to higher amortization in Fiscal 2006 of a basis difference associated with our 20% investment in Impact21, a company that holds the sublicenses for our mens, womens and jeans business in Japan. 33 Minority Interest Expense. Minority interest expense increased to $13.5 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to $8.0 million in Fiscal 2005. The increase principally related to a higher allocation of income to the partners in our jointly owned RL Media venture as a result of its improved operating performance. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased to $194.9 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to $107.4 million in Fiscal 2005. This is a result of an increase in our effective tax rate to 38.8% in Fiscal 2006 from 36.1% in Fiscal 2005 as well as the increase in pretax income. The increase in our effective tax rate principally resulted from the continued growth of our domestic wholesale and retail businesses, which led to a higher state tax impact. Net Income. Net income increased to $308.0 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to $190.4 million in Fiscal 2005. The $117.6 million increase in net income principally related to the $216.9 million increase in operating income previously discussed, including the effect of the $100 million Jones Related Litigation charge recognized in Fiscal 2005. These benefits were offset in part by $11.8 million of higher foreign currency losses and higher taxes of $87.5 million. Net Income Per Share. Net income per diluted share increased to $2.87 in Fiscal 2006, compared to $1.83 in Fiscal 2005. Net income per basic share increased to $2.96 in Fiscal 2006, compared to $1.88 in Fiscal 2005. The improvement in per share results was due to the higher level of net income associated with our underlying operating performance and the absence of the $100 million Jones Related Litigation charge recognized in Fiscal 2005, offset in part by higher dilution associated with higher average shares outstanding. Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 The following table summarizes our historical results of operations and expresses the percentage relationship to net revenues of our financial statement captions. Fiscal Years Ended April 2, April 3, April 2, April 3, 2005 2004 2005 2004 (millions) Net revenues $ 3,305.4 $ 2,649.7 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of goods sold(a) (1,620.9 ) (1,326.4 ) (49.0 ) (50.1 ) Gross profit 1,684.5 1,323.3 51.0 49.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses(a) (1,377.6 ) (1,031.5 ) (41.7 ) (39.0 ) Amortization of intangible assets (3.4 ) (1.3 ) (0.1 ) Impairments of retail assets (1.5 ) Restructuring charges (2.3 ) (19.6 ) (0.1 ) (0.7 ) Operating income 299.7 270.9 9.1 10.2 Foreign currency gains (losses) 6.1 (1.9 ) 0.2 (0.1 ) Interest expense (11.0 ) (12.7 ) (0.3 ) (0.5 ) Interest income 4.6 2.7 0.1 0.1 Equity in income of equity method investees 6.4 5.5 0.2 0.2 Minority interest expense (8.0 ) (1.4 ) (0.3 ) Income before provision for income taxes 297.8 263.1 9.0 9.9 Provision for income taxes (107.4 ) (93.9 ) (3.2 ) (3.5 ) Net income $ 190.4 $ 169.2 5.8 % 6.4 % Net income per common share Basic $ 1.88 $ 1.71 Net income per common share Diluted $ 1.83 $ 1.68 (a) Includes total depreciation expense of $98.7 million and $84.3 million for Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004, respectively. 34 Net Revenues. Net revenues for Fiscal 2005 were $3,305.4 million, an increase of $655.7 million, compared to net revenues of $2,649.7 million for Fiscal 2004. Wholesale revenues increased by $501.7 million primarily as a result of the sale of Lauren and newly acquired Childrenswear products. The increase in net revenues was also caused by a $178.1 million increase in our retail segment as a result of our improved comparable retail store sales, continued store expansion and the favorable impact of the strengthening Euro. These increases were partially offset by decreased sales elsewhere in our wholesale business primarily driven by planned reductions in off price sales in our global menswear and womenswear businesses. In addition, the increase in revenues was offset in part by lower licensing revenues due to the loss of Lauren and Ralph royalties from Jones. Net revenues for our business segments are provided below: Fiscal Years Ended April 2, April 3, Increase 2005 2004 (Decrease) % Change (millions) Net revenues: Wholesale $ 1,712.1 $ 1,210.4 $ 501.7 41.4 % Retail 1,348.6 1,170.5 178.1 15.2 Licensing 244.7 268.8 (24.1 ) (9.0 ) Total net revenues $ 3,305.4 $ 2,649.7 $ 655.7 24.7 % Wholesale net sales the net increase primarily reflects: an incremental increase from the Lauren line of $280.5 million in the current year due to the inclusion of a full years sales versus one quarters sales in the prior year associated with the shift in the Lauren line from a licensed business to a consolidated wholesale business; the inclusion of sales from the newly acquired Childrenswear line of $180.2 million commencing July 2, 2004; a $51.2 million decrease in the domestic mens wholesale business, which resulted from a planned reduction in off price sales and a reduction in spring sales due to a planned reduction of sales to lower margin customers; and increases in the European wholesale business of approximately $37.4 million on a constant dollar basis, as well as a $28.4 million favorable impact due to a stronger Euro in the current period. Retail net sales the increase primarily reflects: an aggregate $48.7 million increase in comparable full price and outlet store sales. This increase was driven by a 5.5% increase in comparable full price store sales and a 3.9% increase in comparable outlet store sales. Excluding a favorable $10.8 million effect on revenues from foreign currency exchange rates and an extra week in Fiscal 2004, comparable full price store sales increased 6.1% and comparable outlet store sales increased 4.9%. the inclusion of $60.6 million of sales as a result of the consolidation of RL Media; worldwide store expansion. During Fiscal 2005, the Company added 30 stores and closed 13 stores. Our total store count at April 2, 2005 was 278 stores, compared to 261 stores at April 3, 2004; and the stronger Euro during Fiscal 2005, which accounted for approximately $14.7 million of the increase in net sales. Licensing revenue the net decrease primarily reflects: the elimination of $34.6 million of royalties from our domestic licensing business due to the acquisition of the Childrenswear Business and a full year without royalties from the Lauren licensee; and a $13 million increase in international licensing. 35 Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold was $1,620.9 million for Fiscal 2005, compared to $1,326.4 million for Fiscal 2004. Expressed as a percentage of net revenues, cost of goods sold was 49.0% for Fiscal 2005, compared to 50.1% for Fiscal 2004. The reduction in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues reflected our inventory management initiatives and reduced markdown activity. Gross Profit. Gross profit was $1,684.5 million for Fiscal 2005, an increase of $361.2 million or 27.3% compared to $1,323.3 million for Fiscal 2004. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased to 51.0% from 49.9% primarily as a result of improved margins in our wholesale and retail businesses driven by reduced markdowns and our inventory management initiatives. Partially offsetting these improvements is the loss of licensing revenues from the Lauren and Childrenswear lines. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SG&A increased $346.1 million, or 33.6%, to $1,377.6 million during Fiscal 2005 from $1,031.5 million in Fiscal 2004. SG&A as a percent of net revenues increased to 41.7% from 39.0%. The increase in SG&A was primarily driven by: legal charges of $100 million recorded in connection with Jones Related Litigation and a charge of $6 million recorded in connection with a credit card matter. higher selling salaries and related costs of $85 million, on a constant dollar basis, in connection with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion. approximately $20 million of the increase in SG&A was due to the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily as a result of the strengthening of the Euro during Fiscal 2005. expenses of $30 million as a result of the consolidation of Ralph Lauren Media. incremental expenses of $22 million associated with a full years activity in the Lauren wholesale business, exclusive of additional corporate and overhead expenses incurred and reduced royalty revenues received. expenses of $38 million associated with the newly acquired Childrenswear Business. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets increased to $3.4 million during Fiscal 2005, compared to $1.3 million during Fiscal 2005. The increase resulted from amortization of intangible assets as part of the Childrenswear Business acquired in July 2004. Impairments of Retail Assets. A non cash impairment charge of $1.5 million was recognized during Fiscal 2005 to reduce the carrying value of fixed assets used in certain of our retail stores, largely relating to our Club Monaco brand. The impairment charge primarily related to lower than expected store performance. Restructuring Charges. We recorded restructuring charges of $2.3 million during Fiscal 2005, compared to restructuring charges of $19.6 million during Fiscal 2004. The Fiscal 2005 restructuring charge is primarily comprised of additional contract termination and severance costs related to the consolidation of our European business operations. The Fiscal 2004 restructuring charges related to a restructuring of our European operations, a restructuring of our retail operations and the closing of certain RRL retail stores. 36 Operating Income. Operating income increased $28.8 million, or 10.6%, to $299.7 million in Fiscal 2005, compared to $270.9 million in Fiscal 2004. Operating income for Fiscal 2005 was reduced by the $100 million Jones Related Litigation charge and a $6 million legal charge in connection with a credit card matter. Operating income for our three business segments is provided below: Fiscal Years Ended April 2, April 3, Increase 2005 2004 (Decrease) % Change (millions) Operating income: Wholesale $ 299.7 $ 143.1 $ 156.6 109.4 % Retail 82.8 55.7 27.1 48.7 Licensing 159.5 191.6 (32.1 ) (16.8 ) 542.0 390.4 151.6 38.8 Less: Unallocated Corporate expense (133.8 ) (99.9 ) (33.9 ) (33.9 ) Unallocated legal and restructuring charges (108.5 ) (19.6 ) (88.9 ) NM Operating income $ 299.7 $ 270.9 28.8 10.6 % Wholesale operating income increased primarily as a result of incremental net sales in our newly acquired Childrenswear Business and a full year of activity in the Lauren business. Retail operating income increased primarily as a result of increased net sales and improved gross profits as a percentage of net revenues. These increases were partially offset by the increase in selling salaries and related costs in connection with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion. Licensing income decreased primarily due to the loss of the Lauren and Childrenswear royalties. This decrease was partially offset by improvements in our international licensing business. Unallocated Corporate Expenses increased primarily as a result of increased stock compensation expense and increased bonus accruals resulting from our increased operating performance. Unallocated Legal and Restructuring Charges. Unallocated legal and restructuring charges increased by $88.9 million in Fiscal 2005. The increase primarily related to the $100 million Jones Related Litigation charge and $6 million credit card charge recognized in Fiscal 2005, offset in part by lower restructuring charges of $17.3 million in Fiscal 2005. Foreign Currency (Gains) Losses. The effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a gain of $6.1 million during Fiscal 2005, compared to a $1.9 million loss during Fiscal 2004. These gains are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased to $11.0 million in Fiscal 2005, compared to $12.7 million for Fiscal 2004. This decrease was due to the repayment of approximately $101 million of short term borrowings during Fiscal 2004, as well as lower interest rates. Interest Income. Interest income increased to $4.6 million in Fiscal 2005, compared to $2.7 million in Fiscal 2004 primarily due to higher average balances of invested cash. Equity in income of equity method investees. Equity in the income of equity method investees increased to $6.4 million in Fiscal 2005, compared to $5.5 million in Fiscal 2004. The increase principally related to the improved operating performance of our 20% investment in Impact21, a company that holds the sublicenses for our mens, womens and jeans business in Japan. Minority interest expense. Minority interest expense increased to $8.0 million in Fiscal 2005, compared to $1.4 million in Fiscal 2004. The increase principally related to the allocation of income to the partners in our jointly owned RL Media venture, which was consolidated effective as of the end of Fiscal 2004. 37 Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased to $107.4 million in Fiscal 2005, compared to $93.9 million in Fiscal 2004. This increase related to an increase in our effective tax rate to 36.1% in Fiscal 2005 from 35.7% in Fiscal 2004. The increase in our effective tax rate principally resulted from the continued growth of our domestic wholesale and retail businesses, which led to a higher state tax impact. Net Income. Net income increased to $190.4 million in Fiscal 2005, compared to $169.2 million in Fiscal 2004. The $21.2 million increase in net income principally related to the increase in operating income previously discussed, which was reduced by approximately $106 million of litigation related charges. Net Income Per Share. Net income per diluted share increased to $1.83 in Fiscal 2005, compared to $1.68 in Fiscal 2004. Net income per basic share increased to $1.88 in Fiscal 2005, compared to $1.71 in Fiscal 2004. The improvement in per share results was due to the higher level of net income associated with our underlying operating performance, offset in part by higher dilution associated with higher average shares outstanding. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Financial Condition At April 1, 2006, the Company had $285.7 million of cash and cash equivalents, $280.4 million of debt (net cash of $5.3 million, defined as total cash and cash equivalents less total debt) and $2,049.6 million of stockholders equity. This compares to $350.5 million of cash and cash equivalents, $291.0 million of debt (net cash of $59.5 million) and $1,675.7 million of stockholders equity at April 2, 2005. The decrease in our net cash position principally related to the use of approximately $159 million in cash to fund capital expenditures and approximately $480 million of cash primarily to fund the Polo Jeans and Footwear transactions. These funding requirements more than offset the strong growth in the Companys operating cash flow. The increase in stockholders equity principally related to the Companys strong earnings growth in Fiscal 2006. Cash Flows Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to approximately $449 million during Fiscal 2006, compared to $382 million in Fiscal 2005. This $67 million increase in cash flow was driven primarily by an increase in net income and lower working capital requirements, offset, in part, by a $100 million payment to settle the Jones Related Litigation. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $539 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to approximately $417 million in Fiscal 2005. The increase in cash used in investing activities principally related to acquisition related activities. In Fiscal 2006, the Company used approximately $380 million primarily to fund the acquisition of the Polo Jeans Business and Footwear Business, whereas in Fiscal 2005, the Company used approximately $243 million principally to fund the acquisition of the Childrenswear Business. In addition, net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures of $159 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to $174 million in Fiscal 2005. Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $34 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to approximately $32 million in Fiscal 2005. The $2 million increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily related to the settlement of an interest rate swap agreement and an increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by the cost associated with repurchases of common stock. The Company repurchased common stock under its common stock repurchase program at an aggregate cost of approximately $4 million in Fiscal 2006. The Company did not repurchase common stock under its common stock repurchase program in Fiscal 2005. Proceeds received from the exercise of stock options were $55 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to $53 million in Fiscal 2005. Cash dividends paid were $21 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to $22 million in Fiscal 2005. 38 Fiscal 2005 Compared to Fiscal 2004 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $382 million during Fiscal 2005, compared to approximately $214 million in Fiscal 2004. This $168 million increase in cash flow was driven by an increase in net income before the $100 million non cash, Jones Related Litigation charge and $102 million of non cash, depreciation and amortization expense, offset in part by higher working capital requirements. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was approximately $417 million in Fiscal 2005, compared to approximately $135 million in Fiscal 2004. The increase of cash used in investing activities principally related to acquisition related spending of $243 million in Fiscal 2005, which was substantially utilized in connection with the purchase of the Childrenswear Business. In addition, capital expenditures increased to $174 million in Fiscal 2005, compared to $126 million in Fiscal 2004. Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was approximately $32 million in Fiscal 2005, compared to approximately $76 million of cash used in Fiscal 2004. Cash provided by financing activities during Fiscal 2005, consisted of the payment of $22 million in dividends, offset by proceeds of $53 million from the exercise of stock options. Cash used by financing activities during Fiscal 2004 primarily consisted of the net repayment of short term borrowings of approximately $101 million and the payment of $15 million in dividends, partially offset by $39 million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options. Liquidity The Companys primary sources of liquidity are the cash flow generated from its operations, which includes the approximate $200 million to be received in January 2007 under its new Eyewear Licensing Agreement, $450 million of availability under its credit facility, available cash and equivalents and other potential sources of financial capacity relating to its under leveraged capital structure. These sources of liquidity are needed to fund the Companys ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, retail store expansion, construction and renovation of shop within shops, investment in technological infrastructure, acquisitions, dividends, debt repayment, stock repurchases and other corporate activities. Management believes that the Companys existing resources of cash will be sufficient to support its operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. As discussed below under the section entitled Debt and Covenant Compliance, the Company had no borrowings under its credit facility as of April 1, 2006. However, in the event of a material acquisition, settlement of a material contingency or a material adverse business development, the Company may need to draw on its credit facility or other potential sources of financing. Also, as discussed below, the Company currently intends to refinance its Euro debt obligations that mature in November 2006 during the first half of Fiscal 2007, subject to prevailing market conditions and its ability to refinance such debt obligations on acceptable terms. Common Stock Repurchase Program The Company currently has a common stock repurchase program that allows it to repurchase, from time to time, up to $100 million of Class A common stock. Share repurchases are subject to overall business and market conditions. The Company also had a pre existing common stock repurchase program that expired at the end of Fiscal 2006. Under that pre existing program, the Company repurchased 69.3 thousand shares of Class A common stock in Fiscal 2006 at a cost of approximately $4 million. No shares of Class A common stock were repurchased in Fiscal 2005 and Fiscal 2004. Dividends The Company intends to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends on its outstanding common stock. However, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, the Companys results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. 39 The Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per outstanding share in each quarter of Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005. The aggregate amount of dividend payments was $21 million in Fiscal 2006, $22 million in Fiscal 2005 and $15 million in Fiscal 2004. Debt and Covenant Compliance Euro Debt The Company has outstanding approximately 227 million principal amount of 6.125% notes that are due in November 2006 (the Euro Debt). The carrying value of the Euro Debt changes as a result of changes in Euro exchange rates and changes in its fair value associated with an interest rate swap agreement that had been used until its termination in March 2006 as an effective hedge against changes in the fair value of the Euro Debt. As of April 2, 2006, the carrying value of the Euro Debt was $280.4 million, compared to $291.0 million at April 2, 2005. The Company has the option to redeem the Euro Debt at any time prior to its scheduled maturity. The Company currently intends to refinance the Euro Debt during the first half of Fiscal 2007, subject to prevailing market conditions and its ability to refinance such debt obligations on acceptable terms. Revolving Credit Facility The Company has a credit facility (the Credit Facility) that currently provides for a $450 million revolving line of credit, which can be increased to up to $525 million if one or more new or existing lenders under the facility agree to increase their commitments. The credit facility also is used to support the issuance of letters of credit. As of April 1, 2006, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility, but the Company was contingently liable for $46 million of outstanding letters of credit (primarily relating to inventory purchase commitments). The Credit Facility expires on October 6, 2009. There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing availability throughout its term. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin plus, at the Companys option, either (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (i) the prime commercial lending rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank in effect from time to time and (ii) the weighted average overnight Federal funds rate (as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) plus 50 basis points or (b) a LIBOR rate in effect from time to time, as adjusted for the Federal Reserve Boards Euro currency liabilities maximum reserve percentage. The applicable margin was 62.5 basis points as of the end of Fiscal 2006 and is subject to adjustment based on the Companys credit ratings at the time of any borrowings. In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate was 15 basis points as of the end of Fiscal 2006, and is subject to adjustment based on the Companys credit ratings. The Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Companys ability, subject to specified exemptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens and contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets, including equity interests; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not in a related line of business; make loans, advances or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make investments. In addition, the Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain certain financial covenants, consisting of (i) a minimum ratio of Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization and Rent (EBITDAR) to the sum of Consolidated Interest Expense and Consolidated Lease Expense and (ii) a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to EBITDAR, as such terms are defined in the Credit Facility. As of April 1, 2006, the Company was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an event of default under the Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The Credit Facility specifies a number of events of default (many of which are subject to applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure to make timely principal and interest payments or to satisfy the covenants, including the financial covenants described above. Additionally, the Credit Facility provides that an event of default will occur if 40 Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and related entities fail to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power of the Companys common stock. Contractual and Other Obligations Firm Commitments The following table summarizes certain of the Companys aggregate contractual obligations at April 1, 2006, and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on the Companys liquidity and cash flow in future periods. The Company expects to fund the firm commitments with operating cash flow generated in the normal course of business and, if necessary, availability under its $450 million credit facility or other potential sources of financing.

Amounts do not include any fair value adjustments, call premiums or interest payments. Inventory Purchase Commitments represents the Companys legally binding agreements to purchase fixed or minimum quantities of goods at determinable prices Lease Obligations represents the minimum lease rental payments under noncancelable leases for the Companys real estate and operating equipment in various locations around the world. A significant portion of these lease obligations relate to the Companys retail operations. Information has been presented separately for operating and capital leases. In addition to such amounts, the Company is normally required to pay taxes, insurance and occupancy costs relating to its leased real estate properties. Refer to Note 15 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere herein for a description of the Companys contingent commitments, primarily letters of credit, not included in the above table. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT The Company has exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to both the cash flows generated by its international operations and the fair value of its international operations, as well as exposure to changes in the fair value of its fixed rate debt relating to changes in interest rates. Consequently, the Company uses derivative financial instruments to manage such risks. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. The following is a summary of the Companys risk management strategies and the effect of those strategies on the Companys financial statements. Foreign Currency Risk Management Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts as hedges relating to identifiable currency positions to reduce its risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases and intercompany royalty payments. As part of its overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily exposure to changes in the value of the Euro and Yen, the Company hedges a portion of its 41 foreign currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing twelve month to two year period. In doing so, the Company uses foreign exchange contracts that generally have maturities of three months to two years to provide continuing coverage throughout the hedging period. At April 1, 2006, the Company had contracts for the sale of $90 million of foreign currencies at fixed rates. Of these $90 million of sales contracts, $22 million were for the sale of Euros and $68 million were for the sale of Japanese Yen. The fair value of the forward contracts was an unrealized loss of $2 million. At April 2, 2005, the Company had contracts for the sale of $224 million of foreign currencies at fixed rates. Of these $224 million of sales contracts, $124 million were for the sale of Euros and $100 million were for the sale of Japanese Yen. The fair value of the forward contracts was an unrealized loss of $7 million. The Company records foreign currency exchange contracts at fair value in its balance sheets and designated these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges in accordance with FASB Statement No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and subsequent amendments (FAS 133). As such, the related gains or losses on these contracts are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. These deferred gains and losses are then either recognized in income in the period in which the related royalties being hedged are received, or in the case of inventory purchases, recognized as part of the cost of the inventory being hedged when sold. However, to the extent that any of these foreign currency exchange contracts are not considered to be 100% effective in offsetting the change in the value of the royalties or inventory purchases being hedged, any changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts is immediately recognized in income. No significant gains or losses relating to ineffective hedges were recognized in any period. The Company had deferred net losses on foreign currency exchange contracts in the amount of approximately $1 million at the end of Fiscal 2006, less than half of which is expected to be recognized in earnings in Fiscal 2007. Net losses on foreign currency exchange contracts in the amount of approximately $6 million were deferred at the end of Fiscal 2005. The Company recognized net losses on foreign currency exchange contracts in earnings of $5 million for Fiscal 2006 and $11 million for Fiscal 2005. Based on the foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding at April 1, 2006, a 10% devaluation of the U.S. dollar as compared to the level of foreign currency exchange rates for currencies under contract at April 1, 2006 would result in approximately $9 million of net unrealized losses. Conversely, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar would result in approximately $9 million of net unrealized gains. Because the foreign currency exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions, the unrealized loss or gain as a result of a 10% devaluation or appreciation would be largely offset by changes in the underlying hedged items. Hedge of a Net Investment in Certain European Subsidiaries The Company has outstanding approximately 227.0 million principal amount of Euro Debt. The entire principal amount of the Euro Debt has been designated as a fair value hedge of the Companys net investment in certain of its European subsidiaries in accordance with FAS 133. As required by FAS 133, the changes in fair value of a derivative instrument that is designated as, and is effective as, an economic hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation are reported in the same manner as a translation adjustment under FASB Statement No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, to the extent it is effective as a hedge. As such, changes in the fair value of the Euro Debt resulting from changes in the Euro exchange rate are reported in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company recorded gains (losses) in stockholders equity on the translation of the Euro Debt to U.S. dollars in the amount of approximately $4 million for Fiscal 2006, $(18) million for Fiscal 2005 and $(31) million for Fiscal 2004. Interest Rate Risk Management Historically, the Company has used floating rate interest rate swap agreements to hedge changes in the fair value of its fixed rate Euro Debt. These interest rate swap agreements, which effectively converted fixed interest rate payments on the Companys Euro Debt to a floating rate basis, were designated as a fair value hedge in accordance with FAS 133. The Company had interest rate swap agreements on the amount of approximately 42 205 million notional amount of indebtness as of the end of Fiscal 2005, but all of such swap agreements were terminated in March 2006. No other interest rate swap agreements were held as of the end of Fiscal 2006. As a fair value hedge, the Company records interest rate swap agreements at fair value in its balance sheet. Changes in fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are offset in earnings against changes in the fair value of the underlying portion of the Euro Debt being hedged. In accordance with FAS 133, the Company has assumed no hedge ineffectiveness as the terms of the interest rate swaps mirrored the terms of the Euro debt. In connection with the termination of these interest rate swap agreements in Fiscal 2006, the Company received a net settlement of approximately $5 million. Such amount has been reflected as an increase in the carrying value of the Euro Debt and will be recognized as an adjustment to interest expense (similar to the accounting for a debt premium) over the remaining maturity of the Euro Debt. At April 1, 2006, the Company had no variable rate debt outstanding. As such, the Companys exposure to changes in interest rates primarily related to its fixed rate Euro Debt. At April 1, 2006, the carrying value of the Euro Debt was $280.4 million and the fair value was $279.9 million. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of the Euro Debt by approximately $0.4 million. Such potential increases or decreases are based on certain simplifying assumptions, including no changes in euro currency exchange rates and an immediate across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The SECs Financial Reporting Release No. 60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies (FRR 60), suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the Companys financial condition and results, and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. The Company believes that the following list represents its critical accounting policies as contemplated by FRR 60. For a summary of all of the Companys significant accounting policies, see Notes 3 and 4 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere herein. Sales Allowances and Uncollectible Accounts A significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and net income is estimating the portion of revenues and related receivables that are not realizable. In particular, wholesale revenue is reduced by estimates of returns, discounts, end of season markdown allowances and operational chargebacks. Retail revenue, including e commerce sales, also is reduced by estimates of returns. In determining estimates of returns, discounts, end of season markdown allowances and operational chargebacks, management analyzes historical trends, seasonal results, current economic and market conditions and retailer performance. The Company reviews and refines these estimates on a quarterly basis. The Companys historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. Similarly, management evaluates accounts receivables to determine if they will ultimately be collected. In performing this evaluation, significant judgments and estimates are included, including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for larger accounts and customers, and a receivables aging analysis that determines the percentage of receivables that has historically been uncollected by aged category. Based on this information, management provides a reserve for the estimated amounts believed to be uncollectible. See Accounts Receivable under Note 3 to the audited financial statements included elsewhere herein for an analysis of the activity in the Companys reserves for sales allowances and uncollectible accounts for each of the three fiscal years ended April 1, 2006. Inventories The Company holds inventory that is sold through wholesale distribution channels to major department stores and specialty retail stores, including its own retail stores. The Company also holds retail inventory that is sold in its 43 own stores directly to consumers. Wholesale and retail inventories are stated at lower of cost or estimated realizable value. Cost for wholesale inventories is determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method and cost for retail inventories is determined on a moving average cost basis. The Company continually evaluates the composition of its inventories assessing slow turning, ongoing product, as well as all fashion product. Estimated realizable value of distressed inventory is determined based on historical sales trends for this category of inventory of the Companys individual product lines, the impact of market trends and economic conditions, and the value of current orders in house relating to the future sales of this type of inventory. Estimates may differ from actual results due to quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions. The Companys historical estimates of these costs and its provisions have not differed materially from actual results. Income Taxes Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method prescribed by FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FAS 109). Under this method, income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets, deferred tax liabilities, taxes currently payable/ refunds receivable and tax expense) are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP and tax reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of any net operating loss, capital loss and general business credit carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. The financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates is accounted for in the period of enactment. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. That is, in the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. It is the Companys policy to establish reserves for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities. The Company establishes those reserves based upon managements assessment of the exposure associated with permanent tax differences and tax credits. In addition, valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax reserves and valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments to those balances. Purchase Accounting The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. As such, the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. In addition, in connection with its recent business acquisitions, the Company has settled certain pre existing relationships. These pre existing relationships include licensing agreements and litigation in the case of the acquisition of the Polo Jeans Business. In accordance with EITF 04 1, Accounting for Pre existing Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination, the Company is required to allocate the aggregate consideration exchanged in these transactions between the value of the business acquired and the value of the settlement of the pre existing relationship in proportion to estimates of their respective fair values. If the terms of the pre existing relationship were determined to not be reflective of market, a settlement gain or loss would be recognized in earnings. Accordingly, significant judgment is required to determine the respective fair values of the business acquired and the value of the settlement of the pre existing relationship. The Company has historically utilized independent valuation firms to assist in the determination of fair value. Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of FASB Statement No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, (FAS 142). Under FAS 142, goodwill, including any goodwill 44 included in the carrying value of investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually based on comparisons of their respective fair values to their carrying values. Finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective useful lives and, along with other long lived assets are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable in accordance with FASB Statement No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (FAS 144). In accordance with FAS 142, goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is used to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge. To assist in the process of determining goodwill impairment, the Company obtains appraisals from independent valuation firms. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons and recent transactions. These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting the risks inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables. The impairment test for other indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. In addition, in evaluating finite lived intangible assets for recoverability, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition in accordance with FAS 144. To the extent the estimated future, undiscounted cash inflows attributable to the asset, less estimated future, undiscounted cash outflows, are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value. There have been no impairment losses recorded in connection with the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets during any of the three fiscal years ended April 1, 2006. Impairment of Other Long Lived Assets In accordance with FAS 144, the recoverability of the carrying values of other long lived assets, such as property and equipment, is evaluated whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that such values may be impaired. In evaluating a long lived asset for recoverability, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. To the extent that estimated future, undiscounted cash inflows attributable to the asset, less estimated future, undiscounted cash outflows, are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference between the carrying 45 value of such asset and its fair value. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal, whether through sale or abandonment, are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. In determining future cash flows, the Company takes various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the impact of more experienced retail store managers, the impact of increased local advertising and the emphasis on retail store cost controls. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations. The Company recognized impairment charges on retail fixed assets in the amounts of approximately $11 million for Fiscal 2006 and $2 million for Fiscal 2005. No impairment charges were recognized in Fiscal 2004. Item 7A.
