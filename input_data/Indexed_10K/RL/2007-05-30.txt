Recently issued accounting standards. This section discusses the potential impact to our reported financial condition and results of operations of accounting standards that have been issued, but which we have not yet adopted. OVERVIEW Our Business Our Company is a global leader in the design, marketing and distribution of premium lifestyle products including mens, womens and childrens apparel, accessories, fragrances and home furnishings. Our long standing reputation and distinctive image have been consistently developed across an expanding number of products, brands and international markets. Our brand names include Polo, Polo by Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Ralph Lauren Black Label, RLX, Ralph Lauren Blue Label, Lauren, RRL, Rugby, Chaps, Club Monaco and American Living, among others. We classify our businesses into three segments: Wholesale, Retail and Licensing. Our wholesale business (representing 54% of Fiscal 2007 net revenues) consists of wholesale channel sales made principally to major department stores, specialty stores and golf and pro shops located throughout the U.S. and Europe. Our retail business (representing 41% of Fiscal 2007 net revenues) consists of retail channel sales directly to consumers through full price and factory retail stores located throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, South America and Asia, and through our retail internet site located at www.Polo.com. In addition, our licensing business (representing 5% of 30 Fiscal 2007 net revenues) consists of royalty based arrangements under which we license the right to third parties to use our various trademarks in connection with the manufacture and sale of designated products, such as apparel, eyewear and fragrances, in specified geographical areas for specified periods. Approximately 20% of our Fiscal 2007 net revenues was earned in the international regions outside of the U.S. and Canada. See Note 20 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of net revenues by geographic location. Our business is affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and key vacation travel, back to school and holiday periods in the Retail segment. Our Objectives and Risks We believe our core strengths, including a global luxury lifestyle brand, a strong and experienced management team, a proven ability to develop and extend our brands distributed through multiple retail channels in global markets, a disciplined investment philosophy and a solid balance sheet, have collectively enabled us to significantly increase stockholder value in recent years. Further, we believe those core strengths will continue to allow us to execute our strategy for long term sustainable growth in revenue, net income and operating cash flow. Our operating success has been driven by the Companys focus on six key objectives: Creating unique businesses primarily centered around one core and heritage driven brand; Diversifying and expanding our products and prices, distribution channels and geographic regions; Improving brand control and positioning; Focusing on selective strategic partnerships; Implementing infrastructure improvements that support a worldwide business; and Funding our expansion through strong operating cash flow. In connection with these objectives, we intend to continue to pursue opportunities for growth globally to expand our retail presence in various formats designed to meet consumer needs, to further develop a wide array of luxury accessories product offerings, and to create new lifestyle brands in partnership with select department and specialty stores. Significant challenges and risks accompany our opportunities for long term growth and our ability to increase stockholder value. See Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Fiscal 2007 10 K for further discussion. Summary of Financial Performance Operating Results During Fiscal 2007, we reported revenues of $4.295 billion, net income of $400.9 million and net income per diluted share of $3.73. This compares to revenues of $3.746 billion, net income of $308.0 million and net income per diluted share of $2.87 during Fiscal 2006. Our strong Fiscal 2007 operating performance was primarily driven by 14.7% revenue growth led by our Wholesale and Retail segments (including the effect of certain acquisitions that occurred in Fiscal 2006) and gross profit percentage expansion of 40 basis points to 54.4%. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, revenues increased by 10.0%. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased 140 basis points to 15.2% during Fiscal 2007, reflecting our revenue growth, gross profit percentage expansion and improved leveraging of selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses. SGA expenses included stock based compensation costs reflecting the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payment (FAS 123R). Such costs were $43.6 million on a pre tax basis ($26.1 million after tax) in Fiscal 2007, compared to $26.6 million on a pre tax basis ($16.2 million after tax) in Fiscal 2006. In turn, net income per diluted share was reduced by stock based compensation costs in the amount of $0.24 per share during Fiscal 2007, compared to $0.15 per share during Fiscal 2006. Offsetting the higher stock based compensation costs and contributing to the growth in net income and net income per diluted share was a net reduction in Fiscal 2007 of $19.0 million of pre tax charges related to restructurings, asset impairments and credit card contingencies as compared to Fiscal 2006. See Transactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition described below for further discussion of these transactions. 31 See Note 18 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the impact of adopting FAS 123R. Financial Condition and Liquidity Our financial position continues to reflect the strength of our business results. We ended Fiscal 2007 with a net cash position (total cash and cash equivalents less total debt) of $165.1 million, compared to $5.3 million at the end of Fiscal 2006. In addition, our stockholders equity increased to $2.335 billion as of March 31, 2007, compared to $2.050 billion as of April 1, 2006. During Fiscal 2007, we successfully completed the issuance of 300 million principal amount of 4.50% notes due October 4, 2013 (the 2006 Euro Debt). We used the net proceeds from this issuance to repay approximately 227 million principal amount of Euro debt obligations that matured on November 22, 2006 (the 1999 Euro Debt) and for general corporate and working capital purposes. Also, during Fiscal 2007, we took advantage of our recent credit rating upgrades and amended our credit facility to increase our borrowing capacity, lower our financing costs and eliminate certain financial covenants (see Note 13 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion). We generated $796.1 million of cash from operations during Fiscal 2007, compared to $449.1 million in the prior fiscal year. Included in our cash from operations was approximately $180 million (net of certain refundable tax withholdings) of prepaid royalty and design service fees from Luxottica Group, S.p.A. and affiliates (Luxottica) in connection with the start of our ten year eyewear licensing agreement with Luxottica (see Note 22 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion). We used our higher cash availability to reinvest in our business through capital spending and acquisitions, as well as in connection with the expansion of our common stock repurchase program. In particular, we had $184 million of capital expenditures primarily associated with retail store expansion, construction and renovation of shop in shops in department stores and investments in our technological infrastructure. We used $175 million to acquire the remaining 50% equity interest in RL Media, our e commerce subsidiary, that we did not previously own (see Recent Developments for further discussion). We also acquired 3.5 million shares of Class A common stock at an aggregate cost of $231.3 million. Transactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition The comparability of our operating results has been affected by certain acquisitions that occurred in Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005. In particular, we acquired the Polo Jeans Business on February 3, 2006, the Footwear Business on July 15, 2005, and the Childrenswear Business on July 2, 2004 (each as defined in Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements). In addition, as noted above, the comparability of our operating results also has been affected by the change in accounting for stock based compensation effective as of the beginning of Fiscal 2007, and by certain pre tax charges related to restructurings, asset impairments, and credit card and other litigation related contingencies during the fiscal years presented. A summary of the effect of these items on pre tax income for each period presented is noted below: Fiscal Years Ended March 31, April 1, April 2, 2007 2006 2005 (millions) Stock based compensation costs (see Note 18) $ (43.6 ) $ (26.6 ) $ (12.9 ) Restructuring charges (see Note 11) (4.6 ) (9.0 ) (2.3 ) Impairments of retail assets (see Note 7) (10.8 ) (1.5 ) Credit card contingency charge (see Note 15) (3.0 ) (6.8 ) (6.2 ) Jones related litigation charge (see Note 5) (100.0 ) $ (51.2 ) $ (53.2 ) $ (122.9 ) The following discussion of results of operations highlights, as necessary, the significant changes in operating results arising from these items and transactions. However, unusual items or transactions may occur in any period. Accordingly, investors and other financial statement users individually should consider the types of events and transactions that have affected operating trends. 32 Recent Developments Japanese Business Acquisitions On May 29, 2007, the Company completed its previously announced transactions to acquire control of certain of its Japanese businesses that were formerly conducted under licensed arrangements. In particular, the Company acquired approximately 77% of the outstanding shares of Impact 21 that it did not previously own in a cash tender offer (the Impact 21 Acquisition), thereby increasing its ownership in Impact 21 from approximately 20% to 97%. Impact 21 conducts the Companys mens, womens and jeans apparel and accessories business in Japan under a sub license arrangement. In addition, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in Polo Ralph Lauren Japan Corporation (PRL Japan), which holds the master license to conduct Polos business in Japan, from Onward Kashiyama Co. Ltd and its subsidiaries (Onward Kashiyama) and The Seibu Department Stores, Ltd (the PRL Japan Minority Interest Acquisition). Collectively, the Impact 21 Acquisition and the PRL Japan Minority Interest Acquisition are hereafter referred to as the Japanese Business Acquisitions. The purchase price initially paid in connection with the Impact 21 Acquisition was approximately $327 million. However, the Company intends to acquire, over the next several months, the remaining approximately 3% of the outstanding shares not exchanged as of the close of the tender offer period at an estimated aggregate cost of approximately $12 million. In addition, the purchase price paid in connection with the PRL Japan Minority Interest Acquisition was approximately $22 million. The Company funded the Japanese Business Acquisitions with available cash on hand and approximately $170 million of Yen based borrowings under a one year term loan agreement on terms substantially similar to the Companys existing credit facility. The Company expects to repay the borrowing by its maturity date using a portion of the approximate $200 million of Impact 21s cash on hand acquired as part of the acquisition. The results of operations for Impact 21 will be consolidated effective as of the beginning of Fiscal 2008. The results of operations for PRL Japan already are consolidated by the Company as described further in Note 2 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements. The Company is in the process of preparing its assessment of the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for the allocation of the purchase price. The Company also has entered into a transition services agreement with Onward Kashiyama which, along with its affiliates, was a former approximate 41% shareholder of Impact 21, to provide a variety of operational, human resources and information systems related services over a period of up to two years. The Company does not expect the results of the Japanese Business Acquisitions to contribute to its profitability until Fiscal 2009 primarily due to the dilutive effect of the anticipated non cash costs to be recognized in connection with the allocation of a portion of the purchase price to inventory and certain intangible assets. Acquisition of Small Leathergoods Business On April 13, 2007, the Company acquired from Kellwood Company (Kellwood) substantially all of the assets of New Campaign, Inc., the Companys licensee for mens and womens belts and other small leather goods under the Ralph Lauren, Lauren and Chaps brands in the U.S. The assets acquired from Kellwood will be operated under the name of Polo Ralph Lauren Leathergoods and will allow the Company to further expand its accessories business. The acquisition cost was approximately $10 million and is subject to customary closing adjustments. Kellwood will provide various transition services for up to six months after the closing. The results of operations for the Polo Ralph Lauren Leathergoods business will be consolidated in the Companys results of operations commencing in Fiscal 2008. Acquisition of RL Media Minority Interest On March 28, 2007, the Company acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in Ralph Lauren Media, LLC (RL Media) held by NBC Universal, Inc. and its related entities (37.5%) and Value Vision International, Inc. and its related entities (12.5%). RL Media conducts the Companys e commerce initiatives through the Polo.com internet site and is consolidated by the Company as the primary beneficiary pursuant to the provisions of FIN 46R. 33 The acquisition cost was $175 million. In addition, Value Vision International, Inc. entered into a transition services agreement with the Company to provide order fulfillment and related services over a period of up to seventeen months from the date of the acquisition of the RL Media minority interest. The Company expects the acquisition of the RL Media minority interest to have a dilutive effect on profitability in Fiscal 2008 due primarily to the non cash costs to be recognized in connection with the allocation of a portion of the purchase price to inventory and certain intangible assets. Formation of Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Joint Venture On March 5, 2007, the Company announced that it had agreed to form a joint venture with Financiere Richemont SA (Richemont), the Swiss Luxury Goods Group. The 50 50 joint venture will be a Swiss corporation named the Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Company, S.A.R.L. (the RL Watch Company), whose purpose is to design, develop, manufacture, sell and distribute luxury watches and fine jewelry through Ralph Lauren boutiques, as well as through fine independent jewelry and luxury watch retailers throughout the world. The Company expects to account for its 50% interest in the RL Watch Company under the equity method of accounting. Royalty payments due to the Company under the related license agreement for use of certain of the Companys trademarks will be reflected as licensing revenue within the consolidated statement of operations. The RL Watch Company is expected to commence operations during the first quarter of Fiscal 2008. The Company expects to incur certain start up costs in Fiscal 2008 to support the launch of this business. However, the business is not expected to generate any sales until Fiscal 2009 as products are scheduled to be launched in the fall of calendar 2008. Global Brand Concepts and Launch of American Living On January 8, 2007, the Company announced it will begin to develop new lifestyle brands for specialty and department stores through its Global Brand Concepts (GBC) group. The GBC group will work in partnership with select department and specialty stores and contribute its expertise in design, operations, marketing, merchandising and advertising in developing exclusive brands for those stores. Consistent with this strategic initiative, on February 1, 2007, the Company announced plans to launch American Living, a new lifestyle brand created exclusively for J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCPenney). American Living will include a full range of merchandise for women, men and children, as well as intimate apparel, accessories and home products. The Company expects to incur certain start up costs in Fiscal 2008 to support the launch of this new product line. However, the Company is not expected to generate any significant sales in Fiscal 2008 as the American Living product line is not scheduled to be available at JCPenney stores until the spring of calendar 2008. Eyewear Licensing Agreement In February 2006, the Company announced that it had entered into a ten year exclusive licensing agreement with Luxottica Group, S.p.A. and affiliates (Luxottica) for the design, production, sale and distribution of prescription frames and sunglasses under the Polo Ralph Lauren brand (the Eyewear Licensing Agreement). The Eyewear Licensing Agreement took effect on January 1, 2007 after the Companys pre existing licensing agreement with another licensee expired. In early January, the Company received a prepayment of approximately $180 million, net of certain tax withholdings, in consideration of the annual minimum royalty and design services fees to be earned over the life of the contract. The prepayment is non refundable, except with respect to certain breaches of the agreement by the Company, in which case only the unearned portion of the prepayment as determined based on the specific terms of the agreement would be required to be repaid (see Note 22 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion). See Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Companys acquisitions and joint venture formed during the fiscal years presented. 34 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 The following table summarizes our results of operations and expresses the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain financial statements captions: Fiscal Years Ended March 31, April 1, Increase/ 2007 2006 (Decrease) % Change (millions) Net revenues $ 4,295.4 $ 3,746.3 $ 549.1 14.7 % Cost of goods sold(a) (1,959.2 ) (1,723.9 ) (235.3 ) 13.7 % Gross profit 2,336.2 2,022.4 313.8 15.5 % Gross profit as % of net revenues 54.4 % 54.0 % Selling, general and administrative expenses(a) (1,663.4 ) (1,476.9 ) (186.5 ) 12.6 % SGA as % of net revenues 38.7 % 39.4 % Amortization of intangible assets (15.6 ) (9.1 ) (6.5 ) 71.4 % Impairments of retail assets (10.8 ) 10.8 (100.0 )% Restructuring charges (4.6 ) (9.0 ) 4.4 (48.9 )% Operating income 652.6 516.6 136.0 26.3 % Operating income as % of net revenues 15.2 % 13.8 % Foreign currency gains (losses) (1.5 ) (5.7 ) 4.2 (73.7 )% Interest expense (21.6 ) (12.5 ) (9.1 ) 72.8 % Interest income 26.1 13.7 12.4 90.5 % Equity in income of equity method investees 3.0 4.3 (1.3 ) (30.2 )% Minority interest expense (15.3 ) (13.5 ) (1.8 ) 13.3 % Income before provision for income taxes 643.3 502.9 140.4 27.9 % Provision for income taxes (242.4 ) (194.9 ) (47.5 ) 24.4 % Effective tax rate(b) 37.7 % 38.8 % Net income $ 400.9 $ 308.0 $ 92.9 30.2 % Net income per share Basic $ 3.84 $ 2.96 $ 0.88 29.8 % Net income per share Diluted $ 3.73 $ 2.87 $ 0.86 30.0 % (a) Includes total depreciation expense of $129.1 million and $117.9 million for Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006, respectively. (b) Effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before provision for income taxes. Net Revenues. Net revenues increased by $549.1 million, or 14.7%, to $4.295 billion in Fiscal 2007 from $3.746 billion in Fiscal 2006. The increase was experienced in all geographic regions and was due to a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Wholesale revenues increased by $373.4 million, primarily as a result of revenues from the newly acquired Polo Jeans Business, the successful launch of the new Chaps for women and children product lines, and increased sales in our global menswear and womenswear product lines. The increase in net revenues also was driven by a revenue increase of $184.6 million in our Retail segment as a result of improved comparable global retail store sales, continued store expansion (including our new Tokyo flagship store) and growth in Polo.com sales. Licensing revenue decreased by $8.9 million primarily due to the loss of product licensing 35 revenue related to the Polo Jeans and Footwear Businesses (now included as part of the Wholesale segment). Net revenues for our three business segments are provided below: Fiscal Years Ended March 31, April 1, Increase/ 2007 2006 (Decrease) % Change (millions) Net Revenues: Wholesale $ 2,315.9 $ 1,942.5 $ 373.4 19.2 % Retail 1,743.2 1,558.6 184.6 11.8 % Licensing 236.3 245.2 (8.9 ) (3.6 )% Total net revenues $ 4,295.4 $ 3,746.3 $ 549.1 14.7 % Wholesale net sales the net increase primarily reflects: the inclusion of $190 million of revenues from our newly acquired Footwear and Polo Jeans Businesses; a $156 million aggregate net increase led by our global menswear, womenswear and childrenswear businesses, primarily driven by strong growth in our Lauren product line, increased full price sell through performance in our menswear business and the effects from the successful domestic launch of our new Chaps for women and children product lines. These increases were partially offset by a decline in footwear sales (excluding the impact from acquisition) due to our planned integration efforts as we repositioned the related product line; and a $27 million increase in revenues due to a favorable foreign currency effect, primarily related to the strengthening of the Euro in comparison to the U.S. dollar in Fiscal 2007. Retail net sales For purposes of the discussion of retail operating performance below, we refer to the measure comparable store sales. Comparable store sales refer to the growth of sales in stores that are open for at least one full fiscal year. Sales for stores that are closing during a fiscal year are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. Sales for stores that are either relocated, enlarged (as defined by gross square footage expansion of 25% or greater) or closed for 30 or more consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales until stores have been in their location for at least a full fiscal year. Comparable store sales information includes both Ralph Lauren stores and Club Monaco stores. The increase in retail net sales primarily reflects: an aggregate $104 million increase in comparable full price and factory store sales on a global basis. This increase was driven by a 6.6% increase in comparable full price Ralph Lauren store sales, a 10.9% increase in comparable full price Club Monaco store sales, and an 8.1% increase in comparable factory store sales. Excluding a net aggregate favorable $9 million effect on revenues from foreign currency exchange rates, comparable full price Ralph Lauren store sales increased 5.7%, comparable full price Club Monaco store sales increased 10.9%, and comparable factory store sales increased 7.5%; an increase in sales from non comparable stores, primarily relating to new store openings within the past fiscal year. There was a net increase in global store count of 3 stores compared to the prior fiscal year, to a total of 292 stores. The net increase in store count was primarily due to several new openings of full price stores, partially offset by the closure of certain Club Monaco Caban Concept and factory stores and Polo Jeans factory stores; and a $26 million increase in sales at Polo.com. Licensing revenue the net decrease primarily reflects: the loss of licensing revenues from our Polo Jeans and Footwear Businesses now included as part of the Wholesale segment; 36 a decline in eyewear related royalties due to the wind down of the Companys pre existing licensing agreement prior to the commencement of the new Eyewear Licensing Agreement which took effect on January 1, 2007; a decline in Home licensing royalties; and a partially offsetting increase in international licensing royalties and the accelerated receipt and recognition of approximately $8 million of minimum royalty and design service fees in connection with the termination of a domestic license agreement during Fiscal 2007. Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold increased by $235.3 million, or 13.7%, to $1.959 billion in Fiscal 2007 from $1.724 billion in Fiscal 2006. Cost of goods sold expressed as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 45.6% in Fiscal 2007 from 46.0% in Fiscal 2006. The net reduction in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues primarily reflects the ongoing focus on improved inventory management, including sourcing efficiencies and reduced markdown activity as a result of better full price sell through of our products. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased by $313.8 million, or 15.5%, to $2.336 billion in Fiscal 2007 from $2.022 billion in Fiscal 2006. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues also increased to 54.4% in Fiscal 2007 from 54.0% in Fiscal 2006. The increase in gross profit reflected higher net sales and improved merchandise margins in our wholesale and retail businesses, including the continued emphasis on shifting the mix from off price to full price sales across our wholesale product lines, as well as the focus on improved inventory management discussed above. However, the overall improvement in gross profit margins was partially offset by the lower gross profit performance of our newly acquired Polo Jeans Business associated with the liquidation of existing inventory in anticipation of the redesign and launch of our new denim and casual sportswear product lines during spring of calendar 2007. Gross profit margins related to our Footwear Business have also been negatively impacted during Fiscal 2007, primarily by integration efforts as we repositioned the related product line. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SGA expenses primarily include compensation and benefits, marketing, distribution, information technology, facilities, legal and other costs associated with finance and administration. SGA expenses increased by $186.5 million, or 12.6%, to $1.663 billion in Fiscal 2007 from $1.477 billion in Fiscal 2006. SGA expenses as a percent of net revenues decreased to 38.7% in Fiscal 2007 from 39.4% in Fiscal 2006. The 70 basis point improvement is primarily indicative of our ability to successfully leverage our global infrastructure as we acquire businesses and grow product lines organically. The $186.5 million net increase in SGA expenses was primarily driven by: higher compensation related expenses (excluding stock based compensation) of approximately $69 million, principally relating to increased selling costs associated with higher retail sales and our ongoing worldwide retail store and product line expansion, and higher investment in infrastructure to support the ongoing growth of our businesses; the inclusion of SGA costs for our newly acquired Footwear and Polo Jeans Businesses, including costs incurred pursuant to transition service arrangements; a $38 million increase in brand related marketing and facilities costs to support the ongoing growth of our businesses; an approximate $10 million increase in depreciation costs in connection with our increased capital expenditures and global expansion; incremental stock based compensation expense of approximately $17 million as a result of the adoption of FAS 123R as of April 2, 2006 (see Note 18 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion); and a net reduction in credit card contingency charges of approximately $4 million. The Company expects to incur significantly greater stock based compensation expense in Fiscal 2008 as compared to the related expense recognized in Fiscal 2007 primarily due to the approximate 45% increase in the Companys share price during Fiscal 2007. 37 Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets increased by $6.5 million, to $15.6 million in Fiscal 2007 from $9.1 million in Fiscal 2006. The increase was due to the amortization of intangible assets related to the Polo Jeans Business acquired in February 2006 and the Footwear Business acquired in July 2005. Impairments of Retail Assets. A non cash impairment charge of $10.8 million was recognized during Fiscal 2006 to reduce the carrying value of fixed assets largely relating to our Club Monaco brand. No impairment charges were recognized in Fiscal 2007. Restructuring Charges. Restructuring charges decreased by $4.4 million, to $4.6 million in Fiscal 2007 from $9.0 million in Fiscal 2006. Restructuring charges recognized in both periods were principally associated with the Club Monaco retail business. See Note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Operating Income. Operating income increased by $136.0 million, or 26.3%, to $652.6 million in Fiscal 2007 from $516.6 million in Fiscal 2006. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased 140 basis points, to 15.2% in Fiscal 2007 from 13.8% in Fiscal 2006, reflecting our revenue growth, gross profit percentage expansion and improved SGA expense leveraging. Operating income for our three business segments is provided below: Fiscal Years Ended March 31, April 1, Increase/ 2007 2006 (Decrease) % Change (millions) Operating Income: Wholesale $ 477.8 $ 398.3 $ 79.5 20.0 % Retail 224.2 140.0 84.2 60.1 % Licensing 141.6 153.5 (11.9 ) (7.8 )% 843.6 691.8 151.8 21.9 % Less: Unallocated corporate expenses (183.4 ) (159.1 ) (24.3 ) 15.3 % Unallocated legal and restructuring charges (7.6 ) (16.1 ) 8.5 (52.8 )% Total operating income $ 652.6 $ 516.6 $ 136.0 26.3 % Wholesale operating income increased by $79.5 million, primarily as a result of higher net sales and improved gross margin rates in most product lines, as well as the incremental contribution from the newly acquired Polo Jeans Business and the new Chaps product lines. These increases were partially offset by increases in SGA expenses in support of new product lines across all geographic territories and higher amortization expenses associated with intangible assets recognized in acquisitions. Retail operating income increased by $84.2 million, primarily as a result of increased net sales and improved gross margin rates, as well as the absence of a non cash impairment charge of $10.8 million recognized in Fiscal 2006. These increases were partially offset by an increase in selling related salaries and associated costs in connection with the increase in retail sales, including Polo.com, and worldwide store expansion, including the new Tokyo flagship store. Licensing operating income decreased by $11.9 million primarily due to the loss of royalty income formerly collected in connection with the Footwear and Polo Jeans Businesses, which have now been acquired. The decline in Home royalties also contributed to the decrease along with the decline in eyewear royalties, due to the wind down of the Companys pre existing licensing agreement. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in international royalties, as well as the accelerated receipt and recognition of approximately $8 million of minimum royalty and design service fees in connection with the termination of a domestic license agreement during Fiscal 2007. Unallocated corporate expenses increased by $24.3 million, primarily as a result of increases in brand related marketing, payroll related and facilities costs to support the ongoing growth of our businesses. The increase in 38 compensation related costs includes higher stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of FAS 123R (as further discussed in Note 18 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements). Unallocated legal and restructuring charges were $7.6 million during Fiscal 2007, compared to $16.1 million during Fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 charges were principally associated with the Club Monaco Restructuring Plan charges of $4.0 million (as defined in Note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements) and costs of $3.0 million related to the Credit Card Matters (as defined in Note 15 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements). Fiscal 2006 charges also primarily included the Club Monaco Restructuring Plan charges of $9.0 million and legal costs of $6.8 million associated with the Credit Card Matters. Foreign Currency Gains (Losses). The effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss of $1.5 million in Fiscal 2007, compared to a loss of $5.7 million in Fiscal 2006. The decrease in foreign currency losses compared to the prior fiscal year is due to the timing of the settlement of intercompany receivables and payables (that were not of a long term investment nature) between certain of our international and domestic subsidiaries. Foreign currency gains and losses are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. Interest Expense. Interest expense includes the borrowing cost of our outstanding debt, including amortization of debt issuance costs and the loss (gain) on interest rate swap hedging contracts. Interest expense increased by $9.1 million to $21.6 million in Fiscal 2007 from $12.5 million in Fiscal 2006. The increase is primarily due to an increase in interest on capitalized leases due to additional obligations in Fiscal 2007 compared to the prior fiscal year and overlapping interest on debt during the period between the issuance of the 2006 Euro Debt and the repayment of the 1999 Euro Debt. In addition, prior year interest expense was favorably impacted by the interest rate swap agreements which were terminated at the end of Fiscal 2006. Interest Income. Interest income increased by $12.4 million, to $26.1 million in Fiscal 2007 from $13.7 million in Fiscal 2006. This increase is primarily driven by higher average interest rates and higher balances on our invested excess cash. Equity in Income of Equity Method Investees. Equity in the income of equity method investees decreased by $1.3 million, to $3.0 million in Fiscal 2007 from $4.3 million in Fiscal 2006. This income relates to our 20% investment in Impact 21, a company that holds the sublicense with PRL Japan for our mens, womens and jeans businesses in Japan. See Recent Developments for further discussion of the Companys Japanese Business Acquisitions that occurred in May 2007. Minority Interest Expense. Minority interest expense increased by $1.8 million, to $15.3 million in Fiscal 2007 from $13.5 million in Fiscal 2006. The net increase is primarily related to the improved operating performance of RL Media compared to the prior period and the associated allocation of income to the minority partners. As of March 28, 2007, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in RL Media held by the minority partners (see Recent Developments for further discussion). Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by $47.5 million, or 24.4%, to $242.4 million in Fiscal 2007 from $194.9 million in Fiscal 2006. This increase is a result of the increase in our pre tax income, partially offset by a decrease in our reported effective tax rate, to 37.7% in Fiscal 2007 from 38.8% in Fiscal 2006. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings, which resulted in more income being taxed at lower rates than in the previous fiscal year. The effective tax rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses. Our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on non recurring and recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and amount of foreign dividends, enacted tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax audit findings and settlements, and the interaction of various global tax strategies. See Critical Accounting Policies for a discussion on the accounting for uncertain tax positions and the Companys adoption of FIN 48 in Fiscal 2008. Net Income. Net income increased by $92.9 million, or 30.2%, to $400.9 million in Fiscal 2007 from $308.0 million in Fiscal 2006. The increase in net income principally related to our $136.0 million increase in operating income, as previously discussed, offset in part by an increase of $47.5 million in our provision for income taxes. 39 Net Income Per Diluted Share. Net income per diluted share increased by $0.86, or 30.0%, to $3.73 per share in Fiscal 2007 from $2.87 per share in Fiscal 2006. The increase in diluted per share results was primarily due to the higher level of net income, partially offset by higher weighted average diluted shares outstanding for Fiscal 2007. Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 The following table summarizes our results of operations and expresses the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain financial statements captions: Fiscal Years Ended April 1, April 2, Increase/ 2006 2005 (Decrease) % Change (millions) Net revenues $ 3,746.3 $ 3,305.4 $ 440.9 13.3 % Cost of goods sold(a) (1,723.9 ) (1,620.9 ) (103.0 ) 6.4 % Gross profit 2,022.4 1,684.5 337.9 20.1 % Gross profit as % of net revenues 54.0 % 51.0 % Selling, general and administrative expenses(a) (1,476.9 ) (1,377.6 ) (99.3 ) 7.2 % SGA as % of net revenues 39.4 % 41.7 % Amortization of intangible assets (9.1 ) (3.4 ) (5.7 ) 167.6 % Impairments of retail assets (10.8 ) (1.5 ) (9.3 ) 620.0 % Restructuring charges (9.0 ) (2.3 ) (6.7 ) 291.3 % Operating income 516.6 299.7 216.9 72.4 % Operating income as % of net revenues 13.8 % 9.1 % Foreign currency gains (losses) (5.7 ) 6.1 (11.8 ) (193.4 )% Interest expense (12.5 ) (11.0 ) (1.5 ) 13.6 % Interest income 13.7 4.6 9.1 197.8 % Equity in income of equity method investees 4.3 6.4 (2.1 ) (32.8 )% Minority interest expense (13.5 ) (8.0 ) (5.5 ) 68.8 % Income before provision for income taxes 502.9 297.8 205.1 68.9 % Provision for income taxes (194.9 ) (107.4 ) (87.5 ) 81.5 % Effective tax rate(b) 38.8 % 36.1 % Net income $ 308.0 $ 190.4 $ 117.6 61.8 % Net income per share Basic $ 2.96 $ 1.88 $ 1.08 57.4 % Net income per share Diluted $ 2.87 $ 1.83 $ 1.04 56.8 % (a) Includes total depreciation expense of $117.9 million and $98.7 million for Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005, respectively. (b) Effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before provision for income taxes. Net Revenues. Net revenues increased by $440.9 million, or 13.3%, to $3.746 billion in Fiscal 2006 from $3.305 billion in Fiscal 2005. Wholesale revenues increased by $230.4 million, primarily as a result of revenues from the sale of newly acquired Footwear and Polo Jeans products, the inclusion of a full year of sales for our childrenswear business, which was acquired in July 2004 (the Childrenswear Business), the successful launch of the Chaps for women and boys product lines, and increased sales in our global menswear and womenswear product lines. The increase in net revenues also was due to a $210.0 million revenue increase in our Retail segment as a 40 result of improved comparable retail store sales, continued store expansion and growth in Polo.com sales. Net revenues for our three business segments are provided below: Fiscal Years Ended April 1, April 2, Increase/ 2006 2005 (Decrease) % Change (millions) Net Revenues: Wholesale $ 1,942.5 $ 1,712.1 $ 230.4 13.5 % Retail 1,558.6 1,348.6 210.0 15.6 % Licensing 245.2 244.7 0.5 0.2 % Total net revenues $ 3,746.3 $ 3,305.4 $ 440.9 13.3 % Wholesale net sales the net increase primarily reflects: the inclusion of $58 million of revenue from the newly acquired Footwear Business; the inclusion of $35 million of revenues from the newly acquired Polo Jeans Business; a $74 million increase in revenues from our childrenswear product line that was acquired in July 2004, including the effects from the successful launch of our Chaps for boys product line and a one time benefit of $59 million due to the inclusion of a full year of sales in Fiscal 2006; a $73 million aggregate constant dollar increase in our global menswear and womenswear businesses, primarily driven by strong growth in our Lauren product line and the effects from the successful domestic launch of our Chaps for women product line; and a $14 million decrease in revenues due to an unfavorable foreign currency effect relating to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar in comparison to the Euro during Fiscal 2006. Retail net sales the net increase primarily reflects: an aggregate $74 million increase in comparable full price and factory store sales. This increase was driven by a 6.0% increase in comparable full price Ralph Lauren store sales, a 8.1% increase in comparable full price Club Monaco store sales, and a 6.3% increase in comparable factory store sales. Excluding an unfavorable aggregate $4 million effect on revenues from foreign currency exchange rates, comparable full price Ralph Lauren store sales increased 6.6%, comparable full price Club Monaco store sales increased 8.1%, and comparable factory store sales increased 6.6%; a net increase in global store count of 11 stores compared to the prior year, to a total of 289 stores, as several new openings were offset by the closure of certain Club Monaco stores in the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2006; and a $29 million increase in sales at Polo.com. Licensing revenues Licensing revenues were essentially flat in Fiscal 2006 compared to Fiscal 2005, as increased revenue from our international licensing business and the domestic launch of the Chaps brand extensions for the menswear and accessories businesses offset the decreases in product licensing revenue resulting from our Fiscal 2006 purchase of the Footwear and Polo Jeans Businesses (now included as part of the Wholesale segment). Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold increased by $103.0 million, or 6.4%, to $1.724 billion in Fiscal 2006 from $1.621 billion in Fiscal 2005. Cost of goods sold expressed as a percentage of net revenues decreased to 46.0% in Fiscal 2006 from 49.0% in Fiscal 2005. The net reduction in cost of goods sold as a percentage of net revenues primarily reflected a continued focus on sourcing efficiencies and reduced markdown activity as a result of better full price sell through of our products. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased by $337.9 million, or 20.1%, to $2.022 billion in Fiscal 2006 from $1.685 billion in Fiscal 2005. This increase reflected higher net sales, improved merchandise margins and sourcing efficiencies, generally across our wholesale and retail businesses. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues also 41 increased to 54.0% in Fiscal 2006 from 51.0% in Fiscal 2005. This 300 basis point increase resulted primarily from the factors discussed above and a shift in mix away from off price sales towards more full price sales in our Wholesale segment. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SGA expenses increased by $99.3 million, or 7.2%, to $1.477 billion in Fiscal 2006 from $1.378 billion in Fiscal 2005. SGA expenses in Fiscal 2005 included a $100 million charge in connection with the Jones related Litigation. On a reported basis, SGA as a percent of net revenues decreased by 2.2%, to 39.4% in Fiscal 2006 from 41.7% in Fiscal 2005. However, excluding the effect from the Jones related Litigation charge, SGA as a percentage of net revenues increased by 0.8%, to 39.4% in Fiscal 2006 from 38.7% in Fiscal 2005. Excluding the Jones related Litigation charge, the $199.3 million net increase in SGA was primarily driven by: higher payroll related expenses of approximately $89 million, principally related to increased selling costs associated with higher retail sales and our worldwide retail store expansion, higher stock based compensation charges associated with our strong operating performance and increasing stock price, and higher investment in infrastructure to support the ongoing growth of our businesses; an increase in brand related marketing and facilities costs of approximately $69 million to support the ongoing growth of our businesses; higher depreciation costs of approximately $19 million in connection with our increased capital expenditures and global expansion; and the inclusion of SGA costs for our newly acquired Footwear and Polo Jeans Businesses, and the costs for the Childrenswear Business for a full year. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets increased by $5.7 million, to $9.1 million in Fiscal 2006 from $3.4 million in Fiscal 2005. The increase related to the addition of intangible assets acquired as part of the Childrenswear Business in July 2004, the Footwear Business in July 2005 and the Polo Jeans Business in February 2006. Impairments of Retail Assets. A non cash impairment charge of $10.8 million was recognized during Fiscal 2006 to reduce the carrying value of fixed assets used in certain of our retail stores, largely related to our Club Monaco retail business that includes our Caban Concept and Club Monaco factory stores. This impairment charge primarily related to lower than expected store performance and preceded the implementation of a plan to restructure these operations in February 2006. A $1.5 million impairment charge also was recognized in Fiscal 2005 related to Club Monaco retail stores. Restructuring Charges. Restructuring charges increased by $6.7 million, to $9.0 million in Fiscal 2006 from $2.3 million in Fiscal 2005. The Fiscal 2006 restructuring charge related to the Club Monaco retail business and included the intended closure of all five Club Monaco factory stores and the intended disposal of all eight of Club Monacos Caban Concept stores. The Fiscal 2005 restructuring charge principally related to severance obligations incurred in connection with a consolidation of our European operations. 42 Operating Income. Operating income increased by $216.9 million, or 72.4%, to $516.6 million in Fiscal 2006 from $299.7 million in Fiscal 2005. Operating income for Fiscal 2005 was reduced by the $100 million Jones related Litigation charge. Operating income for our three business segments is provided below: Fiscal Years Ended April 1, April 2, Increase/ 2006 2005 (Decrease) % Change (millions) Operating Income: Wholesale $ 398.3 $ 299.7 $ 98.6 32.9 % Retail 140.0 82.8 57.2 69.1 % Licensing 153.5 159.5 (6.0 ) (3.8 )% 691.8 542.0 149.8 27.6 % Less: Unallocated corporate expenses (159.1 ) (133.8 ) (25.3 ) 18.9 % Unallocated legal and restructuring charges (16.1 ) (108.5 ) 92.4 (85.2 )% Total operating income $ 516.6 $ 299.7 $ 216.9 72.4 % Wholesale operating income increased by $98.6 million, primarily as a result of higher sales and improved gross margin rates, partially offset by increases in SGA expenses and higher amortization expenses associated with intangible assets recognized in acquisitions. Retail operating income increased by $57.2 million, primarily as a result of increased net sales and improved gross margin rates. These increases were partially offset by an increase in selling salaries and related costs in connection with the increase in retail sales and worldwide store expansion, along with higher retail store impairment charges. Licensing operating income decreased by $6.0 million, primarily due to the loss of royalty income formerly collected in connection with the Footwear, Polo Jeans, and Childrenswear Businesses, which have now been acquired. This decrease was partially offset by improved sell through in our international licensing businesses. Unallocated corporate expenses increased by $25.3 million, primarily as a result of increases in brand related marketing, payroll related and facilities costs to support the ongoing growth of our businesses. Unallocated legal and restructuring charges. Unallocated legal and restructuring charges decreased by $92.4 million, to $16.1 million in Fiscal 2006 from $108.5 million in Fiscal 2005. Unallocated legal and restructuring charges included a $100 million Jones related Litigation charge in Fiscal 2005. No related charge was recognized in Fiscal 2006. The decrease was offset in part by higher restructuring charges of $9.0 million related to the Club Monaco Restructuring Plan and legal costs of $6.8 million associated with the credit card contingency recognized in Fiscal 2006. Foreign Currency Gains (Losses). The effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss of $5.7 million during Fiscal 2006, compared to a $6.1 million gain during Fiscal 2005. The increased losses in Fiscal 2006 primarily related to unfavorable foreign exchange movements associated with intercompany receivables and payables that were not of a long term investment nature and were settled by our international subsidiaries. These gains and losses are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $1.5 million, to $12.5 million in Fiscal 2006 from $11.0 million in Fiscal 2005. This increase was principally related to higher variable interest rates during the year under our interest rate swap agreements that were subsequently terminated. Interest Income. Interest income increased by $9.1 million, to $13.7 million in Fiscal 2006 from $4.6 million in Fiscal 2005. This increase principally related to a higher level of excess cash reinvestment and higher interest rates on our investments during Fiscal 2006. 43 Equity in Income of Equity Method Investees. Equity in the income of equity method investees decreased by $2.1 million, to $4.3 million in Fiscal 2006 from $6.4 million in Fiscal 2005. The decrease principally related to higher amortization in Fiscal 2006 of a basis difference associated with our 20% investment in Impact 21. See Recent Developments for further discussion of the Companys Japanese Business Acquisitions that occurred in May 2007. Minority Interest Expense. Minority interest expense increased by $5.5 million, to $13.5 million in Fiscal 2006 from $8.0 million in Fiscal 2005. The net increase is primarily related to the improved operating performance of RL Media compared to the prior period and the associated allocation of income to the minority partners. As of March 28, 2007, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in RL Media held by the minority partners (see Recent Developments for further discussion). Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by $87.5 million, or 81.5%, to $194.9 million in Fiscal 2006 from $107.4 million in Fiscal 2005. This increase is a result of an increase in our effective tax rate to 38.8% in Fiscal 2006 from 36.1% in Fiscal 2005, as well as the increase in our pre tax income. The increase in our effective tax rate principally resulted from the continued growth of our domestic wholesale and retail businesses, which led to a higher state tax impact. Net Income. Net income increased by $117.6 million, or 61.8%, to $308.0 million in Fiscal 2006 from $190.4 million in Fiscal 2005. The increase in net income principally related to the $216.9 million increase in operating income previously discussed, including the effect of the $100 million Jones related Litigation charge recognized in Fiscal 2005. These benefits were offset in part by higher foreign currency losses of $11.8 million and higher taxes of $87.5 million. Net Income Per Diluted Share. Net income per diluted share increased by $1.04, or 56.8%, to $2.87 in Fiscal 2006 from $1.83 in Fiscal 2005. The improvement in diluted per share results was due to the higher level of net income and the absence of the $100 million Jones related Litigation charge recognized in Fiscal 2005, offset in part by higher dilution associated with higher average shares outstanding in Fiscal 2006. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Financial Condition March 31, April 1, Increase/ 2007 2006 (Decrease) (millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 563.9 $ 285.7 $ 278.2 Current maturities of debt (280.4 ) 280.4 Long term debt (398.8 ) (398.8 ) Net cash(a) $ 165.1 $ 5.3 $ 159.8 Stockholders equity $ 2,334.9 $ 2,049.6 $ 285.3 (a) Defined as total cash and cash equivalents less total debt. The increase in the Companys net cash position principally relates to its growth in operating cash flows (including approximately $180 million of net proceeds received in conjunction with the Eyewear Licensing Agreement) and the excess proceeds raised through the third quarter refinancing of its Euro debt, partially offset by the $175 million use of cash to fund the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in RL Media that it did not previously own, $184 million of capital expenditures and $231 million to repurchase shares of common stock in connection with its common stock repurchase program. The increase in stockholders equity principally relates to the Companys strong earnings growth during Fiscal 2007 and proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, offset in part by the effects from its common stock repurchase program. 44 Cash Flows Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Fiscal Years Ended March 31, April 1, Increase/ 2007 2006 (Decrease) (millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 796.1 $ 449.1 $ 347.0 Net cash used in investing activities (434.6 ) (539.2 ) 104.6 Net cash (used in) provided by financing activities (95.2 ) 33.5 (128.7 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 11.9 (8.2 ) 20.1 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 278.2 $ (64.8 ) $ 343.0 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $796.1 million during Fiscal 2007, compared to $449.1 million for Fiscal 2006. This $347.0 million increase in operating cash flow was driven primarily by the increase in net income, the receipt of approximately $180 million under the new Eyewear Licensing Agreement (net of certain tax withholdings) and the absence of the $100 million payment to settle the Jones related Litigation in Fiscal 2006, partially offset by higher tax payments made in Fiscal 2007. Also offsetting the increase in operating cash flow was an increase in working capital needs during Fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of recent expansions and the overall growth in the business. This increase was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable days sales outstanding as a result of improved cash collections in the Companys Wholesale segment. On a comparative basis, operating cash flows were reduced by $33.7 million as a result of a change in the reporting of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation arrangements. That is, prior to the adoption of FAS 123R, benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs were reported as operating cash flows. FAS 123R requires excess tax benefits to be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than in operating cash flows as a reduction of taxes paid. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $434.6 million for Fiscal 2007, as compared to $539.2 million for Fiscal 2006. The net decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to acquisition related activities. In Fiscal 2007, the Company used $175 million to fund the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in RL Media that it did not previously own, whereas in Fiscal 2006, approximately $380 million was used primarily to fund the acquisition of the Polo Jeans and Footwear Businesses. In addition, net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2007 included $74.5 million of restricted cash placed in escrow with certain banks as collateral to secure guarantees of a corresponding amount made by the banks to certain international tax authorities on behalf of the Company (see Note 3 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion). Net cash used in investing activities also included $184.0 million relating to capital expenditures, as compared to $158.6 million in the comparable prior year. Net Cash (Used in)/Provided by Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $95.2 million for Fiscal 2007, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $33.5 million in Fiscal 2006. The increase in net cash used in financing activities during Fiscal 2007 principally related to the repayment of approximately 227 million principal amount ($291.6 million) of the Companys 1999 Euro Debt and the repurchase of 3.5 million shares of Class A common stock pursuant to its common stock repurchase program at a cost of $231.3 million. Partially offsetting the increase was the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of 300 million principal amount (approximately $380 million) of 2006 Euro Debt. This net increase in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by the change in the reporting of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation arrangements of $33.7 million. 45 Fiscal 2006 Compared to Fiscal 2005 Fiscal Years Ended April 1, April 2, Increase/ 2006 2005 (Decrease) (millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 449.1 $ 382.0 $ 67.1 Net cash used in investing activities (539.2 ) (417.4 ) (121.8 ) Net cash provided by financing activities 33.5 31.5 2.0 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (8.2 ) 2.1 (10.3 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (64.8 ) $ (1.8 ) $ (63.0 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $449.1 million during Fiscal 2006, compared to $382.0 million in Fiscal 2005. This $67.1 million increase in cash flow was driven primarily by an increase in net income and lower working capital requirements, partially offset by a $100 million payment to settle the Jones related Litigation. The lower working capital requirements in Fiscal 2006 primarily related to a decrease in accounts receivable days sales outstanding as a result of improved cash collections in the Companys Wholesale segment, partially offset by higher inventory balances primarily due to the newly acquired Polo Jeans and Footwear Businesses. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $539.2 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to $417.4 million in Fiscal 2005. The increase in cash used in investing activities principally related to acquisition related activities. In Fiscal 2006, the Company used approximately $380 million primarily to fund the acquisition of the Polo Jeans and Footwear Businesses, whereas in Fiscal 2005, approximately $243 million was used principally to fund the acquisition of the Childrenswear Business. In addition, net cash used in investing activities included capital expenditures of $158.6 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to $174.1 million in Fiscal 2005. Net Cash Provided by Financing Activities. Net cash provided by financing activities was $33.5 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to $31.5 million in Fiscal 2005. The $2.0 million increase in cash provided by financing activities was primarily related to the settlement of an interest rate swap agreement and an increase in proceeds received from the exercise of stock options, partially offset by the cost associated with repurchases of common stock. The Company repurchased common stock under its common stock repurchase program at an aggregate cost of approximately $4 million in Fiscal 2006. No shares of common stock were repurchased in Fiscal 2005. Proceeds received from the exercise of stock options were approximately $55 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to approximately $53 million in Fiscal 2005. Cash dividends paid were approximately $21 million in Fiscal 2006, compared to approximately $22 million in Fiscal 2005. Liquidity The Companys primary sources of liquidity are the cash flow generated from its operations, $450 million of availability under its credit facility, available cash and equivalents and other potential sources of financial capacity relating to its under leveraged capital structure. These sources of liquidity are needed to fund the Companys ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, retail store expansion, construction and renovation of shop in shops, investment in technological infrastructure, acquisitions, dividends, debt repayment, stock repurchases and other corporate activities. Management believes that the Companys existing resources of cash will be sufficient to support its operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future, including the acquisitions and plans for business expansion discussed above under the section entitled Recent Developments. As discussed below under the section entitled Debt and Covenant Compliance, the Company had no borrowings under its credit facility as of March 31, 2007. However, as discussed further below, the Company may elect to draw on its credit facility or other potential sources of financing for, among other things, a material acquisition, settlement of a material contingency or a material adverse business development. Also, as discussed below, in October 2006, the Company completed the issuance of 300 million principal amount of 2006 Euro Debt. The Company used the net proceeds from the financing to repay approximately 227 principal amount of its 1999 Euro Debt. The balance of such proceeds was used for general corporate and working capital purposes. The 46 Company also amended its Credit Facility in November 2006, which extended the term to 2011, as a result of recent upgrades in the Companys credit ratings from Standard Poors (to BBB+) and Moodys (to Baa1). See Revolving Credit Facility described below. In May 2007, the Company completed the Japanese Business Acquisitions. These transactions were funded with available cash on hand and approximately $170 million of Yen based borrowings under a one year term loan agreement on terms substantially similar to the Companys existing credit facility (the Term Loan). Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at a LIBOR rate for yen loans for an interest period of 12 months plus the applicable margin. The maturity date of the Term Loan is on the 12 month anniversary of the drawing date of the Term Loan. The Company expects to repay the borrowing by its maturity date using a portion of Impact 21s cash on hand of approximately $200 million acquired as part of the acquisition. Common Stock Repurchase Program In November 2006, the Companys Board of Directors approved an expansion of the Companys existing common stock repurchase program that allows the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of Class A common stock. Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are subject to overall business and market conditions. In Fiscal 2007, share repurchases under the expanded and pre existing programs amounted to 3.5 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $231.3 million. The remaining availability under the common stock repurchase program was $368.3 million as of March 31, 2007. In Fiscal 2006, the Company repurchased 69.3 thousand shares of Class A common stock at a cost of approximately $4 million. No shares of Class A common stock were repurchased in Fiscal 2005. Dividends The Company intends to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends on its outstanding common stock. However, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, the Companys results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. The Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per outstanding share in each quarter of Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006. The aggregate amount of dividend payments was $21 million in Fiscal 2007, $21 million in Fiscal 2006 and $22 million in Fiscal 2005. Debt and Covenant Compliance Euro Debt The Company had outstanding approximately 227 million principal amount of 6.125% notes that were due on November 22, 2006, from an original issuance of 275 million in 1999 (the 1999 Euro Debt). On October 5, 2006, the Company completed a new issuance of 300 million principal amount of 4.50% notes due October 4, 2013 (the 2006 Euro Debt). The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the financing of approximately $380 million (based on the exchange rate in effect upon issuance) to repay the remaining 1999 Euro Debt at par on its maturity date. The balance of such net proceeds was used for general corporate and working capital purposes. The Company has the option to redeem all of the 2006 Euro Debt at any time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus a premium. The Company also has the option to redeem all of the 2006 Euro Debt at any time at par plus accrued interest, in the event of certain developments involving U.S. tax law. Partial redemption of the 2006 Euro Debt is not permitted in either instance. In the event of a change of control of the Company, each holder of the 2006 Euro Debt has the option to require the Company to redeem the 2006 Euro Debt at its principal amount plus accrued interest. As of March 31, 2007, the carrying value of the 2006 Euro Debt was $398.8 million. 47 Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan The Company has a credit facility, which was amended on November 28, 2006, that provides for a $450 million unsecured revolving line of credit (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility also is used to support the issuance of letters of credit. As of March 31, 2007, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility, but the Company was contingently liable for $25.7 million of outstanding letters of credit (primarily relating to inventory purchase commitments). The Company amended certain terms of its Credit Facility as a result of recent upgrades in its credit ratings from Standard Poors and Moodys. Key changes under the amendment include: An increase in the ability of the Company to expand its additional borrowing availability from $525 million to $600 million, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments; An extension of the term of the Credit Facility to November 2011 from October 2009; A reduction in the margin over LIBOR paid by the Company on amounts drawn under the Credit Facility to 35 basis points from 50 basis points; A reduction in the commitment fee for the unutilized portion of the Credit Facility to 8 basis points from 12.5 basis points; and The elimination of the coverage ratio financial covenant. There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing availability throughout the term of the Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Companys option, either at (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (i) the prime commercial lending rate of JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect from time to time and (ii) the weighted average overnight Federal funds rate (as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) plus 50 basis points or (b) a LIBOR rate in effect from time to time, as adjusted for the Federal Reserve Boards Euro currency liabilities maximum reserve percentage plus a margin defined in the Credit Facility (the applicable margin). The applicable margin of 35 basis points is subject to adjustment based on the Companys credit ratings. The Credit Facility was amended as of May 22, 2007 to provide for the addition of a loan in a Japanese yen amount equal to approximately $170 million. The Term Loan was made to Polo JP Acqui B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and is guaranteed by the Company, as well as the other subsidiaries of the Company which currently guarantee the Credit Facility. The proceeds of the Term Loan have been used to finance the Tender Offer and the total related acquisition cost and the acquisition by the Company of the remaining 50% of the shares of PRL Japan the Company did not previously own. Borrowings under the Term Loan bear interest at a LIBOR rate for yen loans for an interest period of 12 months plus the applicable margin. The maturity date of the Term Loan is on the 12 month anniversary of the drawing date of the Term Loan. The Company expects to repay the borrowing by its maturity date using a portion of Impact 21s cash on hand of approximately $200 million acquired as part of the acquisition. See Recent Developments for further discussion of the Japanese Business Acquisitions. In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate of 8 basis points under the terms of the Credit Facility also is subject to adjustment based on the Companys credit ratings. The Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Companys ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens and contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets, including equity interests; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not in a related line of business; make loans, advances or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make investments. In addition, the Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to Consolidated EBITDAR (the leverage ratio), as such terms are defined in the Credit Facility. As of March 31, 2007, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the Credit Facility) has occurred under the Companys Credit Facility. 48 Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The Credit Facility specifies a number of events of default (many of which are subject to applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure to make timely principal and interest payments or to satisfy the covenants, including the financial covenant described above. Additionally, the Credit Facility provides that an Event of Default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and related entities fail to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power of the Companys common stock. Contractual and Other Obligations Firm Commitments The following table summarizes certain of the Companys aggregate contractual obligations as of March 31, 2007, and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on the Companys liquidity and cash flow in future periods. The Company expects to fund the firm commitments with operating cash flow generated in the normal course of business and, if necessary, availability under its $450 million credit facility or other potential sources of financing. Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2013 and 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total (millions) Euro debt $ $ $ $ 398.8 $ 398.8 Capital leases 1.6 2.8 2.6 23.2 30.2 Operating leases 156.7 279.2 208.2 556.8 1,200.9 Inventory purchase commitments 507.2 3.6 510.8 Total $ 665.5 $ 285.6 $ 210.8 $ 978.8 $ 2,140.7 The following is a description of the Companys material, firmly committed contractual obligations as of March 31, 2007: Euro Debt represents the principal amount due at maturity of the Companys outstanding Euro Debt on a U.S. dollar equivalent basis. Amounts do not include any fair value adjustments, call premiums or interest payments; Lease Obligations represent the minimum lease rental payments under noncancelable leases for the Companys real estate and operating equipment in various locations around the world. Approximately 67% of these lease obligations relates to the Companys retail operations. Information has been presented separately for operating and capital leases. In addition to such amounts, the Company is normally required to pay taxes, insurance and occupancy costs relating to its leased real estate properties; and Inventory Purchase Commitments represent the Companys legally binding agreements to purchase fixed or minimum quantities of goods at determinable prices. The Company also has certain contractual arrangements that would require it to make payments if certain circumstances occur. See Note 15 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a description of the Companys contingent commitments not included in the above table. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Companys off balance sheet firm commitments, which include outstanding letters of credit and minimum funding commitments to investees, amounted to approximately $35.9 million as of March 31, 2007. At the end of Fiscal 2007, the Company also was committed to pay a purchase price of approximately $10 million in connection with the acquisition of New Campaign, which closed in April 2007. The Company does not maintain any other off balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon its financial condition or results of operations. 49 MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT The Company has exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain anticipated cash flows generated by its international operations and possible declines in the fair value of reported net assets of certain of its foreign operations, as well as exposure to changes in the fair value of its fixed rate debt relating to changes in interest rates. Consequently, the Company periodically uses derivative financial instruments to manage such risks. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes. The Company monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions that are party to any of its financial transactions. Credit risk related to derivative financial instruments is considered low because the agreements are entered into with strong creditworthy counterparties. The following is a summary of the Companys risk management strategies and the effect of those strategies on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Foreign Currency Risk Management Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts The Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts as hedges primarily relating to identifiable currency positions to reduce its risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases and intercompany royalty payments made by certain of its international operations. As part of its overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily exposure to changes in the value of the Euro and the Japanese Yen, the Company hedges a portion of its foreign currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing twelve month to two year period. In doing so, the Company uses foreign exchange contracts that generally have maturities of three months to two years to provide continuing coverage throughout the hedging period. As of March 31, 2007, the Company had contracts for the sale of $214 million of foreign currencies at fixed rates. Of these $214 million of sales contracts, $180 million were for the sale of Euros and $34 million were for the sale of Japanese Yen. The total fair value of the forward contracts was an unrealized loss of $1.9 million. As of April 1, 2006, the Company had contracts for the sale of $90 million of foreign currencies at fixed rates. Of these $90 million of sales contracts, $22 million were for the sale of Euros and $68 million were for the sale of Japanese Yen. The total fair value of the forward contracts was an unrealized loss of $1.8 million. The Company records foreign currency exchange contracts at fair value in its balance sheet and designates these derivative instruments as cash flow hedges in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and subsequent amendments (collectively, FAS 133). As such, the related gains or losses on these contracts are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. These deferred gains and losses are then either recognized in income in the period in which the related royalties being hedged are received, or in the case of inventory purchases, recognized as part of the cost of the inventory being hedged when sold. However, to the extent that any of these foreign currency exchange contracts are not considered to be perfectly effective in offsetting the change in the value of the royalties or inventory purchases being hedged, any changes in fair value relating to the ineffective portion of these contracts are immediately recognized in earnings. No significant gains or losses relating to ineffective hedges were recognized in the periods presented. The Company had deferred net losses on foreign currency exchange contracts in the amount of approximately $2 million at the end of Fiscal 2007, all of which is expected to be recognized in earnings in Fiscal 2008. Net losses on foreign currency exchange contracts in the amount of approximately $1 million were deferred at the end of Fiscal 2006. The Company recognized net gains on foreign currency exchange contracts in earnings of approximately $4 million for Fiscal 2007 and $5 million for Fiscal 2006. Based on the foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of March 31, 2007, a 10% devaluation of the U.S. dollar as compared to the level of foreign currency exchange rates for currencies under contract as of March 31, 2007 would result in approximately $19 million of net unrealized losses. Conversely, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar would result in approximately $19 million of net unrealized gains. Because the foreign currency exchange contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions, the unrealized loss or gain as a result of a 10% devaluation or appreciation would be largely offset by changes in the underlying hedged items. 50 Subsequent to the end of Fiscal 2007, the Company entered into foreign currency option contracts with a notional value of $159 million for the right, but not the obligation, to purchase foreign currencies at fixed rates. These contracts hedged the majority of the foreign currency exposure related to the financing of the Japanese Business Acquisitions, but do not qualify under FAS 133 for hedge accounting treatment. The Company will recognize a gain or loss, limited to the premium paid for the option contracts, upon the settlement of the contracts during the first quarter of Fiscal 2008. Hedge of a Net Investment in Certain European Subsidiaries Prior to the Companys repayment of the 1999 Euro Debt in November 2006, the entire principal amount was designated as a hedge of the Companys net investment in certain of its European subsidiaries in accordance with FAS 133. Contemporaneous with this repayment, the Company designated the entire principal amount of the 2006 Euro Debt, issued in October 2006 (see Note 13 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion), as a hedge of its net investment in certain of its European subsidiaries. As required by FAS 133, the changes in fair value of a derivative instrument or a non derivative financial instrument (such as debt) that is designated as, and is effective as, a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are reported in the same manner as a translation adjustment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, to the extent it is effective as a hedge. As such, changes in the fair value of the 1999 Euro Debt and the 2006 Euro Debt resulting from changes in the Euro exchange rate have been, and continue to be, reported in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company recorded aggregate gains (losses), net of tax, in stockholders equity on the translation of the 1999 Euro Debt and 2006 Euro Debt to U.S. dollars in the amount of approximately $(19) million for Fiscal 2007, $4 million for Fiscal 2006 and $(18) million for Fiscal 2005. Interest Rate Risk Management Historically, the Company has used floating rate interest rate swap agreements to hedge changes in the fair value of its fixed rate 1999 Euro Debt. These interest rate swap agreements, which effectively converted fixed interest rate payments on the Companys 1999 Euro Debt to a floating rate basis, were designated as a fair value hedge in accordance with FAS 133. All interest rate swap agreements were terminated in late Fiscal 2006 and there were no outstanding agreements at the end of Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006. During the first six months of Fiscal 2007, the Company entered into three forward starting interest rate swap contracts aggregating 200 million notional amount of indebtedness in anticipation of the Companys proposed refinancing of the 1999 Euro Debt, which was completed in October 2006. The Company designated these agreements as a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction to issue new debt in connection with the planned refinancing of its 1999 Euro Debt. The interest rate swaps hedged a total of 200.0 million, a portion of the underlying interest rate exposure on the anticipated refinancing. Under the terms of the three interest swap contracts, the Company paid a weighted average fixed rate of interest of 4.1% and received variable interest based upon six month EURIBOR. The Company terminated the swaps on September 28, 2006, which was the date the interest rate for the 2006 Euro Debt was determined. As a result, the Company made a payment of approximately 3.5 million ($4.4 million based on the exchange rate in effect on that date) in settlement of the swaps. An amount of $0.2 million was recognized as a loss for the three months ending September 30, 2006 due to the partial ineffectiveness of the cash flow hedge as a result of the forecasted transaction closing on October 5, 2006 instead of November 22, 2006 (the maturity date of the 1999 Euro Debt). The remaining loss of $4.2 million has been deferred as a component of comprehensive income within stockholders equity and is being recognized in income as an adjustment to interest expense over the seven year term of the 2006 Euro Debt. As of March 31, 2007, the Company had no variable rate debt outstanding. As such, the Companys exposure to changes in interest rates primarily related to its fixed rate 2006 Euro Debt. As of March 31, 2007, the carrying value of the 2006 Euro Debt was $398.8 million and the fair value was $394.7 million. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of the 2006 Euro Debt by approximately $5 million. Such potential increases or decreases are based on certain simplifying assumptions, including no changes in euro currency exchange rates and an immediate across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period. 51 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The SECs Financial Reporting Release No. 60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies (FRR 60), suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the Companys financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. The Companys estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. The Company believes that the following list represents its critical accounting policies as contemplated by FRR 60. For a discussion of all of the Companys significant accounting policies, see Notes 3 and 4 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements. Sales Allowances and Uncollectible Accounts A significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and net income is estimating the portion of revenues and related receivables that are not realizable. In particular, wholesale revenue is reduced by estimates of returns, discounts, end of season markdown allowances and operational chargebacks. Retail revenue, including e commerce sales, also is reduced by estimates of returns. In determining estimates of returns, discounts, end of season markdown allowances and operational chargebacks, management analyzes historical trends, seasonal results, current economic and market conditions and retailer performance. The Company reviews and refines these estimates on a quarterly basis. The Companys historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. Similarly, management evaluates accounts receivables to determine if they will ultimately be collected. In performing this evaluation, significant judgments and estimates are included, including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for larger accounts and customers, and a receivables aging analysis that determines the percentage of receivables that has historically been uncollected by aged category. Based on this information, management provides a reserve for the estimated amounts believed to be uncollectible. Although management believes that the Companys major customers are sound and creditworthy, a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on the Companys net sales, cash flows and or financial condition. See Accounts Receivable under Note 3 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the activity in the Companys reserves for sales allowances and uncollectible accounts for each of the three fiscal years presented. Inventories The Company holds inventory that is sold through wholesale distribution channels to major department stores and specialty retail stores, including its own retail stores. The Company also holds retail inventory that is sold in its own stores directly to consumers. Wholesale and retail inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value. Cost for wholesale inventories is determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method and cost for retail inventories is determined on a moving average cost basis. The Company continually evaluates the composition of its inventories, assessing slow turning, ongoing product, as well as all fashion product. Estimated realizable value of distressed inventory is determined based on historical sales trends of the Companys individual product lines for this category of inventory, the impact of market trends and economic conditions, and the value of current orders in house relating to the future sales of this category of inventory. Estimates may differ from actual results due to quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions. The Companys historical estimates of these costs and its provisions have not differed materially from actual results. 52 Purchase Accounting The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. As such, the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. In addition, in connection with its recent business acquisitions, the Company has settled certain pre existing relationships. These pre existing relationships include licensing agreements and litigation in the case of the acquisition of the Polo Jeans Business. In accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 1, Accounting for Pre existing Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination, the Company is required to allocate the aggregate consideration exchanged in these transactions between the value of the business acquired and the value of the settlement of any pre existing relationships in proportion to estimates of their respective fair values. If the terms of the pre existing relationships were determined to not be reflective of market, a settlement gain or loss would be recognized in earnings. Accordingly, significant judgment is required to determine the respective fair values of the business acquired and the value of the settlement of the pre existing relationship. The Company has historically utilized independent valuation firms to assist in the determination of fair value. Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS 142). Under FAS 142, goodwill, including any goodwill included in the carrying value of investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually based on comparisons of their respective fair values to their carrying values. Finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long lived assets are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (FAS 144). In accordance with FAS 142, goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary to be performed. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge. To assist management in the process of determining goodwill impairment, the Company obtains appraisals from independent valuation firms. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons and recent transactions. These 53 approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting the risks inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables. The impairment test for other indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the excess. In addition, in evaluating finite lived intangible assets for recoverability, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition in accordance with FAS 144. To the extent the estimated future, undiscounted cash inflows attributable to the asset, less estimated future, undiscounted cash outflows, are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference. There have been no impairment losses recorded in connection with the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets during any of the three fiscal years presented. Impairment of Other Long Lived Assets Property and equipment, along with other long lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable in accordance with FAS 144. In evaluating long lived assets for recoverability, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal, whether through sale or abandonment, are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. In determining future cash flows, the Company takes various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the impact of more experienced retail store managers, the impact of increased local advertising and the emphasis on retail store cost controls. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations. There have been no impairment losses recorded in Fiscal 2007. In Fiscal 2006 and Fiscal 2005, the Company recognized impairment charges on retail fixed assets in the amounts of approximately $11 million and $2 million, respectively. Income Taxes Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method prescribed by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FAS 109). Under this method, income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets and liabilities, taxes currently payable/refunds receivable and tax expense) are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the results of any difference between U.S. GAAP and tax reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of any net operating loss, capital loss and general business credit carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. The financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates is accounted for in the period of enactment. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes. That is, in the ordinary course of a global business, there are many transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. It is the Companys policy to establish reserves for taxes that may become payable in future years as a result of an examination by tax authorities. The Company establishes those reserves based upon managements assessment of the exposure associated with permanent tax differences and tax credits. However, the development of reserves for these exposures requires judgments about tax issues, potential outcomes and timing, and is a subjective critical estimate. In addition, valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. The net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization, as well as the continued application of currently anticipated tax rates. If the Company determines that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable, an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will 54 result in a reduction of earnings at that time. Tax reserves and valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments to those balances. In July 2006, the FASB issued Financial Accounting Standards Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income tax positions. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The evaluation of a tax position in accordance with FIN 48 is a two step process. The Company first will be required to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold will then be measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements based upon the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. FIN 48 is effective for the Company as of the beginning of Fiscal 2008 (April 1, 2007). While the Company continues to analyze the effect from adopting the provisions of FIN 48, it is currently anticipated that a cumulative effect adjustment of up to $85 million will be charged to retained earnings during the first quarter of Fiscal 2008. This estimate is subject to change as the Company completes its analysis. Contingencies The Company periodically is exposed to various contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting its business, including certain litigation, alleged information system security breach matters, contractual disputes, employee relation matters, various tax audits, and trademark and intellectual property matters. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (FAS 5), the Company records a liability for such contingencies to the extent that it concludes their occurrence is probable and the related losses are estimable. In addition, if it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement of a contingency could exceed the established liability, the Company discloses the estimated impact on its liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Management considers many factors in making these assessments. Because the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable, these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions. As a result, the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on estimates and assumptions. Stock Based Compensation Effective April 2, 2006, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123R, Share Based Payment (FAS 123R), using the modified prospective application transition method. Under this transition method, the compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations beginning April 2, 2006 includes compensation expense for (a) all stock based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of April 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure (FAS 123) and (b) all stock based payments granted subsequent to April 1, 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123R. Prior to April 2, 2006, the Company accounted for stock based compensation plans under the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), and adopted the disclosure only provisions of FAS 123. Under this standard, the Company did not recognize compensation expense for the issuance of stock options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price at the date of grant. However, as required, the Company disclosed, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the pro forma expense impact of the stock option grants as if the fair value based recognition provisions of FAS 123 were applied. Compensation expense was previously recognized for restricted stock and restricted stock units. The effect of forfeitures on restricted stock and restricted stock units was recognized when such forfeitures occurred. 55 Stock Options Stock options are granted to employees and non employee directors with exercise prices equal to fair market value at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. Certain key assumptions involve estimating future uncertain events. The key factors influencing the estimation process include the expected term of the option, the expected stock price volatility factor, the expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate, among others. Generally, once stock option values are determined, current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from the actuals. Determining the fair value of stock based compensation at the date of grant requires significant judgment by management, including estimates of the above Black Scholes assumptions. In addition, judgment is required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, if management changes its assumptions for future stock based award grants, or if there are changes in market conditions, stock based compensation expense and the Companys results of operations could be materially impacted. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units The Company grants restricted shares of Class A common stock and service based restricted stock units (RSUs) to certain of its senior executives. In addition, the Company grants performance based RSUs to such senior executives and other key executives, and certain other employees of the Company. The fair values of restricted stock shares and RSUs are based on the fair value of unrestricted Class A common stock, as adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for those restricted securities that are not entitled to dividend equivalents. Compensation expense for performance based RSUs is recognized over the related service period when attainment of the performance goals is deemed probable.
