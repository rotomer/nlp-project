Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for Fiscal 2008 (Fiscal 2008 10 K). We utilize a 52 53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31. As such, fiscal year 2008 ended on March 29, 2008 and reflected a 52 week period (Fiscal 2008); fiscal year 2007 ended on March 31, 2007 and reflected a 52 week period (Fiscal 2007); and fiscal year 2006 ended on April 1, 2006 and also reflected a 52 week period (Fiscal 2006). INTRODUCTION Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MDA) is provided as a supplement to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of our operations. MDA is organized as follows: Overview. This section provides a general description of our business, including our objectives and risks, and a summary of financial performance for Fiscal 2008. In addition, this section includes a discussion of recent developments and transactions affecting comparability that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and financial condition, and in anticipating future trends. Results of operations. This section provides an analysis of our results of operations for Fiscal 2008, Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006. Financial condition and liquidity. This section provides an analysis of our cash flows for Fiscal 2008, Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006, as well as a discussion of our financial condition and liquidity as of March 29, 2008. The discussion of our financial condition and liquidity includes (i) our available financial capacity under our credit facility, (ii) a summary of our key debt compliance measures and (iii) a summary of our outstanding debt and commitments as of March 29, 2008. Market risk management. This section discusses how we manage exposure to potential losses arising from adverse changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in the reported net assets of certain of our international operations. Critical accounting policies. This section discusses accounting policies considered to be important to our financial condition and results of operations, which require significant judgment and estimation on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies, are summarized in Notes 3 and 4 to our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements. Recent accounting standards. This section discusses the potential impact to our reported financial condition and results of operations of accounting standards that have been issued, but which we have not yet adopted. OVERVIEW Our Business Our Company is a global leader in the design, marketing and distribution of premium lifestyle products including mens, womens and childrens apparel, accessories, fragrances and home furnishings. Our long standing reputation and distinctive image have been consistently developed across an expanding number of products, brands and international markets. Our brand names include Polo by Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, 33 Table of Contents Ralph Lauren Collection, Black Label, Blue Label, Lauren by Ralph Lauren, RRL, RLX, Rugby, Ralph Lauren Childrenswear, Chaps, Club Monaco and American Living, among others. We classify our businesses into three segments: Wholesale, Retail and Licensing. Our wholesale business (representing 57% of Fiscal 2008 net revenues) consists of wholesale channel sales made principally to major department stores, specialty stores and golf and pro shops located throughout the U.S., Europe and Asia. Our retail business (representing 39% of Fiscal 2008 net revenues) consists of retail channel sales directly to consumers through full price and factory retail stores located throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, South America and Asia, and through our retail internet site located at www.RalphLauren.com (formerly known as Polo.com). In addition, our licensing business (representing 4% of Fiscal 2008 net revenues) consists of royalty based arrangements under which we license the right to third parties to use our various trademarks in connection with the manufacture and sale of designated products, such as apparel, eyewear and fragrances, in specified geographical areas for specified periods. Approximately 25% of our Fiscal 2008 net revenues was earned in international regions outside of the U.S. and Canada. See Note 20 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of net revenues by geographic location. Our business is affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and key vacation travel, back to school and holiday periods in the Retail segment. Our Objectives and Risks Our core strengths include a portfolio of global luxury lifestyle brands, a strong and experienced management team, a proven ability to develop and extend our brands distributed through multiple retail channels in global markets, a disciplined investment philosophy and a solid balance sheet. Despite the various risks and uncertainties associated with the current global economy as further discussed below, we believe our core strengths will continue to allow us to execute our strategy for long term sustainable growth in revenue, net income and operating cash flow. During the course of the past five fiscal years, our revenues, net income and operating cash flow have grown to record levels. See Selected Financial Information included elsewhere in this Fiscal 2008 10 K for further discussion. Our operating success has been driven by the Companys focus on six key objectives: Creating unique businesses primarily centered around one core and heritage driven brand; Diversifying and expanding our products and prices, distribution channels and geographic regions; Improving brand control and positioning; Focusing on selective strategic partnerships; Implementing infrastructure improvements that support a worldwide business; and Funding our expansion through strong operating cash flow. As our business has grown, our portfolio mix and brand control has evolved from primarily that of a mono brand U.S. centric menswear wholesaler with a broad array of product and geographic licenses to that of a portfolio of lifestyle brands with a direct control model over most of our brands, products and international territories. We believe that this broader and better diversified portfolio mix positions us for ongoing growth, offering our customers a range of products, price points and channels of distribution, and our size and global operations favorably position us to take advantage of synergies in design, sourcing and distribution. In connection with our key objectives, we intend to continue to pursue opportunities for growth during the course of Fiscal 2009 and beyond. These opportunities and continued investment initiatives include: Global expansion of our retail presence in various formats and key markets, including Paris, France; Ongoing integration of our newly acquired Japanese businesses, and the transition of certain key product categories operated under pre existing sublicenses in Japan into our own business; 34 Table of Contents Further development of a wide array of luxury accessories product offerings, including handbags, footwear, small leathergoods and watches/jewelry; and Further growth in our initiatives to develop new lifestyle brands in partnership with select department and specialty stores, such as our current American Living brand with J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCPenney) and our current Chaps brand with Kohls Department Stores, Inc. Global Economic Uncertainty Our opportunities for long term growth are accompanied by significant challenges and risks, particularly in the near term. Specifically, our business is dependent on consumer demand for our products. We believe that significant uncertainty and a slowdown in the U.S. macroeconomic environment negatively impacted the level of consumer spending for discretionary items during most of Fiscal 2008. Despite the more challenging U.S. retail environment that affected both the Companys wholesale customers and retail channels, we continued to experience reported revenue growth for all quarters during Fiscal 2008. If the U.S. macroeconomic environment continues to be weak and or spreads to significant markets outside of the U.S., these worsening economic conditions could have a continuing negative effect on the Companys sales and operating margin growth rates across all segments in Fiscal 2009. As of March 29, 2008, largely in response to the U.S. macroeconomic environment, our traditional retail partners in the U.S. have reduced their initial wholesale orders for fall 2008 apparel products. This contraction in the U.S. department and specialty store channel in Fiscal 2009 is expected to be more than offset primarily by sales in our new American Living product line and by the continuing growth in profitability of our businesses in Europe and Japan. See Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Fiscal 2008 10 K for further discussion. Summary of Financial Performance Operating Results During Fiscal 2008, we reported revenues of $4.880 billion, net income of $419.8 million and net income per diluted share of $3.99. This compares to revenues of $4.295 billion, net income of $400.9 million and net income per diluted share of $3.73 during Fiscal 2007. As discussed further below, the comparability of our operating results has been affected by recent acquisitions and the adoption of the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 109 (FIN 48), effective as of the beginning of Fiscal 2008. On a reported basis, our operating performance in Fiscal 2008 was primarily driven by 13.6% revenue growth, led by our Wholesale and Retail segments (including the effect of certain acquisitions that occurred in the first quarter of Fiscal 2008; see Recent Developments for further discussion). This revenue growth was partially offset by a decline in gross profit percentage of 30 basis points to 54.1% primarily due to the purchase accounting effects of our recent acquisitions, as well as increases in selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses and amortization expense of intangible assets driven by these acquisitions. The increase in SGA expense was also attributable to the overall growth in our business. Excluding the effects of acquisitions, revenues increased by 8.6%, led by our Wholesale segment (8.1% growth) and Retail segment (9.7% growth). Excluding the effects of acquisitions, gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased 10 basis points as improved performance in our European wholesale operations more than offset increased domestic promotional activity associated in part with the challenging U.S. retail environment. Net income and net income per diluted share increased in Fiscal 2008 as compared to Fiscal 2007, principally due to a $20.1 million decrease in the provision for income taxes and an $0.8 million increase in operating income. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was driven by a 310 basis point decline in our effective tax rate. See Transactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition described below for further discussion of the recent acquisitions and the adoption of FIN 48. 35 Table of Contents Financial Condition and Liquidity Our financial position reflects the funding of our recent acquisitions, our increased share repurchase activity and the overall relative strength of our business results. Excluding $74.3 million of short term investments classified in our consolidated balance sheet outside of cash and cash equivalents, we ended Fiscal 2008 in a net debt position (total debt less total cash and cash equivalents) of $127.7 million, compared to a net cash position (total cash and cash equivalents less total debt) of $165.1 million at the end of Fiscal 2007. The decrease in our net cash position as of the end of Fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the Japanese Business Acquisitions (as defined and discussed under Recent Developments), net of approximately $239 million of Impact 21s cash on hand acquired. The decrease is also due to an increase in our share repurchases and capital expenditures. Our stockholders equity increased to $2.390 billion as of March 29, 2008, compared to $2.335 billion as of March 31, 2007. This increase was primarily due to our net income and higher other comprehensive income during Fiscal 2008, offset in part by our increased share repurchase activity and a $62.5 million reduction in retained earnings in connection with the adoption of FIN 48. We generated $695.4 million of cash from operations in Fiscal 2008, compared to $796.1 million in Fiscal 2007. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily driven by the absence of the approximately $180 million, net of certain tax withholdings, received under the Eyewear Licensing Agreement (as defined in Note 22 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements) in the prior fiscal year. We used our cash availability to reinvest in our business through capital spending and acquisitions, as well as in connection with our common stock repurchase program. In particular, we spent $217.1 million for capital expenditures primarily associated with global retail store expansion, construction and renovation of department store shop in shops and investments in our facilities and technological infrastructure. We used $188.7 million primarily to fund the Japanese Business Acquisitions and the Small Leathergoods Business Acquisition, net of cash acquired (see Recent Developments for further discussion). We also used $475.4 million to repurchase 6.0 million shares of Class A common stock. Transactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition The comparability of the Companys operating results for the three fiscal years presented herein has been affected by certain transactions, including: Acquisitions that occurred in Fiscal 2008, Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006. In particular, the Company completed the Japanese Business Acquisitions on May 29, 2007, the Small Leathergoods Business Acquisition on April 13, 2007, the RL Media Minority Interest Acquisition on March 28, 2007, the Polo Jeans Business Acquisition on February 3, 2006 and the Footwear Business Acquisition on July 15, 2005 (each as defined in Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements). The adoption of the provisions of FIN 48 as of the beginning of Fiscal 2008 (April 1, 2007). Accruals required for Fiscal 2008 under the provisions of FIN 48 were entirely offset by the reversal of tax reserves, principally associated with an audit settlement and the expiration of a statute of limitations. The incremental impact of the adoption of FIN 48 decreased the effective tax rate by 97 basis points in Fiscal 2008. See Note 12 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Companys adoption of FIN 48. The change in accounting for stock based compensation effective as of the beginning of Fiscal 2007 (April 2, 2006), as well as certain pretax charges related to retail asset impairments recognized during each of Fiscal 2008 and Fiscal 2006. Certain pretax charges (reversals) related to restructurings and the Companys credit card contingencies during the fiscal years presented. 36 Table of Contents A summary of the effect of certain of these items on pretax income for each applicable fiscal year presented is noted below (references to notes are to the notes to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements): Fiscal Years Ended March 29, March 31, April 1, 2008 2007 2006 (millions) Stock based compensation costs (see Note 18) $ (70.7 ) $ (43.6 ) $ (26.6 ) Restructuring charges (see Note 11) (4.6 ) (9.0 ) Impairments of retail assets (see Note 7) (5.0 ) (10.8 ) Credit card contingency reserve reversals (charges) (see Note 15) 4.1 (3.0 ) (6.8 ) $ (71.6 ) $ (51.2 ) $ (53.2 ) The following discussion of results of operations highlights, as necessary, the significant changes in operating results arising from these items and transactions. However, unusual items or transactions may occur in any period. Accordingly, investors and other financial statement users individually should consider the types of events and transactions that have affected operating trends. Recent Developments Japanese Business Acquisitions On May 29, 2007, the Company completed its previously announced transactions to acquire control of certain of its Japanese businesses that were formerly conducted under licensed arrangements, consistent with the Companys long term strategy of international expansion. In particular, the Company acquired approximately 77% of the outstanding shares of Impact 21 Co., Ltd. (Impact 21) that it did not previously own in a cash tender offer (the Impact 21 Acquisition), thereby increasing its ownership in Impact 21 from approximately 20% to approximately 97%. Impact 21 conducts the Companys mens, womens and jeans apparel and accessories business in Japan under a pre existing, sub license arrangement. In addition, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in Polo Ralph Lauren Japan Corporation (PRL Japan), which holds the master license to conduct Polos business in Japan, from Onward Kashiyama and Seibu (the PRL Japan Minority Interest Acquisition). Collectively, the Impact 21 Acquisition and the PRL Japan Minority Interest Acquisition are herein referred to as the Japanese Business Acquisitions. The purchase price initially paid in connection with the Japanese Business Acquisitions was approximately $360 million, including transaction costs of approximately $12 million. In January 2008, at an Impact 21 shareholders meeting, the Company obtained the necessary approvals to complete the process of acquiring the remaining approximately 3% of outstanding shares not exchanged as of the close of the tender offer period (the minority squeeze out). In February 2008, the Company acquired approximately 1% of the remaining Impact 21 shares outstanding at an aggregate cost of $5 million. The Company expects the minority squeeze out to be successfully concluded in the first quarter of Fiscal 2009, at an estimated aggregate cost of $9 million. The Company funded the Japanese Business Acquisitions with available cash on hand and 20.5 billion of borrowings under a one year term loan agreement pursuant to an amendment and restatement to the Companys existing credit facility. The Company repaid the borrowing by its maturity date on May 22, 2008 using approximately $200 million of Impact 21s cash on hand acquired as part of the acquisition. The results of operations for Impact 21, which were previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting, have been consolidated in the Companys results of operations commencing April 1, 2007. Accordingly, the Company recorded within minority interest expense the amount of Impact 21s net income allocable to the holders of the approximate 80% of the Impact 21 shares not owned by the Company prior to the closing date of the tender offer. The results of operations for PRL Japan have already been consolidated by the Company as described further in Note 2 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements. 37 Table of Contents Acquisition of Small Leathergoods Business On April 13, 2007, the Company acquired from Kellwood Company (Kellwood) substantially all of the assets of New Campaign, Inc., the Companys licensee for mens and womens belts and other small leather goods under the Ralph Lauren, Lauren and Chaps brands in the U.S. (the Small Leathergoods Business Acquisition). The assets acquired from Kellwood are operated under the name of Polo Ralph Lauren Leathergoods and allowed the Company to further expand its accessories business. The acquisition cost was approximately $10 million. Kellwood provided various transition services to the Company for a period of up to six months from the date of acquisition. The results of operations for the Polo Ralph Lauren Leathergoods business have been consolidated in the Companys results of operations commencing April 1, 2007. Acquisition of RL Media Minority Interest On March 28, 2007, the Company acquired the remaining 50% equity interest in Ralph Lauren Media, LLC (RL Media) formerly held by NBC Lauren Media Holdings, Inc., a subsidiary wholly owned by the National Broadcasting Company, Inc. (NBC) (37.5%) and Value Vision Media, Inc. (Value Vision) (12.5%) (the RL Media Minority Interest Acquisition). RL Media conducts the Companys e commerce initiatives through the RalphLauren.com internet site and is consolidated by the Company as a wholly owned subsidiary. The acquisition cost was $175 million. In addition, Value Vision entered into a transition services agreement with the Company to provide order fulfillment and related services over a period of up to seventeen months from the date of the acquisition of the RL Media minority interest. American Living In Fiscal 2008, the Company launched American Living, a new lifestyle brand created exclusively in the U.S. for distribution by JCPenney through the Companys new Global Brand Concepts (GBC) group. The Company began shipping related product to JCPenney in December 2007 to support the launch of this new product line. The success of American Living and the introduction of new product categories in both the U.S. and overseas may be negatively impacted in Fiscal 2009 by ongoing economic uncertainty. See Global Economic Uncertainty for further discussion. Other Developments In late Fiscal 2007, the Company formed the Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Company, S.A.R.L. (the RL Watch Company), a joint venture with Financiere Richemont SA (Richemont), the Swiss Luxury Goods Group. The Company began to incur certain start up costs in Fiscal 2008 to support the launch of this business, which is expected to occur in the spring of calendar 2009. See Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Companys acquisitions and joint venture formed during the fiscal years presented. 38 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 The following table summarizes our results of operations and expresses the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain financial statement captions: Fiscal Years Ended March 29, March 31, 2008 2007 $ Change % Change (millions, except per share data) Net revenues $ 4,880.1 $ 4,295.4 $ 584.7 13.6 % Cost of goods sold(a) (2,242.0 ) (1,959.2 ) (282.8 ) 14.4 % Gross profit 2,638.1 2,336.2 301.9 12.9 % Gross profit as % of net revenues 54.1 % 54.4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses(a) (1,932.5 ) (1,663.4 ) (269.1 ) 16.2 % SGA as % of net revenues 39.6 % 38.7 % Amortization of intangible assets (47.2 ) (15.6 ) (31.6 ) 202.6 % Impairment of retail assets (5.0 ) (5.0 ) NM Restructuring charges (4.6 ) 4.6 (100.0 )% Operating income 653.4 652.6 0.8 0.1 % Operating income as % of net revenues 13.4 % 15.2 % Foreign currency gains (losses) (6.4 ) (1.5 ) (4.9 ) 326.7 % Interest expense (25.7 ) (21.6 ) (4.1 ) 19.0 % Interest and other income, net 24.7 26.1 (1.4 ) (5.4 )% Equity in income (loss) of equity method investees (1.8 ) 3.0 (4.8 ) (160.0 )% Minority interest expense (2.1 ) (15.3 ) 13.2 (86.3 )% Income before provision for income taxes 642.1 643.3 (1.2 ) (0.2 )% Provision for income taxes (222.3 ) (242.4 ) 20.1 (8.3 )% Effective tax rate(b) 34.6 % 37.7 % Net income $ 419.8 $ 400.9 $ 18.9 4.7 % Net income per share Basic $ 4.10 $ 3.84 $ 0.26 6.8 % Net income per share Diluted $ 3.99 $ 3.73 $ 0.26 7.0 % (a) Includes total depreciation expense of $154.1 million and $129.1 million for Fiscal 2008 and Fiscal 2007, respectively. (b) Effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before provision for income taxes. NM Not meaningful. Net Revenues. Net revenues increased by $584.7 million, or 13.6%, to $4.880 billion in Fiscal 2008 from $4.295 billion in Fiscal 2007. The increase was driven by a combination of organic growth, acquisitions and favorable foreign currency effects. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, net revenues increased by $371.2 million, or 8.6%. On a reported basis, wholesale revenues increased by $442.2 million primarily as a result of incremental revenues from the newly acquired Impact 21 and Small Leathergoods businesses, the inclusion of revenues from the initial shipments of the American Living product line to JCPenney and increased sales in our global menswear and womenswear product lines, primarily driven by strong performance in Europe. The increase in net revenues also was driven by an increase of $169.4 million in our Retail segment revenues as a result of an increase in comparable global retail store sales, continued global store expansion and growth in RalphLauren.com sales. The increase in net 39 Table of Contents revenues was partially offset by a decrease of $26.9 million in licensing revenue, primarily due to a decrease in international licensing royalties as a result of the loss of licensing revenues from Impact 21, which is now consolidated as part of the Wholesale segment. Also contributing to the decrease in licensing revenue was a net decrease in domestic licensing royalties, primarily due to the absence of approximately $8 million of minimum royalty and design service fees received in connection with the termination of a licensing arrangement in the prior fiscal year. Net revenues for our three business segments are provided below: Fiscal Years Ended March 29, March 31, 2008 2007 $ Change % Change (millions) Net Revenues: Wholesale $ 2,758.1 $ 2,315.9 $ 442.2 19.1 % Retail 1,912.6 1,743.2 169.4 9.7 % Licensing 209.4 236.3 (26.9 ) (11.4 )% Total net revenues $ 4,880.1 $ 4,295.4 $ 584.7 13.6 % Wholesale net revenues The net increase primarily reflects: the inclusion of $254 million of revenues from the newly acquired Impact 21 and Small Leathergoods businesses, net of intercompany eliminations; an approximate $47 million increase in our European businesses on a constant currency basis driven by increased sales in our menswear and womenswear product lines; an aggregate $81 million net increase in our U.S. businesses. The net increase was primarily due to the initial shipments of the American Living product line to JCPenney; an increase in our menswear shipments; a net increase in womenswear, primarily driven by Chaps, partially offset by increased promotional activity; and an increase in footwear attributable to increased door penetration. Offsetting these increases were a decline in our childrenswear product lines due to weaker sales at department stores and increased promotional activity; and a planned reduction in our off price channel denim business; and a $60 million increase in revenues due to a favorable foreign currency effect, primarily related to the continued strengthening of the Euro in comparison to the U.S. dollar in Fiscal 2008. Retail net revenues For purposes of the discussion of retail operating performance below, we refer to the measure comparable store sales. Comparable store sales refer to the growth of sales in stores that are open for at least one full fiscal year. Sales for stores that are closing during a fiscal year are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. Sales for stores that are either relocated, enlarged (as defined by gross square footage expansion of 25% or greater) or closed for 30 or more consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales until such stores have been in their location or in a newly renovated state for at least one full fiscal year. Comparable store sales information includes both Ralph Lauren and Club Monaco stores. 40 Table of Contents The increase in retail net revenues primarily reflects: a $87 million aggregate net increase in comparable full price and factory store sales on a global basis, including a net aggregate favorable $22 million foreign currency effect. This net increase was driven by increases in comparable store sales as provided below: Fiscal Year Ended March 29, 2008 Increases in comparable store sales as reported: Full price Ralph Lauren store sales 6.6 % Full price Club Monaco store sales 5.7 % Factory store sales 5.5 % Total increase in comparable store sales as reported 5.8 % Increases in comparable store sales excluding the effect of foreign currency: Full price Ralph Lauren store sales 4.3 % Full price Club Monaco store sales 5.7 % Factory store sales 4.2 % Total increase in comparable store sales excluding the effect of foreign currency 4.3 % a $52 million aggregate net increase in sales from non comparable stores, primarily relating to new store openings within the past fiscal year. There was a net increase in average global store count of 9 stores, to a total of 313 stores, compared to the prior fiscal year. The net increase in store count was primarily due to several new domestic and international full price and factory store openings; and a $30 million, or 26.4%, increase in sales at RalphLauren.com. Licensing revenue The net decrease primarily reflects: a $26 million net decrease in international licensing royalties, primarily due to the loss of licensing revenues from Impact 21, which is now consolidated as part of the Wholesale segment; and a $1 million net decrease in domestic licensing royalties, primarily due to the absence of approximately $8 million of minimum royalty and design service fees received in connection with the termination of a licensing arrangement in the prior fiscal year. The net decrease was partially offset by an increase in eyewear related royalties as a result of the licensing agreement entered into with Luxottica, which took effect on January 1, 2007. Gross Profit. Cost of goods sold includes the expenses incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale, including product costs, freight in, and import costs, as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory obsolescence. The costs of selling merchandise, including preparing the merchandise for sale, such as picking, packing, warehousing and order charges, are included in SGA expenses. Gross profit increased by $301.9 million, or 12.9%, to $2.638 billion in Fiscal 2008 from $2.336 billion in Fiscal 2007. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased by 30 basis points to 54.1% in Fiscal 2008 from 54.4% in Fiscal 2007, primarily due to the dilutive effect of our recent acquisitions. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, gross profit increased by $208.6 million, or 8.9%, and gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased 10 basis points compared to Fiscal 2007. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was due to improved performance in our European wholesale operations which generally carry higher margins, offset in part by increased domestic promotional activity as well as a slight change in the overall relative sales mix between the Wholesale segment and the higher margin Retail and Licensing segments. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in material costs. These factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year. 41 Table of Contents We anticipate that current macroeconomic challenges, including inflationary pressures on raw material and fuel costs, could negatively affect the cost of our products and related gross profit percentages in Fiscal 2009. See Item 1A Risk Factors for further discussion. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SGA expenses primarily include compensation and benefits, marketing, distribution, information technology, facilities, legal and other costs associated with finance and administration. SGA expenses increased by $269.1 million, or 16.2%, to $1.932 billion in Fiscal 2008 from $1.663 billion in Fiscal 2007. SGA expenses as a percent of net revenues increased to 39.6% in Fiscal 2008 from 38.7% in Fiscal 2007. The net 90 basis point increase was primarily associated with operating expenses at the Companys newly acquired businesses and certain start up costs related to new business launches. The $269.1 million increase in SGA expenses was primarily driven by: the inclusion of SGA costs of approximately $91 million for our newly acquired Impact 21 and Small Leathergoods businesses, including costs incurred pursuant to transition service arrangements; higher stock based compensation expense of approximately $27 million primarily due to an increase in the Companys share price as of the date of its annual equity award grant in the second quarter of Fiscal 2008 compared to the share price as of the comparable grant date in Fiscal 2007; higher compensation related expenses (excluding stock based compensation) of approximately $56 million, principally relating to increased selling costs associated with higher retail and wholesale sales and our ongoing product line expansion, including American Living and a dedicated dress business across multiple brands, as well as severance related costs; an approximate $39 million increase in rent and utility costs to support the ongoing global growth of our businesses, including rent expense related to certain retail stores scheduled to open in Fiscal 2009; an approximate $25 million increase in depreciation expense primarily associated with global retail store expansion, construction and renovation of department store shop in shops and investments in our facilities and technological infrastructure; and an approximate $36 million increase in SGA expenses due to unfavorable foreign currency effects, primarily related to the continued strengthening of the Euro in comparison to the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2008. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets increased by $31.6 million, to $47.2 million in Fiscal 2008 from $15.6 million in Fiscal 2007. The net increase was primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with the Companys recent acquisitions. See Recent Developments for further discussion of the acquisitions. Impairment of Retail Assets. A non cash impairment charge of $5.0 million was recognized in Fiscal 2008 to reduce the carrying value of certain long lived assets in the Companys Retail segment to their estimated fair value. The impairment was primarily attributable to lower than expected operating cash flow performance in certain stores. No impairment charges were recognized in Fiscal 2007. See Note 7 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Restructuring Charges. Restructuring charges of $4.6 million were recognized in Fiscal 2007 primarily associated with the Club Monaco retail business. No significant restructuring charges were recognized in Fiscal 2008. See Note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Operating Income. Operating income increased slightly by $0.8 million, or 0.1%, to $653.4 million in Fiscal 2008 from $652.6 million in Fiscal 2007. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased 180 basis points, to 13.4% in Fiscal 2008 from 15.2% in Fiscal 2007, primarily due to the effect of purchase accounting relating to the acquisitions. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, operating income increased by $43.0 million, or 6.6%, while operating income as a percentage of net revenues decreased 30 basis points in Fiscal 2008. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net revenues primarily reflected the increase in SGA expenses due to business expansion, partially offset by an increase in gross profit margin as previously discussed. 42 Table of Contents Operating income as reported for our three business segments is provided below: Fiscal Years Ended March 29, March 31, 2008 2007 $ Change % Change (millions) Operating Income: Wholesale $ 565.4 $ 477.8 $ 87.6 18.3 % Retail 204.2 224.2 (20.0 ) (8.9 )% Licensing 96.7 141.6 (44.9 ) (31.7 )% 866.3 843.6 22.7 2.7 % Less: Unallocated corporate expenses (217.0 ) (183.4 ) (33.6 ) 18.3 % Unallocated legal and restructuring charges 4.1 (7.6 ) 11.7 (153.9 )% Total operating income $ 653.4 $ 652.6 $ 0.8 0.1 % Wholesale operating income increased by $87.6 million, including the favorable effects from the Japanese Business and Small Leathergoods Business Acquisitions. Excluding the effects of these acquisitions, wholesale operating income increased by $61.4 million primarily as a result of increased net sales, including shipments of American Living, and improved gross margin primarily in our European wholesale operations, offset in part by increased domestic promotional activity in certain product categories. The increase was partially offset by higher net SGA expenses in support of our new product lines. Retail operating income decreased by $20.0 million, including the unfavorable effects from purchase accounting related to the RL Media Minority Interest Acquisition. Excluding the effects of the acquisition, retail operating income decreased by $9.0 million primarily as a result of increased markdown activity, a non cash impairment charge of $5.0 million, and an increase in occupancy and other operating costs principally related to worldwide store expansion, as we continue to develop and invest in our existing retail concepts and formats. The decrease also reflected an increase in selling related salaries and associated costs, as well as increased fulfillment costs associated with higher sales at RalphLauren.com. Licensing operating income decreased by $44.9 million, including the unfavorable effects from the Japanese Business and Small Leathergoods Business Acquisitions. Excluding the effects of these acquisitions, licensing operating income increased by $12.5 million primarily due to an increase in eyewear related royalties. This increase was partially offset by the absence of approximately $8 million of minimum royalty and design service fees received in connection with the termination of a licensing arrangement in the prior fiscal year. Unallocated corporate expenses increased by $33.6 million, primarily as a result of increases in brand related marketing costs, including costs associated with various events related to the Companys 40th anniversary, and compensation related and facilities costs to support the ongoing growth of our businesses. The increase in compensation related costs includes higher stock based compensation expense and severance related costs, as previously discussed under SGA expenses. Unallocated legal and restructuring charges were comprised of a reversal of an excess reserve in the amount of $4.1 million in Fiscal 2008 related to the Credit Card Matters (as defined in Note 15 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements). Unallocated legal and restructuring charges were $7.6 million in Fiscal 2007 and were principally associated with the Club Monaco Restructuring Plan charges of $4.0 million (as defined in Note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements) and costs of $3.0 million related to the Credit Card Matters. No significant unallocated legal and restructuring charges were recognized in Fiscal 2008. Foreign Currency Gains (Losses). The effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss of $6.4 million in Fiscal 2008, compared to a loss of $1.5 million in Fiscal 2007. Foreign currency losses increased compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to a $2.0 million write off of foreign currency option contracts, entered into to manage certain foreign currency exposures associated with the Japanese Business Acquisitions, most of which have expired unexercised as of March 29, 2008, hedge activity associated with the return of capital from a foreign subsidiary and intercompany royalty activity, as well as the timing of the settlement of third party and 43 Table of Contents intercompany receivables and payables (that were not of a long term investment nature). Foreign currency gains and losses are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. Interest Expense. Interest expense includes the borrowing costs of our outstanding debt, including amortization of debt issuance costs. Interest expense increased by $4.1 million to $25.7 million in Fiscal 2008 from $21.6 million in Fiscal 2007. The increase is primarily due to additional borrowings undertaken during the first quarter of Fiscal 2008 in connection with the Japanese Business Acquisitions (see Debt and Covenant Compliance for further discussion), as well as the higher principal amount of our outstanding Euro denominated debt. This increase was partially offset by the absence of overlapping interest on debt during the period between the issuance of the 2006 Euro Debt and the repayment of approximate 227 million principal amount of 6.125% notes outstanding that were due on November 22, 2006, from an original issuance of 275 million in 1999 (the 1999 Euro Debt), in the prior fiscal year. Interest and Other Income, net. Interest and other income, net, decreased by $1.4 million, to $24.7 million in Fiscal 2008 from $26.1 million in Fiscal 2007. This decrease was principally driven by lower average interest rates, lower balances on our invested excess cash and higher transaction related costs. Equity in Income (Loss) of Equity Method Investees. The equity in loss of equity method investees of $1.8 million in Fiscal 2008 related to certain start up costs associated with the recently formed joint venture, RL Watch Company, which the Company accounts for under the equity method of accounting. The equity in income of equity method investees of $3.0 million in Fiscal 2007 related to Impact 21, which was previously accounted for as an equity method investment. The results of operations for Impact 21 have been consolidated in the Companys results of operations commencing April 1, 2007. Accordingly, no equity income related to Impact 21 was recorded in Fiscal 2008. See Recent Developments for further discussion of the Companys Impact 21 Acquisition. Minority Interest Expense. Minority interest expense decreased by $13.2 million, to $2.1 million in Fiscal 2008 from $15.3 million in Fiscal 2007. The decrease is related to the Companys acquisition of the remaining 50% interests in RL Media and PRL Japan. This decrease was partially offset by an increase related to the allocation of Impact 21s net income to the holders of the approximate 80% interest not owned by the Company prior to the closing date of the related tender offer and to the holders of the remaining approximate 3% interest not owned by the Company as of the end of Fiscal 2008. See Recent Developments for further discussion of the Companys acquisitions. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased by $20.1 million, or 8.3%, to $222.3 million in Fiscal 2008 from $242.4 million in Fiscal 2007. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our reported effective tax rate of 310 basis points, to 34.6% in Fiscal 2008 from 37.7% in Fiscal 2007, and a decrease in pretax income in Fiscal 2008 compared to Fiscal 2007. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to tax reserve reductions associated with an audit settlement and the expiration of a statute of limitations, lower state income taxes as well as a change in the geographic mix of earnings, partially offset by certain higher, non deductible expenses under 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The effective tax rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses. Our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on non recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and amount of foreign dividends, enacted tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax audit findings and settlements, and the interaction of various global tax strategies. See Critical Accounting Policies for a discussion on the accounting for uncertain tax positions and the Companys adoption of FIN 48 as of the beginning of Fiscal 2008. Net Income. Net income increased by $18.9 million, or 4.7%, to $419.8 million in Fiscal 2008 from $400.9 million in Fiscal 2007. The increase in net income principally related to the $20.1 million decrease in provision for income taxes discussed above and the $0.8 million increase in operating income. The increase was partially offset by reductions in operating income primarily related to the dilutive effect of purchase accounting, an increase in domestic promotional activity and higher SGA expenses principally associated with our recent acquisitions. The net dilutive effect related to the Companys recent acquisitions included approximately $53 million of non cash amortization of intangible assets and inventory. See Recent Developments for further discussion of the Companys acquisitions. 44 Table of Contents Net Income Per Diluted Share. Net income per diluted share increased by $0.26, or 7.0%, to $3.99 per share in Fiscal 2008 from $3.73 per share in Fiscal 2007. The increase in diluted per share results was primarily due to the higher level of net income and lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding for Fiscal 2008 compared to the prior fiscal year. Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 The following table summarizes our results of operations and expresses the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain financial statement captions: Fiscal Years Ended March 31, April 1, 2007 2006 $ Change % Change (millions, except per share data) Net revenues $ 4,295.4 $ 3,746.3 $ 549.1 14.7 % Cost of goods sold(a) (1,959.2 ) (1,723.9 ) (235.3 ) 13.7 % Gross profit 2,336.2 2,022.4 313.8 15.5 % Gross profit as % of net revenues 54.4 % 54.0 % Selling, general and administrative expenses(a) (1,663.4 ) (1,476.9 ) (186.5 ) 12.6 % SGA as % of net revenues 38.7 % 39.4 % Amortization of intangible assets (15.6 ) (9.1 ) (6.5 ) 71.4 % Impairment of retail assets (10.8 ) 10.8 (100.0 )% Restructuring charges (4.6 ) (9.0 ) 4.4 (48.9 )% Operating income 652.6 516.6 136.0 26.3 % Operating income as % of net revenues 15.2 % 13.8 % Foreign currency gains (losses) (1.5 ) (5.7 ) 4.2 (73.7 )% Interest expense (21.6 ) (12.5 ) (9.1 ) 72.8 % Interest and other income, net 26.1 13.7 12.4 90.5 % Equity in income (loss) of equity method investees 3.0 4.3 (1.3 ) (30.2 )% Minority interest expense (15.3 ) (13.5 ) (1.8 ) 13.3 % Income before provision for income taxes 643.3 502.9 140.4 27.9 % Provision for income taxes (242.4 ) (194.9 ) (47.5 ) 24.4 % Effective tax rate(b) 37.7 % 38.8 % Net income $ 400.9 $ 308.0 $ 92.9 30.2 % Net income per share Basic $ 3.84 $ 2.96 $ 0.88 29.7 % Net income per share Diluted $ 3.73 $ 2.87 $ 0.86 30.0 % (a) Includes total depreciation expense of $129.1 million and $117.9 million for Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006, respectively. (b) Effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before provision for income taxes. 45 Table of Contents Net Revenues. Net revenues increased by $549.1 million, or 14.7%, to $4.295 billion in Fiscal 2007 from $3.746 billion in Fiscal 2006. The increase was experienced in all geographic regions and was due to a combination of organic growth and acquisitions. Wholesale revenues increased by $373.4 million, primarily as a result of revenues from the newly acquired Polo Jeans Business, the successful launch of the new Chaps for women and children product lines, and increased sales in our global menswear and womenswear product lines. The increase in net revenues also was driven by a revenue increase of $184.6 million in our Retail segment as a result of improved comparable global retail store sales, continued store expansion and growth in RalphLauren.com sales. Licensing revenue decreased by $8.9 million primarily due to the loss of product licensing revenue related to the Polo Jeans and Footwear Businesses (now included as part of the Wholesale segment). Net revenues for our three business segments are provided below: Fiscal Years Ended March 31, April 1, 2007 2006 $ Change % Change (millions) Net Revenues: Wholesale $ 2,315.9 $ 1,942.5 $ 373.4 19.2 % Retail 1,743.2 1,558.6 184.6 11.8 % Licensing 236.3 245.2 (8.9 ) (3.6 )% Total net revenues $ 4,295.4 $ 3,746.3 $ 549.1 14.7 % Wholesale net revenues the net increase primarily reflects: the inclusion of $190 million of revenues from our newly acquired Footwear and Polo Jeans Businesses; a $156 million aggregate net increase led by our global menswear, womenswear and childrenswear businesses, primarily driven by strong growth in our Lauren product line, increased full price sell through performance in our menswear business and the effects from the successful domestic launch of our new Chaps for women and children product lines. These increases were partially offset by a decline in footwear sales (excluding the impact from acquisition) due to our planned integration efforts as we repositioned the related product line; and a $27 million increase in revenues due to a favorable foreign currency effect, primarily related to the strengthening of the Euro in comparison to the U.S. dollar in Fiscal 2007. Retail net revenues The net increase primarily reflects: a $104 million aggregate net increase in comparable full price and factory store sales on a global basis, including a net aggregate favorable $9 million foreign currency effect. This net increase was driven by increases in comparable store sales as provided below: Fiscal Year Ended March 31, 2007 Increases in comparable store sales as reported: Full price Ralph Lauren store sales 6.6 % Full price Club Monaco store sales 10.9 % Factory store sales 8.1 % Total increase in comparable store sales as reported 7.6 % Increases in comparable store sales excluding the effect of foreign currency: Full price Ralph Lauren store sales 5.7 % Full price Club Monaco store sales 10.9 % Factory store sales 7.5 % Total increase in comparable store sales excluding the effect of foreign currency 6.9 % 46 Table of Contents an increase in sales from non comparable stores, primarily relating to new store openings within the past fiscal year. There was a net increase in global store count of 3 stores compared to the prior fiscal year, to a total of 292 stores. The net increase in store count was primarily due to several new openings of full price stores, partially offset by the closure of certain Club Monaco Caban Concept and factory stores and Polo Jeans factory stores; and a $26 million, or 28.9%, increase in sales at RalphLauren.com. Licensing revenue the net decrease primarily reflects: the loss of licensing revenues from our Polo Jeans and Footwear Businesses now included as part of the Wholesale segment; a decline in eyewear related royalties due to the wind down of the Companys pre existing licensing agreement prior to the commencement of the new Eyewear Licensing Agreement which took effect on January 1, 2007; a decline in Home licensing royalties; and a partially offsetting increase in international licensing royalties and the accelerated receipt and recognition of approximately $8 million of minimum royalty and design service fees in connection with the termination of a domestic license agreement during Fiscal 2007. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased by $313.8 million, or 15.5%, to $2.336 billion in Fiscal 2007 from $2.022 billion in Fiscal 2006. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues also increased to 54.4% in Fiscal 2007 from 54.0% in Fiscal 2006. The increase in gross profit reflected higher net sales and improved merchandise margins in our wholesale and retail businesses, including the continued emphasis on shifting the mix from off price to full price sales across our wholesale product lines, as well as the focus on improved inventory management. However, the overall improvement in gross profit margins was partially offset by the lower gross profit performance of our newly acquired Polo Jeans Business associated with the liquidation of existing inventory in anticipation of the redesign and launch of our new denim and casual sportswear product lines during spring of calendar 2007. Gross profit margins related to our Footwear Business have also been negatively impacted during Fiscal 2007, primarily by integration efforts as we repositioned the related product line. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SGA expenses increased by $186.5 million, or 12.6%, to $1.663 billion in Fiscal 2007 from $1.477 billion in Fiscal 2006. SGA expenses as a percent of net revenues decreased to 38.7% in Fiscal 2007 from 39.4% in Fiscal 2006. The 70 basis point improvement is primarily indicative of our ability to successfully leverage our global infrastructure as we acquire businesses and grow product lines organically. The $186.5 million net increase in SGA expenses was primarily driven by: higher compensation related expenses (excluding stock based compensation) of approximately $69 million, principally relating to increased selling costs associated with higher retail sales and our ongoing worldwide retail store and product line expansion, and higher investment in infrastructure to support the ongoing growth of our businesses; the inclusion of SGA costs for our newly acquired Footwear and Polo Jeans Businesses, including costs incurred pursuant to transition service arrangements; a $38 million increase in brand related marketing and facilities costs to support the ongoing growth of our businesses; an approximate $10 million increase in depreciation costs in connection with our increased capital expenditures and global expansion; incremental stock based compensation expense of approximately $17 million as a result of the adoption of FAS 123R as of April 2, 2006 (see Note 18 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion); and a net reduction in credit card contingency charges of approximately $4 million. 47 Table of Contents Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets increased by $6.5 million, to $15.6 million in Fiscal 2007 from $9.1 million in Fiscal 2006. The increase was due to the amortization of intangible assets related to the Polo Jeans Business acquired in February 2006 and the Footwear Business acquired in July 2005. Impairment of Retail Assets. A non cash impairment charge of $10.8 million was recognized during Fiscal 2006 to reduce the carrying value of fixed assets largely relating to our Club Monaco brand. No impairment charges were recognized in Fiscal 2007. Restructuring Charges. Restructuring charges decreased by $4.4 million, to $4.6 million in Fiscal 2007 from $9.0 million in Fiscal 2006. Restructuring charges recognized in both periods were principally associated with the Club Monaco retail business. See Note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Operating Income. Operating income increased by $136.0 million, or 26.3%, to $652.6 million in Fiscal 2007 from $516.6 million in Fiscal 2006. Operating income as a percentage of revenue increased 140 basis points, to 15.2% in Fiscal 2007 from 13.8% in Fiscal 2006, reflecting our revenue growth, gross profit percentage expansion and improved SGA expense leveraging. Operating income for our three business segments is provided below: Fiscal Years Ended March 31, April 1, 2007 2006 $ Change % Change (millions) Operating Income: Wholesale $ 477.8 $ 398.3 $ 79.5 20.0 % Retail 224.2 140.0 84.2 60.1 % Licensing 141.6 153.5 (11.9 ) (7.8 )% 843.6 691.8 151.8 21.9 % Less: Unallocated corporate expenses (183.4 ) (159.1 ) (24.3 ) 15.3 % Unallocated legal and restructuring charges (7.6 ) (16.1 ) 8.5 (52.8 )% Total operating income $ 652.6 $ 516.6 $ 136.0 26.3 % Wholesale operating income increased by $79.5 million, primarily as a result of higher net sales and improved gross margin rates in most product lines, as well as the incremental contribution from the newly acquired Polo Jeans Business and the new Chaps product lines. These increases were partially offset by increases in SGA expenses in support of new product lines across all geographic territories and higher amortization expenses associated with intangible assets recognized in acquisitions. Retail operating income increased by $84.2 million, primarily as a result of increased net sales and improved gross margin rates, as well as the absence of a non cash impairment charge of $10.8 million recognized in Fiscal 2006. These increases were partially offset by an increase in selling related salaries and associated costs in connection with the increase in retail sales, including RalphLauren.com, and worldwide store expansion, including the new Tokyo flagship store. Licensing operating income decreased by $11.9 million primarily due to the loss of royalty income formerly collected in connection with the Footwear and Polo Jeans Businesses, which have now been acquired. The decline in Home royalties also contributed to the decrease along with the decline in eyewear royalties, due to the wind down of the Companys pre existing licensing agreement. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in international royalties, as well as the accelerated receipt and recognition of approximately $8 million of minimum royalty and design service fees in connection with the termination of a domestic license agreement during Fiscal 2007. Unallocated corporate expenses increased by $24.3 million, primarily as a result of increases in brand related marketing, payroll related and facilities costs to support the ongoing growth of our businesses. The increase in compensation related costs includes higher stock based compensation expense due to the adoption of FAS 123R (as further discussed in Note 18 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements). 48 Table of Contents Unallocated legal and restructuring charges were $7.6 million during Fiscal 2007, compared to $16.1 million during Fiscal 2006. Fiscal 2007 charges were principally associated with the Club Monaco Restructuring Plan charges of $4.0 million (as defined in Note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements) and legal costs of $3.0 million related to the Credit Card Matters (as defined in Note 15 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements). Fiscal 2006 charges also primarily included the Club Monaco Restructuring Plan charges of $9.0 million and legal costs of $6.8 million associated with the Credit Card Matters. Foreign Currency Gains (Losses). The effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss of $1.5 million in Fiscal 2007, compared to a loss of $5.7 million in Fiscal 2006. The decrease in foreign currency losses compared to the prior fiscal year is due to the timing of the settlement of intercompany receivables and payables (that were not of a long term investment nature) between certain of our international and domestic subsidiaries. Interest Expense. Interest expense increased by $9.1 million to $21.6 million in Fiscal 2007 from $12.5 million in Fiscal 2006. The increase is primarily due to an increase in interest on capitalized leases due to additional obligations in Fiscal 2007 compared to the prior fiscal year and overlapping interest on debt during the period between the issuance of the 2006 Euro Debt and the repayment of the 1999 Euro Debt. In addition, prior year interest expense was favorably impacted by the interest rate swap agreements which were terminated at the end of Fiscal 2006. Interest and Other Income, net. Interest and other income, net, increased by $12.4 million, to $26.1 million in Fiscal 2007 from $13.7 million in Fiscal 2006. This increase is primarily driven by higher average interest rates and higher balances on our invested excess cash. Equity in Income (Loss) of Equity Method Investees. Equity in the income of equity method investees decreased by $1.3 million, to $3.0 million in Fiscal 2007 from $4.3 million in Fiscal 2006. This income relates to our 20% investment in Impact 21, a company that holds the sublicense with PRL Japan for our mens, womens and jeans businesses in Japan. See Recent Developments for further discussion of the Companys Japanese Business Acquisitions that occurred in May 2007. Minority Interest Expense. Minority interest expense increased by $1.8 million, to $15.3 million in Fiscal 2007 from $13.5 million in Fiscal 2006. The net increase is primarily related to the improved operating performance of RL Media compared to the prior period and the associated allocation of income to the minority partners. As of March 28, 2007, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in RL Media held by the minority partners (see Recent Developments for further discussion). Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by $47.5 million, or 24.4%, to $242.4 million in Fiscal 2007 from $194.9 million in Fiscal 2006. This increase is a result of the increase in our pretax income, partially offset by a decrease in our reported effective tax rate, to 37.7% in Fiscal 2007 from 38.8% in Fiscal 2006. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to a change in the mix of earnings, which resulted in more income being taxed at lower rates than in the previous fiscal year. See Critical Accounting Policies for a discussion on the accounting for uncertain tax positions and the Companys adoption of FIN 48 in Fiscal 2008. Net Income. Net income increased by $92.9 million, or 30.2%, to $400.9 million in Fiscal 2007 from $308.0 million in Fiscal 2006. The increase in net income principally related to our $136.0 million increase in operating income, as previously discussed, offset in part by an increase of $47.5 million in our provision for income taxes. Net Income Per Diluted Share. Net income per diluted share increased by $0.86, or 30.0%, to $3.73 per share in Fiscal 2007 from $2.87 per share in Fiscal 2006. The increase in diluted per share results was primarily due to the higher level of net income, partially offset by higher weighted average diluted shares outstanding for Fiscal 2007. 49 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Financial Condition March 29, March 31, 2008 2007 $ Change (millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 551.5 $ 563.9 $ (12.4 ) Current maturities of debt (206.4 ) (206.4 ) Long term debt (472.8 ) (398.8 ) (74.0 ) Net cash (debt)(a) $ (127.7 ) $ 165.1 $ (292.8 ) Short term investments $ 74.3 $ $ 74.3 Stockholders equity $ 2,389.7 $ 2,334.9 $ 54.8 (a) Net cash is defined as total cash and cash equivalents less total debt and net debt is defined as total debt less total cash and cash equivalents. The decrease in our net cash position as of the end of Fiscal 2008 was primarily due to the Japanese Business Acquisitions, net of approximately $239 million of Impact 21s cash on hand acquired. As part of the Japanese Business Acquisitions, the Company borrowed 20.5 billion (approximately $206 million as of March 29, 2008) under a one year term loan agreement pursuant to an amendment and restatement to the Companys existing credit facility. The Company used the proceeds from these borrowings and available cash on hand to fund the Japanese Business Acquisitions. In addition, the Company spent $217.1 million for capital expenditures and used $475.4 million to repurchase 6.0 million shares of Class A common stock. The increase in stockholders equity was primarily due to the Companys net income and higher other comprehensive income during Fiscal 2008, offset in part by an increase in treasury stock as a result of the Companys common stock repurchase program and a reduction in retained earnings of $62.5 million in connection with the adoption of FIN 48. Subsequent to year end, the Company repaid its current maturities of debt using available cash on hand. Cash Flows Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Fiscal Years Ended March 29, March 31, 2008 2007 $ Change (millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 695.4 $ 796.1 $ (100.7 ) Net cash used in investing activities (505.0 ) (434.6 ) (70.4 ) Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (260.5 ) (95.2 ) (165.3 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 57.7 11.9 45.8 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (12.4 ) $ 278.2 $ (290.6 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $695.4 million in Fiscal 2008, compared to $796.1 million in Fiscal 2007. This $100.7 million net decrease in operating cash flow was primarily driven by: the absence of the approximately $180 million, net of certain tax withholdings, received under the Eyewear Licensing Agreement in the prior fiscal year; and an increase in other receivables primarily attributable to the timing of estimated tax payments. 50 Table of Contents The above decreases were partially offset by: an increase in net income before non cash depreciation, amortization and stock based compensation expenses; improved accounts receivable cash collections in the Companys Wholesale segment; and the effects of ongoing inventory management, which resulted in lower average balance and increased inventory turns across certain businesses. Other than the items described above, the changes in operating assets and liabilities were attributable to normal operating fluctuations. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $505.0 million in Fiscal 2008, as compared to $434.6 million in Fiscal 2007. The net increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by: an increase in net cash used to fund the Companys acquisitions. In Fiscal 2008, the Company used $188.7 million principally to fund the Japanese Business Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and the Small Leathergoods Business Acquisition; whereas in Fiscal 2007, $176.1 million was used primarily to fund the RL Media Minority Interest Acquisition; an increase in cash used in connection with capital expenditures. In Fiscal 2008, the Company spent $217.1 million for capital expenditures, as compared to $184.0 million in Fiscal 2007. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily associated with global retail store expansion, construction and renovation of department store shop in shops and investments in our facilities and technological infrastructure, including showrooms related to our new businesses; an increase related to purchases of investments of $96.8 million, less proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $12.7 million, in Fiscal 2008; and a partially offsetting decrease in cash deposits restricted in connection with taxes. During Fiscal 2008, $15.1 million of cash was restricted as compared to $74.5 million during Fiscal 2007. Restricted cash was placed in escrow with certain banks as collateral to secure guarantees of a corresponding amount made by the banks to certain international tax authorities on behalf of the Company. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $260.5 million in Fiscal 2008, as compared to $95.2 million in Fiscal 2007. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by: increased repurchases of the Companys Class A common stock pursuant to the Companys common stock repurchase program. Approximately 6.0 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $475.4 million were repurchased in Fiscal 2008, as compared to approximately 3.5 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $231.3 million in Fiscal 2007; and a partially offsetting increase in proceeds from issuance of debt. Fiscal 2008 included the receipt of proceeds from borrowings of 20.5 billion (approximately $169 million as of the borrowing date) under a one year term loan agreement in connection with the Japanese Business Acquisitions. On a comparative basis, Fiscal 2007 included the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of 300 million principal amount ($380.0 million) of 2006 Euro Debt, offset in part by the repayment of approximately 227 million principal amount ($291.6 million) of 1999 Euro Debt. 51 Table of Contents Fiscal 2007 Compared to Fiscal 2006 Fiscal Years Ended March 31, April 1, 2007 2006 $ Change (millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 796.1 $ 449.1 $ 347.0 Net cash used in investing activities (434.6 ) (539.2 ) 104.6 Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities (95.2 ) 33.5 (128.7 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 11.9 (8.2 ) 20.1 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 278.2 $ (64.8 ) $ 343.0 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $796.1 million during Fiscal 2007, compared to $449.1 million for Fiscal 2006. This $347.0 million increase in operating cash flow was driven primarily by the increase in net income, the receipt of approximately $180 million under the new Eyewear Licensing Agreement (net of certain tax withholdings) and the absence of the $100 million payment to settle the Jones related Litigation in Fiscal 2006, partially offset by higher tax payments made in Fiscal 2007. Also offsetting the increase in operating cash flow was an increase in working capital needs during Fiscal 2007, primarily as a result of recent expansions and the overall growth in the business. This increase in working capital needs was partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable days sales outstanding as a result of improved cash collections in the Companys Wholesale segment. On a comparative basis, operating cash flows were reduced by $33.7 million as a result of a change in the reporting of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation arrangements. That is, prior to the adoption of FAS 123R, benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation costs were reported as operating cash flows. FAS 123R requires excess tax benefits to be reported as a financing cash inflow rather than in operating cash flows as a reduction of taxes paid. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $434.6 million for Fiscal 2007, as compared to $539.2 million for Fiscal 2006. The net decrease in cash used in investing activities is primarily due to acquisition related activities. In Fiscal 2007, the Company used $175 million to fund the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest in RL Media that it did not previously own, whereas in Fiscal 2006, approximately $380 million was used primarily to fund the acquisition of the Polo Jeans and Footwear Businesses. In addition, net cash used in investing activities for Fiscal 2007 included $74.5 million of restricted cash placed in escrow with certain banks as collateral to secure guarantees of a corresponding amount made by the banks to certain international tax authorities on behalf of the Company (see Restricted Cash within Note 3 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion). Net cash used in investing activities also included $184.0 million relating to capital expenditures, as compared to $158.6 million in the prior fiscal year. Net Cash (Used in)/Provided by Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $95.2 million for Fiscal 2007, compared to net cash provided by financing activities of $33.5 million in Fiscal 2006. The increase in net cash used in financing activities during Fiscal 2007 principally related to the repayment of approximately 227 million principal amount ($291.6 million) of the Companys 1999 Euro Debt and the repurchase of 3.5 million shares of Class A common stock pursuant to its common stock repurchase program at a cost of $231.3 million. Partially offsetting the increase was the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of 300 million principal amount (approximately $380 million) of 2006 Euro Debt. This net increase in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by the change in the reporting of excess tax benefits from stock based compensation arrangements of $33.7 million. Liquidity The Companys primary sources of liquidity are the cash flow generated from its operations, $450 million of availability under its credit facility, available cash and equivalents, investments and other financing options. These sources of liquidity are needed to fund the Companys ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, global retail store expansion, construction and renovation of shop in shops, investment in technological infrastructure, acquisitions, dividends, debt repayment, stock repurchases, contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax positions) and other corporate activities. Management believes that the Companys existing resources 52 Table of Contents of cash will be sufficient to support its operating, capital and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, including the finalization of acquisitions and plans for business expansion. As discussed below under the section entitled Debt and Covenant Compliance, the Company had no revolving credit borrowings outstanding under its credit facility as of March 29, 2008. However, as discussed further below, the Company may elect to draw on its credit facility or other potential sources of financing for, among other things, a material acquisition, settlement of a material contingency (including uncertain tax positions) or a material adverse business development. In May 2007, the Company completed the Japanese Business Acquisitions. These transactions were funded with available cash on hand and 20.5 billion of borrowings under a one year term loan agreement pursuant to an amendment and restatement to the Companys existing credit facility (the Term Loan). Borrowings under the Term Loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 1.2%. The Company repaid the borrowing by its maturity date on May 22, 2008 using approximately $200 million of Impact 21s cash on hand acquired as part of the acquisition. Common Stock Repurchase Program In August 2007, the Companys Board of Directors approved an expansion of the Companys existing common stock repurchase program that allowed the Company to repurchase up to an additional $250 million of Class A common stock. Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are subject to overall business and market conditions. In Fiscal 2008, 6.1 million shares of Class A common stock were repurchased at a cost of $476.4 million under the expanded and pre existing programs, including $24.0 million (0.4 million shares) that was traded prior to the end of the fiscal year for which settlement occurred in April 2008. The remaining availability under the common stock repurchase program was approximately $142 million as of March 29, 2008. In addition, during Fiscal 2008, 0.3 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $23.0 million were surrendered to, or withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under the Companys 1997 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan. In Fiscal 2007, share repurchases amounted to 3.5 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $231.3 million. In Fiscal 2006, the Company repurchased 69.3 thousand shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $3.8 million. In May 2008, the Companys Board of Directors approved a further expansion of the Companys existing common stock repurchase program that allowed the Company to repurchase up to an additional $250 million of Class A common stock. Dividends The Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per outstanding share in each quarter of Fiscal 2008, Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006. The aggregate amount of dividend payments was $20.5 million in Fiscal 2008, $20.9 million in Fiscal 2007 and $20.8 million in Fiscal 2006. The Company intends to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends on its outstanding common stock. However, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, the Companys results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Debt and Covenant Compliance Euro Debt The Company has outstanding approximately 300 million principal amount of 4.5% notes due October 4, 2013 (the 2006 Euro Debt). The Company has the option to redeem all of the 2006 Euro Debt at any time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus a premium. The Company also has the option to redeem all of the 2006 Euro Debt at any time at par plus accrued interest, in the event of certain developments involving U.S. tax law. Partial redemption of the 2006 Euro Debt is not permitted in either instance. In the event of a change of control 53 Table of Contents of the Company, each holder of the 2006 Euro Debt has the option to require the Company to redeem the 2006 Euro Debt at its principal amount plus accrued interest. The carrying value of the 2006 Euro Debt was $472.8 million and $398.8 million as of March 29, 2008 and March 31, 2007, respectively. Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan The Company has a credit facility that provides for a $450 million unsecured revolving line of credit through November 2011 (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility also is used to support the issuance of letters of credit. As of March 29, 2008, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility, but the Company was contingently liable for $23.0 million of outstanding letters of credit (primarily relating to inventory purchase commitments). The Company has the ability to expand its borrowing availability to $600 million subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Companys option, either at (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (i) the prime commercial lending rate of JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect from time to time and (ii) the weighted average overnight Federal funds rate (as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) plus 50 basis points or (b) a LIBOR rate in effect from time to time, as adjusted for the Federal Reserve Boards Euro currency liabilities maximum reserve percentage plus a margin defined in the Credit Facility (the applicable margin). The applicable margin of 35 basis points is subject to adjustment based on the Companys credit ratings. In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate of 8 basis points under the terms of the Credit Facility also is subject to adjustment based on the Companys credit ratings. The Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Companys ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens and contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets, including equity interests; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not in a related line of business; make loans, advances or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make investments. In addition, the Credit Facility requires the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to Consolidated EBITDAR (the leverage ratio), as such terms are defined in the Credit Facility. As of March 29, 2008, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the Credit Facility) has occurred under the Companys Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The Credit Facility specifies a number of events of default (many of which are subject to applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure to make timely principal and interest payments or to satisfy the covenants, including the financial covenant described above. Additionally, the Credit Facility provides that an Event of Default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and related entities controlled by Mr. Lauren fail to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power of the Companys common stock. The Credit Facility was amended and restated as of May 22, 2007 to provide for the addition of the Term Loan made to Polo JP Acqui B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The Term Loan was guaranteed by the Company, as well as the other subsidiaries of the Company which currently guarantee the Credit Facility. The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to finance the Japanese Business Acquisitions. Borrowings under the Term Loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 1.2%. The Company repaid the borrowing by its maturity date on May 22, 2008 using approximately $200 million of Impact 21s cash on hand acquired as part of the acquisition. See Note 5 for further discussion of the Japanese Business Acquisitions. 54 Table of Contents Contractual and Other Obligations Firm Commitments The following table summarizes certain of the Companys aggregate contractual obligations as of March 29, 2008, and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on the Companys liquidity and cash flow in future periods. The Company expects to fund the firm commitments with operating cash flow generated in the normal course of business and, if necessary, availability under its $450 million credit facility or other potential sources of financing. Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2014 and 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total (millions) Term Loan $ 206.4 $ $ $ $ 206.4 Euro Debt 472.8 472.8 Capital leases 8.0 14.9 12.5 37.8 73.2 Operating leases 188.1 321.3 255.7 670.7 1,435.8 Inventory purchase commitments 697.4 697.4 Total $ 1,099.9 $ 336.2 $ 268.2 $ 1,181.3 $ 2,885.6 The following is a description of the Companys material, firmly committed contractual obligations as of March 29, 2008: Term Loan represents the principal amount due at maturity of the Companys outstanding Term Loan on a U.S. dollar equivalent basis. The Term Loan was repaid on May 22, 2008 using available cash on hand; Euro Debt represents the principal amount due at maturity of the Companys outstanding 2006 Euro Debt on a U.S. dollar equivalent basis. Amounts do not include any fair value adjustments, call premiums or interest payments; Lease obligations represent the minimum lease rental payments under noncancelable leases for the Companys real estate and operating equipment in various locations around the world. Approximately 78% of these lease obligations relates to the Companys retail operations. Information has been presented separately for operating and capital leases. In addition to such amounts, the Company is normally required to pay taxes, insurance and occupancy costs relating to its leased real estate properties; and Inventory purchase commitments represent the Companys legally binding agreements to purchase fixed or minimum quantities of goods at determinable prices. Excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the non current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $155.2 million recognized as a result of the adoption of FIN 48. This liability for unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded because the Company cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever. The above table also excludes the following: (i) amounts included in current liabilities, other than the current maturities of debt, in the consolidated balance sheet as of March 29, 2008 as these items will be paid within one year; and (ii) non current liabilities that have no cash outflows associated with them (e.g., deferred revenue) or the cash outflows associated with them are uncertain or do not represent a purchase obligation as the term is used herein (e.g., deferred taxes and other miscellaneous items). The Company also has certain contractual arrangements that would require it to make payments if certain circumstances occur. See Note 15 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a description of the Companys contingent commitments not included in the above table. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Companys off balance sheet firm commitments, which include outstanding letters of credit and minimum funding commitments to investees, amounted to approximately $29.8 million as of March 29, 2008. The Company 55 Table of Contents does not maintain any other off balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon its financial condition or results of operations. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to a variety of risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain anticipated cash flows from its international operations and possible declines in the fair value of reported net assets of certain of its foreign operations, as well as changes in the fair value of its fixed rate debt relating to changes in interest rates. Consequently, in the normal course of business the Company employs established policies and procedures, including the use of derivative financial instruments, to manage such risks. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other financial factors. The Companys established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk on derivative transactions include reviewing and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company manages its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts. Refer to Note 14 to the audited consolidated financial statements for a summarization of the notional amounts and fair values of the Companys foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of March 29, 2008. Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts General From time to time, the Company may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts as hedges to reduce its risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases, intercompany royalty payments made by certain of its international operations, intercompany contributions made to fund certain marketing efforts of its international operations, other foreign currency denominated operational obligations including payroll, rent, insurance, and benefit payments, and foreign currency denominated revenues. As part of its overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily to changes in the value of the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Swiss Franc, and the British Pound Sterling, the Company hedges a portion of its foreign currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing twelve month to two year periods. In doing so, the Company uses foreign currency exchange contracts that generally have maturities of three months to two years to provide continuing coverage throughout the hedging period. The Company records the above described foreign currency exchange contracts at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at hedge inception are accounted for in accordance with FAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and subsequent amendments (collectively, FAS 133). As such, to the extent these hedges are effective the related gains or losses are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. These deferred gains and losses are then recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as follows: Inventory Purchases Recognized as part of the cost of the inventory being hedged within cost of goods sold when the related inventory is sold. Intercompany Royalty Payments and Marketing Contributions Recognized within foreign currency gains (losses) in the period in which the related royalties or marketing contributions being hedged are received or paid. Operational Obligations Recognized primarily within SGA expenses in the period in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. The Company recognized a net loss on foreign currency exchange contracts in earnings of approximately $8 million for Fiscal 2008, and net gains of approximately $4 million and $5 million for Fiscal 2007 and Fiscal 2006, respectively. 56 Table of Contents Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts Other On October 10, 2007, the Company entered into a foreign exchange contract to purchase 13.5 million at a fixed rate. This contract hedges the foreign currency exposure related to the annual Euro interest payment due on October 6, 2008 for Fiscal 2009 in connection with the Companys outstanding 2006 Euro Debt. In accordance with FAS 133, the contract has been designated as a cash flow hedge. Since neither the terms of the hedge contract or the underlying exposure have changed, the related gains of $0.7 million have been reclassified from stockholders equity to foreign currency gains (losses) within our consolidated statement of operations to offset the related transaction loss arising from the remeasurement of the associated foreign currency denominated accrued interest liability, as permitted by FAS 133, during Fiscal 2008. On April 2, 2007, the Company entered into a similar foreign exchange contract to purchase 13.5 million at a fixed rate, hedging the foreign currency exposure related to the annual Euro interest payment made on October 4, 2007 for Fiscal 2008. This contract also was designated as a cash flow hedge. Consistent with the accounting treatment discussed above, the related gains of $1.1 million were reclassified from stockholders equity to foreign currency gains (losses) within our consolidated statement of operations during Fiscal 2008. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2008, the Company entered into foreign currency option contracts with a notional value of $159 million giving the Company the right, but not the obligation, to purchase foreign currencies at fixed rates by May 23, 2007. These contracts hedged the majority of the foreign currency exposure related to the financing of the Japanese Business Acquisitions, but did not qualify under FAS 133 for hedge accounting treatment. The Company did not exercise any of the contracts and recognized a loss of $1.6 million within foreign currency gains (losses) in our consolidated statement of operations during the first quarter of Fiscal 2008. In addition, during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2008, the Company entered into a foreign currency exchange contract with a notional value of $5 million hedging the foreign currency exposure related to an intercompany term loan provided by Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation to Ralph Lauren Retail Japan (RLRJ) in connection with the Japanese Business Acquisitions minority squeeze out, as discussed in Note 5. This contract, which hedges the foreign currency exposure related to a Yen denominated payment to be made by RLRJ during the first quarter of Fiscal 2009, did not qualify under FAS 133 for hedge accounting treatment. As such, the Company recognized a related loss of $0.4 million within foreign currency gains (losses) in our consolidated statement of operations during Fiscal 2008. Sensitivity The Company performs a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of the Companys derivative financial instruments. To perform the sensitivity analysis, the Company assesses the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This analysis assumes a like movement by all foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio against the U.S. dollar. Based on all foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of March 29, 2008, a 10% devaluation of the U.S. dollar as compared to the level of foreign currency exchange rates for currencies under contract as of March 29, 2008 would result in approximately $2 million of net unrealized losses. Conversely, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar would result in approximately $2 million of net unrealized gains. As the Companys outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts are primarily designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions, the unrealized loss or gain as a result of a 10% devaluation or appreciation would be largely offset by changes in the underlying hedged items. Hedge of a Net Investment in Certain European Subsidiaries The Company designated the entire principal amount of its outstanding 2006 Euro Debt as a hedge of its net investment in certain of its European subsidiaries. As required by FAS 133, the changes in fair value of a derivative instrument or a non derivative financial instrument (such as debt) that is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are reported in the same manner as a translation adjustment under FAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, to the extent it is effective as a hedge. As such, changes in the fair value of the 2006 Euro Debt resulting from changes in the Euro exchange rate have been, and continue to be, reported in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company recorded within accumulated 57 Table of Contents other comprehensive income the translation effects of the 2006 Euro Debt to U.S. dollars, resulting in net losses of $45.4 million for Fiscal 2008 and $24.5 million for Fiscal 2007, and a net gain of $4.2 million for Fiscal 2006. Interest Rate Risk Management During the first six months of Fiscal 2007, the Company entered into three forward starting interest rate swap contracts aggregating 200 million notional amount of indebtedness in anticipation of the Companys proposed refinancing of the 1999 Euro Debt, which was completed in October 2006. The Company designated these agreements as a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction to issue new debt in connection with the planned refinancing of its 1999 Euro Debt. The interest rate swaps hedged a total of 200.0 million, a portion of the underlying interest rate exposure on the anticipated refinancing. Under the terms of the three interest swap contracts, the Company paid a weighted average fixed rate of interest of 4.1% and received variable interest based upon six month EURIBOR. The Company terminated the swaps on September 28, 2006, which was the date the interest rate for the 2006 Euro Debt was determined. As a result, the Company made a payment of approximately 3.5 million ($4.4 million based on the exchange rate in effect on that date) in settlement of the swaps. An amount of $0.2 million was recognized as a loss for the three months ending September 30, 2006 due to the partial ineffectiveness of the cash flow hedge as a result of the forecasted transaction closing on October 5, 2006 instead of November 22, 2006 (the maturity date of the 1999 Euro Debt). The remaining loss of $4.2 million has been deferred as a component of comprehensive income within stockholders equity and is being recognized in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense over the seven year term of the 2006 Euro Debt. Sensitivity As of March 29, 2008, the Company had no variable rate debt outstanding. As such, the Companys exposure to changes in interest rates primarily related to its fixed rate 2006 Euro Debt. As of March 29, 2008, the carrying value of the 2006 Euro Debt was $472.8 million and the fair value was $423.0 million. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of the 2006 Euro Debt by approximately $5 million. Such potential increases or decreases are based on certain simplifying assumptions, including no changes in Euro currency exchange rates and an immediate across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period. The Term Loan of 20.5 billion made to Polo JP Acqui, B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, was repaid by the Company by its maturity date on May 22, 2008 using approximately $200 million of Impact 21s cash on hand acquired as part of the Japanese Business Acquisitions. Investment Risk Management The Company evaluates investments held in unrealized loss positions for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. Such evaluation involves a variety of considerations, including assessments of risks and uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers. Factors considered by the Company include (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost, (ii) the financial condition, credit worthiness and near term prospects of the issuer, (iii) the length of time to maturity, (iv) future economic conditions and market forecasts and (v) the Companys intent and ability to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value. As of March 29, 2008, the fair value of the Companys available for sale investments was $0.4 million below their respective par value. This gross unrealized loss has been recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income in the Companys consolidated balance sheet, as the Company believes the investments are not other than temporarily impaired. The Company limits its exposure by primarily investing in highly rated investments issued by municipalities. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The SECs Financial Reporting Release No. 60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies (FRR 60), suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the Companys financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimation on 58 Table of Contents the part of management in its application. The Companys estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. The Company believes that the following list represents its critical accounting policies as contemplated by FRR 60. For a discussion of all of the Companys significant accounting policies, see Notes 3 and 4 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements. Sales Reserves and Uncollectible Accounts A significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and net income is estimating sales reserves, which represent that portion of gross revenues not expected to be realized. In particular, wholesale revenue is reduced by estimates of returns, discounts, end of season markdowns, operational chargebacks and certain cooperative advertising allowances. Retail revenue, including e commerce sales, also is reduced by estimates of returns. In determining estimates of returns, discounts, end of season markdowns and operational chargebacks, management analyzes historical trends, seasonal results, current economic and market conditions and retailer performance. The Company reviews and refines these estimates on a quarterly basis. The Companys historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. Similarly, management evaluates accounts receivables to determine if they will ultimately be collected. Significant judgments and estimates are involved in this evaluation, including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for larger accounts and customers, and a receivables aging analysis that determines the percentage of receivables that has historically been uncollected by aged category. Based on this information, management provides a reserve for the estimated amounts believed to be uncollectible. Although management believes that the Companys major customers are sound and creditworthy, a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on the Companys net sales, cash flows and or financial condition. See Accounts Receivable in Note 3 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the activity in the Companys sales reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts for each of the three fiscal years presented. Inventories The Company holds inventory that is sold through wholesale distribution channels to major department stores and specialty retail stores, including its own retail stores. The Company also holds retail inventory that is sold in its own stores directly to consumers. Wholesale and retail inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value. Cost for wholesale inventories is determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method and cost for retail inventories is determined on a moving average cost basis. The Company continually evaluates the composition of its inventories, assessing slow turning product and fashion product. Estimated realizable value of distressed inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of the Companys individual product lines for this category of inventory, the impact of market trends and economic conditions, and the value of current orders in house relating to the future sales of this category of inventory. Estimates may differ from actual results due to quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions. The Companys historical estimates of these costs and its provisions have not differed materially from actual results. Reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk over physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts. Purchase Accounting The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. As such, the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often 59 Table of Contents involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. In addition, in connection with its recent business acquisitions, the Company has settled certain pre existing relationships. These pre existing relationships include licensing agreements and litigation in the case of the acquisition of the Polo Jeans Business. In accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 1, Accounting for Pre existing Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination, the Company is required to allocate the aggregate consideration exchanged in these transactions between the value of the business acquired and the value of the settlement of any pre existing relationships in proportion to estimates of their respective fair values. If the terms of the pre existing relationships were determined to not be reflective of market, a settlement gain or loss would be recognized in earnings. Accordingly, significant judgment is required to determine the respective fair values of the business acquired and the value of the settlement of the pre existing relationship. The Company has historically utilized independent valuation firms to assist in the determination of fair value. Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS 142). Under FAS 142, goodwill, including any goodwill included in the carrying value of investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually based on comparisons of their respective fair values to their carrying values. Finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable in accordance with FAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (FAS 144). In accordance with FAS 142, goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired and performance of the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge. To assist management in the process of determining goodwill impairment, the Company obtains appraisals from independent valuation firms. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons and recent transactions. These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting the risks inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables. The impairment test for other indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess. In addition, in evaluating finite lived intangible assets for recoverability, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset 60 Table of Contents and eventual disposition in accordance with FAS 144. To the extent the estimated future, undiscounted cash inflows attributable to the asset, less estimated future, undiscounted cash outflows, are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference. There have been no impairment losses recorded in connection with the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets during any of the three fiscal years presented. Impairment of Other Long Lived Assets Property and equipment, along with other long lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable in accordance with FAS 144. In evaluating long lived assets for recoverability, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. In determining future cash flows, the Company takes various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the emphasis on retail store cost controls, and the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and increased local advertising. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations. During Fiscal 2008, the Company recorded impairment charges of $5.0 million to reduce the carrying value of certain long lived assets in its Retail segment to their estimated fair value. No impairment charges were recorded in Fiscal 2007. During Fiscal 2006, the Company recorded impairment charges of $10.8 million to reduce the carrying value of certain retail fixed assets to their estimated fair value. Income Taxes Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method prescribed by FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FAS 109). Under this method, income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets and liabilities, current taxes payable/refunds receivable and tax expense) are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the results of any difference between US GAAP and tax reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating loss, capital loss and general business credit carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. The Company accounts for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates in the period of enactment. In addition, valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments to those balances. Effective April 1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48. Upon the adoption of the provisions of FIN 48, the Company changed its policy related to the accounting for income tax uncertainties. If the Company considers that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, it recognizes the tax benefit. The Company measures the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. These assessments can be complex and require significant judgment, and the Company often obtains assistance from external advisors. To the extent that the Companys estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. If the initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, the Company regularly monitors its position and subsequently recognizes the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not, (ii) the statute of limitations expires, or (iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when the Company expects to pay cash 61 Table of Contents within the next twelve months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded within the provision for income taxes in the Companys consolidated statements of operations and are classified on the consolidated balance sheets with the related liability for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 12 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Companys income taxes and the adoption of FIN 48. Contingencies The Company periodically is exposed to various contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting its business, including certain litigations, alleged information system security breach matters, contractual disputes, employee relation matters, various tax audits, and trademark and intellectual property matters and disputes. In accordance with FAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (FAS 5), the Company records a liability for such contingencies to the extent that it concludes their occurrence is probable and the related losses are estimable. In addition, if it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement of a contingency could exceed the established liability, the Company discloses the estimated impact on its liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Management considers many factors in making these assessments. As the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable, these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions. As a result, the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on estimates and assumptions. Stock based Compensation Effective April 2, 2006, the Company adopted FAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment (FAS 123R or the Statement), using the modified prospective application transition method. Under this transition method, the compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of operations beginning April 2, 2006 includes compensation expense for (a) all stock based payments granted prior to, but not yet vested as of April 1, 2006, based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of FAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, as amended by FAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure (FAS 123) and (b) all stock based payments granted subsequent to April 1, 2006 based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of FAS 123R. Prior to April 2, 2006, the Company accounted for stock based compensation plans under the intrinsic value method in accordance with Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (APB 25), and adopted the disclosure only provisions of FAS 123. Accordingly, the Company did not recognize compensation expense for the issuance of stock options with an exercise price equal to or greater than the market price at the date of grant. However, as required, the Company disclosed, in the notes to the consolidated financial statements, the pro forma expense impact of the stock option grants as if the fair value based recognition provisions of FAS 123 were applied. Compensation expense was previously recognized for restricted stock and restricted stock units. The effect of forfeitures on restricted stock and restricted stock units was recognized when such forfeitures occurred. Stock Options Stock options are granted to employees and non employee directors with exercise prices equal to fair market value at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. Certain key assumptions involve estimating future uncertain events. The key factors influencing the estimation process include the expected term of the option, the expected stock price volatility factor, the expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate, among others. Generally, once stock option values are determined, current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from the actuals. Determining the fair value of stock based compensation at the date of grant requires significant judgment by management, including estimates of the above Black Scholes assumptions. In addition, judgment is required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, if management changes its assumptions for future stock based award grants, or if there are 62 Table of Contents changes in market conditions, stock based compensation expense and the Companys results of operations could be materially impacted. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) The Company grants restricted shares of Class A common stock and service based RSUs to certain of its senior executives and non employee directors. In addition, the Company grants performance based RSUs to such senior executives and other key executives, and certain other employees of the Company. The fair values of restricted stock shares and RSUs are based on the fair value of unrestricted Class A common stock, as adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for those restricted securities that are not entitled to dividend equivalents. Compensation expense for performance based RSUs is recognized over the related service period when attainment of the performance goals is deemed probable, which involves judgment on the part of management.
