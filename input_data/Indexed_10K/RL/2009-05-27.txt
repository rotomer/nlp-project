Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations The following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for Fiscal 2009 (Fiscal 2009 10 K). We utilize a 52 53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31. As such, fiscal year 2009 ended on March 28, 2009 and reflected a 52 week period (Fiscal 2009); fiscal year 2008 ended on March 29, 2008 and reflected a 52 week period (Fiscal 2008); and fiscal year 2007 ended on March 31, 2007 and also reflected a 52 week period (Fiscal 2007). INTRODUCTION Managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MDA) is provided as a supplement to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition and liquidity, changes in financial condition, and results of our operations. MDA is organized as follows: Overview. This section provides a general description of our business, including our objectives and risks, and a summary of financial performance for Fiscal 2009. In addition, this section includes a discussion of recent developments and transactions affecting comparability that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and financial condition, and in anticipating future trends. Results of operations. This section provides an analysis of our results of operations for Fiscal 2009, Fiscal 2008 and Fiscal 2007. Financial condition and liquidity. This section provides an analysis of our cash flows for Fiscal 2009, Fiscal 2008 and Fiscal 2007, as well as a discussion of our financial condition and liquidity as of March 28, 2009. The discussion of our financial condition and liquidity includes (i) our available financial capacity under our credit facility, (ii) a summary of our key debt compliance measures and (iii) a summary of our outstanding debt and commitments as of March 28, 2009. Market risk management. This section discusses how we manage our risk exposures related to interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and our investments, as well as the underlying market conditions as of March 28, 2009. Critical accounting policies. This section discusses accounting policies considered to be important to our financial condition and results of operations, which require significant judgment and estimation on the part of management in their application. In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies, are summarized in Notes 3 and 4 to our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements. Recently issued accounting standards. This section discusses the potential impact to our reported financial condition and results of operations of accounting standards that have been issued, but which we have not yet adopted. OVERVIEW Our Business Our Company is a global leader in the design, marketing and distribution of premium lifestyle products including mens, womens and childrens apparel, accessories, fragrances and home furnishings. Our long standing reputation and distinctive image have been consistently developed across an expanding number of products, brands and international markets. Our brand names include Polo by Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Ralph Lauren Collection, Black Label, Blue Label, Lauren by Ralph Lauren, RRL, RLX, Rugby, Ralph Lauren Childrenswear, American Living, Chaps and Club Monaco, among others. 33 Table of Contents We classify our businesses into three segments: Wholesale, Retail and Licensing. Our wholesale business (representing approximately 57% of Fiscal 2009 net revenues) consists of wholesale channel sales made principally to major department stores, specialty stores and golf and pro shops located throughout the U.S., Europe and Asia. Our retail business (representing approximately 39% of Fiscal 2009 net revenues) consists of retail channel sales directly to consumers through full price and factory retail stores located throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, South America and Asia, and through our retail internet sites located at www.RalphLauren.com and www.Rugby.com. In addition, our licensing business (representing approximately 4% of Fiscal 2009 net revenues) consists of royalty based arrangements under which we license the right to third parties to use our various trademarks in connection with the manufacture and sale of designated products, such as apparel, eyewear and fragrances, in specified geographical areas for specified periods. Approximately 28% of our Fiscal 2009 net revenues was earned in international regions outside of the U.S. and Canada. See Note 21 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of net revenues by geographic location. Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and key vacation travel, back to school and holiday shopping periods in the Retail segment. Our Objectives and Risks Our core strengths include a portfolio of global luxury lifestyle brands, a strong and experienced management team, a proven ability to develop and extend our brands distributed through multiple retail channels in global markets, a disciplined investment philosophy and a solid balance sheet. Despite the various risks associated with the deterioration in the global economic environment as further discussed below, we believe our core strengths will allow us to continue to execute our strategy for long term sustainable growth in revenue, net income and operating cash flow. Our financial performance has been driven by the Companys focus on six key objectives: Creating unique businesses primarily centered around one core and heritage driven brand; Diversifying and expanding our products and prices, distribution channels and geographic regions; Improving brand control and positioning; Focusing on selective strategic partnerships; Implementing infrastructure improvements that support a worldwide business; and Funding our expansion through strong operating cash flow. As our business has grown, our portfolio mix and brand control has evolved from primarily that of a mono brand U.S. centric menswear wholesaler with a broad array of product and geographic licenses to that of a portfolio of lifestyle brands with a direct control model over most of our brands, products and international territories. We believe that this broader and better diversified portfolio mix positions us for ongoing growth, offering our customers a range of products, price points and channels of distribution, and our size and global operations favorably position us to take advantage of synergies in design, sourcing and distribution. While balancing our long term key strategic objectives with our near term priorities to manage through the many risks associated with the weakened global economic environment, including a significant contraction in consumer spending, we intend to continue to pursue select opportunities for growth during the course of Fiscal 2010 and beyond. These opportunities and continued investment initiatives include: International Growth Opportunities The transition of our wholesale and retail businesses in Southeast Asia from a licensed to a wholly owned operation effective January 1, 2010, and the development of a supporting organizational infrastructure; and Ongoing development and integration of our recently acquired Japanese businesses, including the continued execution of our plans to build a supporting organizational infrastructure and retail business. 34 Table of Contents Brand Extension and Product Diversification Growth Opportunities Further development of a wide array of luxury accessories product offerings, including handbags, footwear, small leathergoods and watches/jewelry; and The continued expansion of our Lauren product line in Europe and other international markets. Direct to Consumer Growth Opportunities Global expansion of our direct to consumer presence in various formats and key markets, including Paris, France. Cost Savings Opportunities The ongoing evaluation of strategies to better align our cost base with lower sales trends associated with the recent contraction in consumer spending. Global Economic Developments Our opportunities for long term growth are accompanied by significant challenges and risks, particularly in the near term. Over the course of the past year, the global economic environment has deteriorated significantly and has evolved into what is commonly called a global economic crisis. Negative developments have included declining values in real estate, restricted criteria for obtaining credit and capital, liquidity concerns for most borrowers, the failure of certain major financial institutions, rising unemployment, and significant declines and volatility in global financial markets. In response to these unprecedented economic conditions, the United States and many other countries have taken a number of significant measures designed to stabilize the state of their financial systems. Notwithstanding these measures, consumer confidence in the U.S., as measured by the Conference Board, has been at all time low levels. The global economic crisis has negatively impacted to a significant degree the level of consumer spending for discretionary items over the course of the past year and through April 2009. This has negatively affected our business as it is highly dependent on consumer demand for our products. Despite the more challenging economic environment that affected both the Companys wholesale customers and retail channels, we continued to experience reported revenue growth during Fiscal 2009. However, beginning in October 2008, our Retail segment began to experience sharp declines in comparative store sales, as did many of our traditional wholesale customers. In particular, our comparable store sales for the second half of Fiscal 2009 declined approximately 23% for full price Ralph Lauren sales, approximately 19% for full price Club Monaco sales and approximately 6% for factory store sales. To realign our cost base with lower sales trends, the Company initiated a restructuring plan during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009. This plan included a reduction in workforce and the closure of certain underperforming retail stores. Cost reduction actions related to the restructuring plan are anticipated to result in annualized pretax cash savings of approximately $25 million beginning in Fiscal 2010. We also have mitigated the impact of the contraction in consumer spending by taking proactive measures to scale back our inventory levels across all channels, with inventory down approximately 2% at the end of Fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year excluding the effects of acquisitions. The global economic environment and the related contraction in the anticipated level of consumer spending will likely continue to have a negative effect on our sales and operating margins across all segments for the foreseeable future. As of March 28, 2009, largely in response to the global macroeconomic environment, our traditional retail partners have reduced their initial wholesale orders for Fall 2009 apparel products by approximately 10%. We continue to evaluate strategies to control costs by focusing on operational efficiencies on a Company wide basis, by conservatively managing our inventory levels, and by controlling capital spending. The implementation of these strategies may necessitate additional cost savings actions going forward. For a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Fiscal 2009 10 K. 35 Table of Contents Summary of Financial Performance Operating Results During Fiscal 2009, we reported revenues of $5.019 billion, net income of $406.0 million and net income per diluted share of $4.01. This compares to revenues of $4.880 billion, net income of $419.8 million and net income per diluted share of $3.99 during Fiscal 2008. As discussed further below, the comparability of our operating results has been affected by recent acquisitions and $79.0 million of pretax charges recognized in Fiscal 2009 related to asset impairments and restructurings. Our operating performance for Fiscal 2009 included revenue growth of 2.8%, principally due to the inclusion of a full year of revenues from the newly launched American Living product line, increased revenues from our European and Japanese Wholesale businesses, continued growth in RalphLauren.com and Rugby.com sales (collectively, RalphLauren.com), and net favorable foreign currency effects. These increases were partially offset by a net decline in comparable global Retail store sales and lower Wholesale sales to our traditional department and specialty store customers in the U.S. associated with the current weakened global economic environment. We also experienced an increase in gross profit percentage of 30 basis points to 54.4%, primarily due to the growth of our European and Japanese Wholesale operations, as well as the net decrease of unfavorable purchase accounting effects in our Wholesale and Retail segments. These increases were partially offset by increased markdown activity and higher reductions in the carrying cost of our retail inventory, largely relating to the current economic downturn. Selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses increased during Fiscal 2009 attributable largely to our new business initiatives. Net income declined during Fiscal 2009 as compared to Fiscal 2008, principally due to a $57.9 million decrease in operating income, offset in part by a $40.8 million decrease in the provision for income taxes. The decrease in the provision for income taxes was driven by a 370 basis point decline in our effective tax rate and the overall decrease in pretax income. Net income per diluted share slightly increased compared to the prior fiscal year, as the effect of lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding was mostly offset by the decrease in net income in Fiscal 2009. These results were negatively impacted by $79.0 million of pretax charges recognized in Fiscal 2009 related to asset impairments and restructurings, which had an aggregate effect of reducing net income in Fiscal 2009 by $49.7 million ($0.49 per diluted share). Financial Condition and Liquidity Our financial position reflects the overall relative strength of our business results. We ended Fiscal 2009 in a net cash and short term investments position (total cash and cash equivalents, plus short term investments less total debt) of $413.5 million, compared to a net debt position (total debt less total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments) of $53.4 million as of the end of Fiscal 2008. The improvement in our financial position was primarily due to growth in operating cash flows, partially offset by our treasury stock repurchases, capital expenditures and the funding of our recent Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition (as defined under Recent Developments). Our stockholders equity increased to $2.735 billion as of March 28, 2009, compared to $2.390 billion as of March 29, 2008. This increase was primarily due to our net income during Fiscal 2009, offset in part by our share repurchase activity. We generated $774.2 million of cash from operations during Fiscal 2009, compared to $695.4 million during Fiscal 2008. We used our cash availability to support our common stock repurchase program, to reinvest in our business through capital spending, to fund our Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition for approximately $26.0 million, and to repay $196.8 million of debt that matured in May 2008 relating to our Japanese Business Acquisitions (as defined under Recent Developments). In particular, we used $169.8 million to repurchase 2.5 million shares of Class A common stock. We also spent $185.0 million for capital expenditures primarily associated with global retail store expansion, construction and renovation of department store shop within shops and investments in our facilities and technological infrastructure. 36 Table of Contents Transactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition The comparability of the Companys operating results for the three fiscal years presented herein has been affected by certain transactions, including: Acquisitions that occurred in Fiscal 2009, Fiscal 2008 and Fiscal 2007. In particular, the Company completed the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition on August 1, 2008, the Japanese Business Acquisitions on May 29, 2007, the Small Leathergoods Business Acquisition on April 13, 2007 and the RL Media Minority Interest Acquisition on March 28, 2007 (each as defined in Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements); Certain pretax charges related to asset impairments and restructurings during the fiscal years presented; and The adoption of the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 109 (FIN 48) as of the beginning of Fiscal 2008. The incremental impact of the adoption of FIN 48 decreased the effective tax rate by 97 basis points in Fiscal 2008. See Note 13 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Companys adoption of FIN 48. A summary of the effect of certain of these items on pretax income for each applicable fiscal year presented is noted below (references to Notes are to the notes to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements): Fiscal Years Ended March 28, March 29, March 31, 2009 2008 2007 (millions) Impairments of assets (see Note 11) $ (55.4 ) $ (5.0 ) $ Restructuring charges (see Note 12) (23.6 ) (4.6 ) $ (79.0 ) $ (5.0 ) $ (4.6 ) The following discussion of results of operations highlights, as necessary, the significant changes in operating results arising from these items and transactions. However, unusual items or transactions may occur in any period. Accordingly, investors and other financial statement users individually should consider the types of events and transactions that have affected operating trends. Recent Developments Agreement to Acquire Southeast Asia Licensed Operations In February 2009, the Company entered into an agreement with Dickson Concepts International Limited (Dickson) to assume direct control of its Polo branded licensed apparel businesses in Southeast Asia effective January 1, 2010 in exchange for a payment of $20 million and certain other consideration. Dickson is currently the Companys licensee for Polo branded apparel in the Southeast Asia region, which is comprised of China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. In connection with this agreement, the Company entered into a one year extension of its underlying sub license agreement with Dickson, which was originally scheduled to expire on December 31, 2008. The transaction is subject to certain customary closing conditions. The Company expects to account for this transaction as an asset purchase during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010. Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition On August 1, 2008, in connection with the transition of the Polo branded childrenswear and golf apparel businesses in Japan from a licensed to a wholly owned operation, the Company acquired certain net assets (including inventory) from Naigai Co. Ltd. (Naigai) in exchange for a payment of approximately 2.8 billion (approximately $26 million as of the acquisition date) and certain other consideration (the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition). The Company funded the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition with available cash on hand. Naigai was the Companys licensee for childrenswear, golf apparel and hosiery under the Polo by Ralph Lauren and Ralph Lauren brands in Japan. In conjunction with the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition, 37 Table of Contents the Company also entered into an additional 5 year licensing and design related agreement with Naigai for Polo and Chaps branded hosiery in Japan and a transition services agreement for the provision of a variety of operational, human resources and information systems related services over a period of up to eighteen months from the date of the closing of the transaction. The results of operations for the Polo branded childrenswear and golf apparel businesses in Japan have been consolidated in the Companys results of operations commencing August 2, 2008. Japanese Business Acquisitions On May 29, 2007, the Company acquired control of certain of its Japanese businesses that were formerly conducted under licensed arrangements, consistent with the Companys long term strategy of international expansion. In particular, the Company acquired approximately 77% of the outstanding shares of Impact 21 Co., Ltd. (Impact 21) that it did not previously own in a cash tender offer (the Impact 21 Acquisition), thereby increasing its ownership in Impact 21 from approximately 20% to approximately 97%. Impact 21 previously conducted the Companys mens, womens and jeans apparel and accessories business in Japan under a pre existing, sub license arrangement. In addition, the Company acquired the remaining 50% interest in Polo Ralph Lauren Japan Corporation (PRL Japan), which holds the master license to conduct Polos business in Japan, from Onward Kashiyama and Seibu (the PRL Japan Minority Interest Acquisition). Collectively, the Impact 21 Acquisition and the PRL Japan Minority Interest Acquisition are herein referred to as the Japanese Business Acquisitions. The purchase price initially paid in connection with the Japanese Business Acquisitions was approximately $360 million, including transaction costs of approximately $12 million. In February 2008, the Company acquired approximately 1% of the remaining Impact 21 shares outstanding at an aggregate cost of $5 million. During the first quarter of Fiscal 2009, the Company acquired the remaining 2% of Impact 21 shares outstanding at an aggregate cost of approximately $9 million and completed the process of acquiring the remaining outstanding shares not exchanged as of the close of the tender offer period (the minority squeeze out). As a result of these transactions, Impact 21 is a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company. The Company funded the Japanese Business Acquisitions with available cash on hand and 20.5 billion of borrowings under a one year term loan agreement pursuant to an amendment and restatement to the Companys existing credit facility. The Company repaid the borrowing by its maturity date on May 22, 2008 using $196.8 million of Impact 21s cash on hand acquired as part of the acquisition. The results of operations for Impact 21, which were previously accounted for using the equity method of accounting, have been consolidated in the Companys results of operations commencing April 1, 2007. Accordingly, the Company recorded within minority interest expense the amount of Impact 21s net income allocable to the holders of the approximate 80% of the Impact 21 shares not owned by the Company prior to the closing date of the tender offer. The results of operations for PRL Japan had already been consolidated by the Company in all prior periods. See Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Companys acquisitions during the fiscal years presented. American Living In Fiscal 2008, the Company launched American Living, a new lifestyle brand created exclusively in the U.S. for distribution by J.C. Penney Company, Inc. (JCPenney) through the Companys Global Brand Concepts group. The Company began shipping related product to JCPenney in December 2007. See Overview Global Economic Developments. 38 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 The following table summarizes our results of operations and expresses the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain financial statement captions: Fiscal Years Ended March 28, March 29, 2009 2008 $ Change % Change (millions, except per share data) Net revenues $ 5,018.9 $ 4,880.1 $ 138.8 2.8 % Cost of goods sold(a) (2,288.2 ) (2,242.0 ) (46.2 ) 2.1 % Gross profit 2,730.7 2,638.1 92.6 3.5 % Gross profit as % of net revenues 54.4 % 54.1 % Selling, general and administrative expenses(a) (2,036.0 ) (1,932.5 ) (103.5 ) 5.4 % SGA as % of net revenues 40.6 % 39.6 % Amortization of intangible assets (20.2 ) (47.2 ) 27.0 (57.2 ) % Impairments of assets (55.4 ) (5.0 ) (50.4 ) 1,008.0 % Restructuring charges (23.6 ) (23.6 ) NM Operating income 595.5 653.4 (57.9 ) (8.9 ) % Operating income as % of net revenues 11.9 % 13.4 % Foreign currency gains (losses) 1.6 (6.4 ) 8.0 (125.0 ) % Interest expense (26.6 ) (25.7 ) (0.9 ) 3.5 % Interest and other income, net 22.0 24.7 (2.7 ) (10.9 ) % Equity in income (loss) of equity method investees (5.0 ) (1.8 ) (3.2 ) 177.8 % Minority interest expense (2.1 ) 2.1 (100.0 ) % Income before provision for income taxes 587.5 642.1 (54.6 ) (8.5 ) % Provision for income taxes (181.5 ) (222.3 ) 40.8 (18.4 ) % Effective tax rate(b) 30.9 % 34.6 % Net income $ 406.0 $ 419.8 $ (13.8 ) (3.3 ) % Net income per common share Basic $ 4.09 $ 4.10 $ (0.01 ) (0.2 ) % Net income per common share Diluted $ 4.01 $ 3.99 $ 0.02 0.5 % (a) Includes total depreciation expense of $164.2 million and $154.1 million for Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2008, respectively. (b) Effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before provision for income taxes. NM Not meaningful. Net Revenues. Net revenues increased by $138.8 million, or 2.8%, to $5.019 billion in Fiscal 2009 from $4.880 billion in Fiscal 2008. The increase was principally due to growth in our global Wholesale business, increased global Retail sales, and net favorable foreign currency effects. Excluding the effect of foreign currency, net revenues increased by 2.2%. On a reported basis, Wholesale revenues increased by $129.1 million, primarily as a result of the inclusion of a full year of revenues from the newly launched American Living product line and increased revenues from our European and Japanese businesses, offset in part by decreased sales in our core domestic product lines. Retail revenues increased by $23.9 million primarily as a result of continued global store expansion and growth in RalphLauren.com sales, partially offset by a net decline in comparable store sales. Licensing revenue decreased by $14.2 million, primarily due to a decrease in international licensing royalties as a result of the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition (see Recent Developments for further discussion). 39 Table of Contents Net revenues for our three business segments are provided below: Fiscal Years Ended March 28, March 29, 2009 2008 $ Change % Change (millions) Net Revenues: Wholesale $ 2,887.2 $ 2,758.1 $ 129.1 4.7 % Retail 1,936.5 1,912.6 23.9 1.2 % Licensing 195.2 209.4 (14.2 ) (6.8 ) % Total net revenues $ 5,018.9 $ 4,880.1 $ 138.8 2.8 % Wholesale net revenues The net increase primarily reflects: a $74 million net increase in our European businesses on a constant currency basis driven by increased sales in our menswear, womenswear and childrenswear product lines, partially offset by an increase in promotional activity; a $47 million net increase in our Japanese operations on a constant currency basis primarily as a result of the inclusion of revenues from the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition (see Recent Developments for further discussion), offset in part by sales declines in our core businesses; and a $37 million net increase in revenues due to a favorable foreign currency effect related to the strengthening of the Yen, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency effect related to the weakening of the Euro, both in comparison to the U.S. dollar in Fiscal 2009. The above increases were partially offset by: a $29 million aggregate net decrease in our domestic businesses primarily due to reduced shipments across our core menswear, womenswear and childrenswear product lines as a result of the ongoing challenging U.S. retail environment (as discussed further in the Overview section). Offsetting this decrease was the inclusion of a full year of revenues from the newly launched American Living product line and an increase in footwear sales largely attributable to increased door penetration. Retail net revenues For purposes of the discussion of Retail operating performance below, we refer to the measure comparable store sales. Comparable store sales refer to the growth of sales in stores that are open for at least one full fiscal year. Sales for stores that are closing during a fiscal year are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. Sales for stores that are either relocated, enlarged (as defined by gross square footage expansion of 25% or greater) or closed for 30 or more consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales until such stores have been in their location or in a newly renovated state for at least one full fiscal year. Comparable store sales information includes both Ralph Lauren (including Rugby) and Club Monaco stores. The net increase in Retail net revenues primarily reflects: an $81 million aggregate net increase in sales from non comparable stores, primarily relating to new store openings within the past twelve months. There was a net increase in average global store count of 21 stores, to a total of 326 stores, as compared to the prior fiscal year. The net increase in store count was primarily due to a number of new domestic and international full price and factory store openings; and a $27 million, or 18.7%, increase in RalphLauren.com sales. The above increases were partially offset by: an $84 million aggregate net decrease in comparable store sales driven by our global full price stores, including an aggregate net unfavorable foreign currency effect of $13 million primarily related to the 40 Table of Contents weakening of the Euro in comparison to the U.S. dollar in Fiscal 2009. Comparable store sales are provided below: Fiscal Year Ended March 28, 2009 Decreases in comparable store sales as reported: Full price Ralph Lauren store sales (12.4 )% Full price Club Monaco store sales (9.7 )% Factory store sales (1.5 )% Total decrease in comparable store sales as reported (5.2 )% Decreases in comparable store sales excluding the effect of foreign currency: Full price Ralph Lauren store sales (11.6 )% Full price Club Monaco store sales (9.7 )% Factory store sales (0.6 )% Total decrease in comparable store sales excluding the effect of foreign currency (4.4 )% Licensing revenue The net decrease primarily reflects: a $17 million decrease in international licensing royalties, primarily due to the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition (see Recent Developments for further discussion). The above decrease was partially offset by: a $3 million increase in domestic licensing royalties, primarily driven by increases in mens personal apparel and the inclusion of a full year of royalties for American Living. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in fragrance related royalties. Gross Profit. Cost of goods sold includes the expenses incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale, including product costs, freight in, and import costs, as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory realizability. The costs of selling merchandise, including those associated with preparing the merchandise for sale, such as picking, packing, warehousing and order charges, are included in SGA expenses. Gross profit increased by $92.6 million, or 3.5%, to $2.731 billion in Fiscal 2009 from $2.638 billion in Fiscal 2008. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased by 30 basis points to 54.4% in Fiscal 2009 from 54.1% in Fiscal 2008, primarily driven by the growth of our European and Japanese wholesale operations, as well as the net decrease of unfavorable purchase accounting effects associated with prior business acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by increased markdown activity and higher reductions in the carrying cost of our retail inventory, largely as a result of the current economic downturn. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in material costs. These factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SGA expenses primarily include compensation and benefits, marketing, distribution, bad debts, information technology, facilities, legal and other costs associated with finance and administration. SGA expenses increased by $103.5 million, or 5.4%, to $2.036 billion in Fiscal 2009 from $1.932 billion in Fiscal 2008. The increase included a net unfavorable foreign currency effect of approximately $14 million, primarily related to the strengthening of the Yen, partially offset by the weakening of the Euro, both in comparison to the U.S. dollar in Fiscal 2009. SGA expenses as a percent of net revenues increased to 40.6% in Fiscal 2009 from 39.6% in Fiscal 2008. The 100 basis point increase was primarily driven by increased 41 Table of Contents operating expenses attributable to our new business initiatives. The $103.5 million increase in SGA expenses was primarily driven by: the inclusion of SGA costs of approximately $38 million related to our newly acquired Japanese Childrenswear and Golf operations, including costs incurred pursuant to transition service arrangements (see Recent Developments for further discussion); higher compensation related expenses of approximately $35 million principally relating to increased selling costs associated with higher retail sales and our ongoing product line expansion, including American Living and a dedicated dress business across multiple brands. These increases were partially offset by lower stock based compensation expense largely driven by a decrease in the Companys share price as of the date of its annual equity award grant in the second quarter of Fiscal 2009 compared to the share price as of the comparable grant date in Fiscal 2008; an approximate $29 million increase in rent and utility costs to support the ongoing global growth of our businesses, including rent expense related to certain retail stores scheduled to open in Fiscal 2010; an approximate $12 million net increase in litigation related charges, including approximately $4 million related to the reversal of a reserve for credit card matters in Fiscal 2008; and an approximate $11 million increase in bad debt expenses due largely to the negative effects of the slowdown in the global economy on the financial condition and liquidity of our customer base. The above increases were partially offset by: an approximate $20 million decrease in brand related marketing and advertising costs primarily as a result of the implementation of related cost savings initiatives in response to the current economic downturn, as well as the absence of costs associated with the Companys 40th Anniversary celebration in Fiscal 2008. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets decreased by $27.0 million, or 57.2%, to $20.2 million in Fiscal 2009 from $47.2 million in Fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of the amortization of the licenses acquired in the Japanese Business Acquisitions, which were fully amortized by the end of Fiscal 2008. See Recent Developments for further discussion of the acquisitions. Impairments of Assets. An aggregate non cash impairment charge of $55.4 million was recognized in Fiscal 2009, compared to $5.0 million in Fiscal 2008. These charges reduced the net carrying values of certain long lived assets, primarily in the Companys Retail segment, to their estimated fair values. These impairment charges were primarily attributable to lower than expected operating performances in certain stores, which in Fiscal 2009, arose in large part due to the significant contraction in consumer spending experienced during the latter half of that fiscal year. See Note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Restructuring Charges. Restructuring charges of $23.6 million were recognized in Fiscal 2009 primarily associated with a restructuring plan initiated during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 to better align the Companys cost base with lower sales and operating margin trends associated with the recent slowdown in consumer spending, and to improve overall operating effectiveness (the Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan). This Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan included a reduction in workforce and the closure of certain underperforming retail stores. No restructuring charges were recorded in Fiscal 2008. See Note 12 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Operating Income. Operating income decreased by $57.9 million, or 8.9%, to $595.5 million in Fiscal 2009 from $653.4 million in Fiscal 2008. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues decreased 150 basis points to 11.9% in Fiscal 2009 from 13.4% in Fiscal 2008. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net revenues primarily reflected increases in SGA expenses, and $79.0 million of pretax charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets, as previously discussed. 42 Table of Contents Operating income as reported for our three business segments is provided below: Fiscal Years Ended March 28, March 29, 2009 2008 $ Change % Change (millions) Operating Income: Wholesale $ 613.3 $ 565.4 $ 47.9 8.5 % Retail 108.2 204.2 (96.0 ) (47.0 ) % Licensing 103.6 96.7 6.9 7.1 % 825.1 866.3 (41.2 ) (4.8 ) % Less: Unallocated corporate expenses (206.5 ) (217.0 ) 10.5 (4.8 ) % Unallocated legal and restructuring charges (23.1 ) 4.1 (27.2 ) (663.4 ) % Total operating income $ 595.5 $ 653.4 $ (57.9 ) (8.9 ) % Wholesale operating income increased by $47.9 million primarily as a result of higher revenues, as well as improved gross margin largely driven by our European and Japanese wholesale operations. The increase also was due to the net decrease of unfavorable purchase accounting effects primarily associated with prior business acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by higher SGA expenses attributable largely to our new business initiatives. Retail operating income decreased by $96.0 million primarily as a result of $47.0 million of higher impairment related charges, higher reductions in the carrying cost of our retail inventory, and higher rent and occupancy costs. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenues and the absence of certain unfavorable purchase accounting effects associated with the RL Media Minority Interest Acquisition included in the prior fiscal year. Licensing operating income increased by $6.9 million primarily as a result of a decrease in amortization of intangible assets due to the absence of the amortization of the license acquired in the Japanese Business Acquisitions, which was fully amortized by the end of Fiscal 2008. Also contributing to the increased operating income was an increase in domestic licensing royalties, primarily driven by the inclusion of royalties for American Living. These increases were offset in part by a net decrease in international royalties primarily due to the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition (see Recent Developments for further discussion). Unallocated corporate expenses decreased by $10.5 million primarily as a result of a decrease in brand related marketing and advertising costs, as well as lower stock based compensation expense, as previously discussed. Unallocated legal and restructuring charges of $23.1 million in Fiscal 2009 were comprised of restructuring charges of $23.6 million primarily associated with the Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan, as previously discussed, offset by a reversal of an excess reserve in the amount of $0.5 million related to the Credit Card Matter (as discussed in Note 16 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements). In Fiscal 2008, unallocated legal and restructuring charges were comprised of a reversal of an excess reserve in the amount of $4.1 million related to the Credit Card Matter. Foreign Currency Gains (Losses). The effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a gain of $1.6 million in Fiscal 2009, compared to a loss of $6.4 million in Fiscal 2008. The prior fiscal year loss included a $1.6 million write off of foreign currency option contracts, entered into to manage certain foreign currency exposure associated with the Japanese Business Acquisitions, which expired unexercised. Excluding the aforementioned transaction, foreign currency gains increased in Fiscal 2009 as compared to Fiscal 2008, primarily due to the timing of the settlement of intercompany receivables and payables (that were not of a long term investment nature) between certain of our international and domestic subsidiaries. Foreign currency gains and losses are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. 43 Table of Contents Interest Expense. Interest expense includes the borrowing costs of our outstanding debt, including amortization of debt issuance costs, and interest related to our capital lease obligations. Interest expense increased by $0.9 million, to $26.6 million in Fiscal 2009 from $25.7 million in Fiscal 2008. This increase is primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to capital lease obligations, offset in part by a decrease in interest expense related to borrowings under a one year term loan agreement repaid by the Company in May 2008. Interest and Other Income, net. Interest and other income, net, decreased by $2.7 million, to $22.0 million in Fiscal 2009 from $24.7 million in Fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily driven by lower yields relating to lower market rates of interest in Fiscal 2009, offset in part by an increase in our average balance of cash and short term investments during Fiscal 2009. Equity in Income (Loss) of Equity Method Investees. The equity in loss of equity method investees of $5.0 million in Fiscal 2009 and $1.8 million in Fiscal 2008 primarily related to certain start up costs associated with the recently formed joint venture, the RL Watch Company, which the Company accounts for under the equity method of accounting. Minority Interest Expense. Minority interest expense of $2.1 million in Fiscal 2008 related to the Companys remaining 50% interest in PRL Japan, which was acquired in May 2007, and the allocation of Impact 21s net income to the holders of the 80% interest not owned by the Company prior to the closing date of the related acquisition. No minority interest expense was recorded in Fiscal 2009 as both of these companies are now wholly owned. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased by $40.8 million, or 18.4%, to $181.5 million in Fiscal 2009 from $222.3 million in Fiscal 2008. The decrease in provision for income taxes was principally due to an overall decrease in pretax income in Fiscal 2009 compared to Fiscal 2008. This decrease also was due to a reduction in our reported effective tax rate of 370 basis points, to 30.9% in Fiscal 2009 from 34.6% in Fiscal 2008. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to a shift in the geographic mix of earnings. In particular, there was a greater proportion of earnings generated in lower taxed jurisdictions and the tax benefits associated with the asset impairment and restructuring charges were recognized in higher taxed jurisdictions. The effective tax rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses. Our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on non recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and amount of foreign dividends, enacted tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax audit findings and settlements, and the interaction of various global tax strategies. Net Income. Net income decreased by $13.8 million, or 3.3%, to $406.0 million in Fiscal 2009 from $419.8 million in Fiscal 2008. The decrease in net income principally related to a $57.9 million decrease in operating income, offset in part by a $40.8 million decrease in the provision for income taxes, as previously discussed. These results were negatively impacted by $79.0 million of pretax charges recognized in Fiscal 2009 related to asset impairments and restructurings, which had an aggregate effect of reducing net income in Fiscal 2009 by $49.7 million. Net Income Per Diluted Share. Net income per diluted share increased by $0.02, or 0.5%, to $4.01 per share in Fiscal 2009 from $3.99 per share in Fiscal 2008, as the effect of lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding was mostly offset by the decrease in net income in Fiscal 2009. These results were negatively impacted by $79.0 million of pretax charges recognized in Fiscal 2009 related to asset impairments and restructurings, which had an aggregate effect of reducing net income per diluted share in Fiscal 2009 by $0.49. 44 Table of Contents Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 The following table summarizes our results of operations and expresses the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain financial statement captions: Fiscal Years Ended March 29, March 31, 2008 2007 $ Change % Change (millions, except per share data) Net revenues $ 4,880.1 $ 4,295.4 $ 584.7 13.6 % Cost of goods sold(a) (2,242.0 ) (1,959.2 ) (282.8 ) 14.4 % Gross profit 2,638.1 2,336.2 301.9 12.9 % Gross profit as % of net revenues 54.1 % 54.4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses(a) (1,932.5 ) (1,663.4 ) (269.1 ) 16.2 % SGA as % of net revenues 39.6 % 38.7 % Amortization of intangible assets (47.2 ) (15.6 ) (31.6 ) 202.6 % Impairments of assets (5.0 ) (5.0 ) NM Restructuring charges (4.6 ) 4.6 (100.0 ) % Operating income 653.4 652.6 0.8 0.1 % Operating income as % of net revenues 13.4 % 15.2 % Foreign currency gains (losses) (6.4 ) (1.5 ) (4.9 ) 326.7 % Interest expense (25.7 ) (21.6 ) (4.1 ) 19.0 % Interest and other income, net 24.7 26.1 (1.4 ) (5.4 ) % Equity in income (loss) of equity method investees (1.8 ) 3.0 (4.8 ) (160.0 ) % Minority interest expense (2.1 ) (15.3 ) 13.2 (86.3 ) % Income before provision for income taxes 642.1 643.3 (1.2 ) (0.2 ) % Provision for income taxes (222.3 ) (242.4 ) 20.1 (8.3 ) % Effective tax rate(b) 34.6 % 37.7 % Net income $ 419.8 $ 400.9 $ 18.9 4.7 % Net income per common share Basic $ 4.10 $ 3.84 $ 0.26 6.8 % Net income per common share Diluted $ 3.99 $ 3.73 $ 0.26 7.0 % (a) Includes total depreciation expense of $154.1 million and $129.1 million for Fiscal 2008 and Fiscal 2007, respectively. (b) Effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before provision for income taxes. NM Not meaningful. Net Revenues. Net revenues increased by $584.7 million, or 13.6%, to $4.880 billion in Fiscal 2008 from $4.295 billion in Fiscal 2007. The increase was driven by a combination of organic growth, acquisitions and favorable foreign currency effects. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, net revenues increased by $371.2 million, or 8.6%. On a reported basis, Wholesale revenues increased by $442.2 million primarily as a result of incremental revenues from the newly acquired Impact 21 and Small Leathergoods businesses, the inclusion of revenues from the initial shipments of the American Living product line to JCPenney and increased sales in our global menswear and womenswear product lines, primarily driven by strong performance in Europe. The increase in net revenues also was driven by an increase of $169.4 million in our Retail segment revenues as a result of an increase in comparable global retail store sales, continued global store expansion and growth in RalphLauren.com sales. The increase in net revenues was partially offset by a decrease of $26.9 million in licensing revenue, primarily due to a decrease in 45 Table of Contents international licensing royalties as a result of the loss of licensing revenues from Impact 21, which is now consolidated as part of the Wholesale segment. Also contributing to the decrease in licensing revenue was a net decrease in domestic licensing royalties, primarily due to the absence of approximately $8 million of minimum royalty and design service fees received in connection with the termination of a licensing arrangement in the prior fiscal year. Net revenues for our three business segments are provided below: Fiscal Years Ended March 29, March 31, 2008 2007 $ Change % Change (millions) Net Revenues: Wholesale $ 2,758.1 $ 2,315.9 $ 442.2 19.1 % Retail 1,912.6 1,743.2 169.4 9.7 % Licensing 209.4 236.3 (26.9 ) (11.4 ) % Total net revenues $ 4,880.1 $ 4,295.4 $ 584.7 13.6 % Wholesale net revenues The net increase primarily reflects: the inclusion of $254 million of revenues from the newly acquired Impact 21 and Small Leathergoods businesses, net of intercompany eliminations; an approximate $47 million increase in our European businesses on a constant currency basis driven by increased sales in our menswear and womenswear product lines; an aggregate $81 million net increase in our U.S. businesses. The net increase was primarily due to the initial shipments of the American Living product line to JCPenney; an increase in our menswear shipments; a net increase in womenswear, primarily driven by Chaps, partially offset by increased promotional activity; and an increase in footwear attributable to increased door penetration. Offsetting these increases were a decline in our childrenswear product lines due to weaker sales at department stores and increased promotional activity; and a planned reduction in our off price channel denim business; and a $60 million increase in revenues due to a favorable foreign currency effect, primarily related to the continued strengthening of the Euro in comparison to the U.S. dollar in Fiscal 2008. Retail net revenues The increase primarily reflects: a $87 million aggregate net increase in comparable full price and factory store sales on a global basis, including a net aggregate favorable $22 million foreign currency effect. This net increase was driven by increases in comparable store sales as provided below: Fiscal Year Ended March 29, 2008 Increases in comparable store sales as reported: Full price Ralph Lauren store sales 6.6 % Full price Club Monaco store sales 5.7 % Factory store sales 5.5 % Total increase in comparable store sales as reported 5.8 % Increases in comparable store sales excluding the effect of foreign currency: Full price Ralph Lauren store sales 4.3 % Full price Club Monaco store sales 5.7 % Factory store sales 4.2 % Total increase in comparable store sales excluding the effect of foreign currency 4.3 % 46 Table of Contents a $52 million aggregate net increase in sales from non comparable stores, primarily relating to new store openings within the past fiscal year. There was a net increase in average global store count of 9 stores, to a total of 313 stores, compared to the prior fiscal year. The net increase in store count was primarily due to several new domestic and international full price and factory store openings; and a $30 million, or 26.4%, increase in sales at RalphLauren.com. Licensing revenue The net decrease primarily reflects: a $26 million net decrease in international licensing royalties, primarily due to the loss of licensing revenues from Impact 21, which is now consolidated as part of the Wholesale segment; and a $1 million net decrease in domestic licensing royalties, primarily due to the absence of approximately $8 million of minimum royalty and design service fees received in connection with the termination of a licensing arrangement in the prior fiscal year. The net decrease was partially offset by an increase in eyewear related royalties as a result of the licensing agreement entered into with Luxottica Group, S.p.A. and affiliates, which took effect on January 1, 2007. Gross Profit. Cost of goods sold includes the expenses incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale, including product costs, freight in, and import costs, as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory realizability. The costs of selling merchandise, including those associated with preparing the merchandise for sale, such as picking, packing, warehousing and order charges, are included in SGA expenses. Gross profit increased by $301.9 million, or 12.9%, to $2.638 billion in Fiscal 2008 from $2.336 billion in Fiscal 2007. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues decreased by 30 basis points to 54.1% in Fiscal 2008 from 54.4% in Fiscal 2007, primarily due to the dilutive effect of our recent acquisitions. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, gross profit increased by $208.6 million, or 8.9%, and gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased 10 basis points compared to Fiscal 2007. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was due to improved performance in our European wholesale operations which generally carry higher margins, offset in part by increased domestic promotional activity as well as a slight change in the overall relative sales mix between the Wholesale segment and the higher margin Retail and Licensing segments. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in material costs. These factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SGA expenses primarily include compensation and benefits, marketing, distribution, bad debts, information technology, facilities, legal and other costs associated with finance and administration. SGA expenses increased by $269.1 million, or 16.2%, to $1.932 billion in Fiscal 2008 from $1.663 billion in Fiscal 2007. The increase included approximately $36 million of unfavorable foreign currency effects, primarily related to the continued strengthening of the Euro in comparison to the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2008. SGA expenses as a percent of net revenues increased to 39.6% in Fiscal 2008 from 38.7% in Fiscal 2007. The net 90 basis point increase was primarily associated with operating expenses at the Companys newly acquired businesses and certain start up costs related to new business launches. The $269.1 million increase in SGA expenses was primarily driven by: the inclusion of SGA costs of approximately $91 million for our newly acquired Impact 21 and Small Leathergoods businesses, including costs incurred pursuant to transition service arrangements; higher stock based compensation expense of approximately $27 million primarily due to an increase in the Companys share price as of the date of its annual equity award grant in the second quarter of Fiscal 2008 compared to the share price as of the comparable grant date in Fiscal 2007; higher compensation related expenses (excluding stock based compensation) of approximately $56 million, principally relating to increased selling costs associated with higher retail and wholesale sales and our ongoing product line expansion, including American Living and a dedicated dress business across multiple brands, as well as severance related costs; 47 Table of Contents an approximate $39 million increase in rent and utility costs to support the ongoing global growth of our businesses, including rent expense related to certain retail stores scheduled to open in Fiscal 2009; and an approximate $25 million increase in depreciation expense primarily associated with global retail store expansion, construction and renovation of department store shop within shops and investments in our facilities and technological infrastructure. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets increased by $31.6 million, to $47.2 million in Fiscal 2008 from $15.6 million in Fiscal 2007. The net increase was primarily due to the amortization of intangible assets acquired in connection with the Companys recent acquisitions. See Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the acquisitions. Impairments of Assets. A non cash impairment charge of $5.0 million was recognized in Fiscal 2008 to reduce the carrying value of certain long lived assets in the Companys Retail segment to their estimated fair value. The impairment was primarily attributable to lower than expected operating cash flow performance in certain stores. No impairment charges were recognized in Fiscal 2007. See Note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Restructuring Charges. Restructuring charges of $4.6 million were recognized in Fiscal 2007 primarily associated with the Club Monaco retail business. No significant restructuring charges were recognized in Fiscal 2008. See Note 12 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Operating Income. Operating income increased slightly by $0.8 million, or 0.1%, to $653.4 million in Fiscal 2008 from $652.6 million in Fiscal 2007. Operating income as a percentage of revenue decreased 180 basis points, to 13.4% in Fiscal 2008 from 15.2% in Fiscal 2007, primarily due to the effect of purchase accounting relating to the acquisitions. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, operating income increased by $43.0 million, or 6.6%, while operating income as a percentage of net revenues decreased 30 basis points in Fiscal 2008. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net revenues primarily reflected the increase in SGA expenses due to business expansion, partially offset by an increase in gross profit margin as previously discussed. Operating income as reported for our three business segments is provided below: Fiscal Years Ended March 29, March 31, 2008 2007 $ Change % Change (millions) Operating Income: Wholesale $ 565.4 $ 477.8 $ 87.6 18.3 % Retail 204.2 224.2 (20.0 ) (8.9 ) % Licensing 96.7 141.6 (44.9 ) (31.7 ) % 866.3 843.6 22.7 2.7 % Less: Unallocated corporate expenses (217.0 ) (183.4 ) (33.6 ) 18.3 % Unallocated legal and restructuring charges 4.1 (7.6 ) 11.7 (153.9 ) % Total operating income $ 653.4 $ 652.6 $ 0.8 0.1 % Wholesale operating income increased by $87.6 million, including the favorable effects from the Japanese Business and Small Leathergoods Business Acquisitions. Excluding the effects of these acquisitions, Wholesale operating income increased by $61.4 million primarily as a result of increased net sales, including shipments of American Living, and improved gross margin primarily in our European wholesale operations, offset in part by increased domestic promotional activity in certain product categories. The increase was partially offset by higher net SGA expenses in support of our new product lines. Retail operating income decreased by $20.0 million, including the unfavorable effects from purchase accounting related to the RL Media Minority Interest Acquisition. Excluding the effects of the acquisition, Retail operating income decreased by $9.0 million primarily as a result of increased markdown activity, a non cash 48 Table of Contents impairment charge of $5.0 million, and an increase in occupancy and other operating costs principally related to worldwide store expansion, as we continue to develop and invest in our existing retail concepts and formats. The decrease also reflected an increase in selling related salaries and associated costs, as well as increased fulfillment costs associated with higher sales at RalphLauren.com. Licensing operating income decreased by $44.9 million, including the unfavorable effects from the Japanese Business and Small Leathergoods Business Acquisitions. Excluding the effects of these acquisitions, Licensing operating income increased by $12.5 million primarily due to an increase in eyewear related royalties. This increase was partially offset by the absence of approximately $8 million of minimum royalty and design service fees received in connection with the termination of a licensing arrangement in the prior fiscal year. Unallocated corporate expenses increased by $33.6 million, primarily as a result of increases in brand related marketing costs, including costs associated with various events related to the Companys 40th anniversary, and compensation related and facilities costs to support the ongoing growth of our businesses. The increase in compensation related costs includes higher stock based compensation expense and severance related costs, as previously discussed under SGA expenses. Unallocated legal and restructuring charges were comprised of a reversal of an excess reserve in the amount of $4.1 million in Fiscal 2008 related to the Credit Card Matter (as discussed in Note 16 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements). Unallocated legal and restructuring charges were $7.6 million in Fiscal 2007 and were principally associated with the Club Monaco Restructuring Plan charges of $4.0 million (as defined in Note 12 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements) and costs of $3.0 million related to the Credit Card Matter. Foreign Currency Gains (Losses). The effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss of $6.4 million in Fiscal 2008, compared to a loss of $1.5 million in Fiscal 2007. Foreign currency losses increased compared to the prior fiscal year primarily due to a $2.0 million write off of foreign currency option contracts, entered into to manage certain foreign currency exposures associated with the Japanese Business Acquisitions, most of which expired unexercised as of March 29, 2008, hedge activity associated with the return of capital from a foreign subsidiary and intercompany royalty activity, as well as the timing of the settlement of third party and intercompany receivables and payables (that were not of a long term investment nature). Foreign currency gains and losses are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. Interest Expense. Interest expense includes the borrowing costs of our outstanding debt, including amortization of debt issuance costs, and interest related to our capital lease obligations. Interest expense increased by $4.1 million to $25.7 million in Fiscal 2008 from $21.6 million in Fiscal 2007. The increase is primarily due to additional borrowings undertaken during the first quarter of Fiscal 2008 in connection with the Japanese Business Acquisitions (see Financial Condition and Liquidity Debt and Covenant Compliance for further discussion), as well as the higher principal amount of our outstanding Euro denominated debt. This increase was partially offset by the absence of overlapping interest on debt during the period between the issuance of approximately 300 million principal amount of 4.5% notes due October 4, 2013 (the Euro Debt) and the repayment of approximate 227 million principal amount of 6.125% notes outstanding that were due on November 22, 2006, from an original issuance of 275 million in 1999 (the 1999 Euro Debt), in the prior fiscal year. Interest and Other Income, net. Interest and other income, net, decreased by $1.4 million, to $24.7 million in Fiscal 2008 from $26.1 million in Fiscal 2007. This decrease was principally driven by lower average interest rates, lower balances on our invested excess cash and higher transaction related costs. Equity in Income (Loss) of Equity Method Investees. The equity in loss of equity method investees of $1.8 million in Fiscal 2008 related to certain start up costs associated with the recently formed joint venture, RL Watch Company, which the Company accounts for under the equity method of accounting. The equity in income of equity method investees of $3.0 million in Fiscal 2007 related to Impact 21, which was previously accounted for as an equity method investment. The results of operations for Impact 21 have been consolidated in the Companys results of operations commencing April 1, 2007. Accordingly, no equity income related to Impact 21 was recorded in Fiscal 2008. See Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Companys Impact 21 Acquisition. 49 Table of Contents Minority Interest Expense. Minority interest expense decreased by $13.2 million, to $2.1 million in Fiscal 2008 from $15.3 million in Fiscal 2007. The decrease is related to the Companys acquisition of the remaining 50% interests in RL Media and PRL Japan. This decrease was partially offset by an increase related to the allocation of Impact 21s net income to the holders of the approximate 80% interest not owned by the Company prior to the closing date of the related tender offer and to the holders of the remaining approximate 3% interest not owned by the Company as of the end of Fiscal 2008. See Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Companys acquisitions. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased by $20.1 million, or 8.3%, to $222.3 million in Fiscal 2008 from $242.4 million in Fiscal 2007. This decrease was primarily due to a decrease in our reported effective tax rate of 310 basis points, to 34.6% in Fiscal 2008 from 37.7% in Fiscal 2007, and a decrease in pretax income in Fiscal 2008 compared to Fiscal 2007. The lower effective tax rate is primarily due to tax reserve reductions associated with an audit settlement and the expiration of a statute of limitations, lower state income taxes as well as a change in the geographic mix of earnings, partially offset by certain higher, non deductible expenses under 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code. The effective tax rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses. Our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on non recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and amount of foreign dividends, enacted tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax audit findings and settlements, and the interaction of various global tax strategies. See Note 13 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the Companys adoption of FIN 48 as of the beginning of Fiscal 2008. Net Income. Net income increased by $18.9 million, or 4.7%, to $419.8 million in Fiscal 2008 from $400.9 million in Fiscal 2007. The increase in net income principally related to the $20.1 million decrease in provision for income taxes discussed above and the $0.8 million increase in operating income. The increase was partially offset by reductions in operating income primarily related to the dilutive effect of purchase accounting, an increase in domestic promotional activity and higher SGA expenses principally associated with our recent acquisitions. The net dilutive effect related to the Companys recent acquisitions included approximately $53 million of non cash amortization of intangible assets and inventory. See Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Companys acquisitions. Net Income Per Diluted Share. Net income per diluted share increased by $0.26, or 7.0%, to $3.99 per share in Fiscal 2008 from $3.73 per share in Fiscal 2007. The increase in diluted per share results was primarily due to the higher level of net income and lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding for Fiscal 2008 compared to the prior fiscal year.

Net debt is defined as total debt less total cash and cash equivalents and short term investments. 50 Table of Contents The increase to the Companys net cash and short term investments position as of March 28, 2009 as compared to a net debt position as of March 29, 2008 was primarily due to growth in operating cash flows, partially offset by the Companys use of cash to support its treasury stock repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisition spending. In Fiscal 2009, the Company used $169.8 million to repurchase 2.5 million shares of Class A common stock and spent $185.0 million for capital expenditures. The Company also used approximately $26.0 million to fund its recent Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition. In addition, the Company repaid its current maturities of debt using available cash on hand in May 2008. The increase in the Companys short term investments was primarily due to the investment of excess cash in time deposits with maturities greater than 90 days. The increase in stockholders equity was primarily due to the Companys net income in Fiscal 2009, offset in part by an increase in treasury stock as a result of the Companys common stock repurchase program. Cash Flows Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Fiscal Years Ended March 28, March 29, 2009 2008 $ Change (millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 774.2 $ 695.4 $ 78.8 Net cash used in investing activities (458.0 ) (505.0 ) 47.0 Net cash used in financing activities (352.1 ) (260.5 ) (91.6 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (34.4 ) 57.7 (92.1 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (70.3 ) $ (12.4 ) $ (57.9 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $774.2 million in Fiscal 2009, compared to $695.4 million in Fiscal 2008. This net increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by: an increase in net income before depreciation, amortization, non cash asset impairment charges, stock based compensation and other non cash expenses; and an approximate $84 million decrease in cash tax payments. The above increases were partially offset by: an increase in inventory primarily due to the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition, offset in part by the effects of ongoing inventory management across most businesses. Other than the items described above, the changes in operating assets and liabilities were attributable to normal operating fluctuations. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $458.0 million in Fiscal 2009, as compared to $505.0 million in Fiscal 2008. The net decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by: a decrease in net cash used to fund the Companys acquisitions. In Fiscal 2009, the Company used $46.3 million primarily to fund the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition and to complete the minority squeeze out related to the Japanese Business Acquisitions. On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2008, the Company used $188.7 million principally to fund the Japanese Business Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and the Small Leathergoods Business Acquisition; a decrease in cash used in connection with capital expenditures. In Fiscal 2009, the Company spent $185.0 million for capital expenditures, as compared to $217.1 million in Fiscal 2008. The Companys capital expenditures were primarily associated with global retail store expansion, construction and 51 Table of Contents renovation of department store shop within shops and investments in its facilities and technological infrastructure; and a change in restricted cash deposits. In Fiscal 2009, net restricted cash of $26.9 million was released primarily in connection with the partial settlement of certain international tax matters. On a comparative basis, Fiscal 2008 included net restricted cash deposits of $15.1 million. The above decreases were partially offset by: an increase in cash used to purchase investments, less proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. In Fiscal 2009, the Company used $623.1 million to purchase investments, less $369.5 million of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2008, $96.8 million was used to purchase investments, less $12.7 million of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $352.1 million in Fiscal 2009, as compared to $260.5 million in Fiscal 2008. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by: the repayment of 20.5 billion ($196.8 million as of the repayment date) of borrowings under a one year term loan agreement pursuant to an amendment and restatement to the Companys existing credit facility (the Term Loan) in Fiscal 2009 related to the Japanese Business Acquisitions. On a comparative basis, Fiscal 2008 included the receipt of proceeds from the Term Loan of $168.9 million as of the borrowing date; and a decrease in excess tax benefits from stock based compensation arrangements of $22.3 million in Fiscal 2009 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The above increases were partially offset by: a decrease in repurchases of the Companys Class A common stock pursuant to the Companys common stock repurchase program. Approximately 2.5 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $169.8 million (including approximately 0.4 million shares at a cost of $24.0 million that was traded prior to the end of Fiscal 2008 for which settlement occurred in April 2008) were repurchased in Fiscal 2009, as compared to approximately 6.0 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $475.4 million in Fiscal 2008. Fiscal 2008 Compared to Fiscal 2007 Fiscal Years Ended March 29, March 31, 2008 2007 $ Change (millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 695.4 $ 796.1 $ (100.7 ) Net cash used in investing activities (505.0 ) (434.6 ) (70.4 ) Net cash used in financing activities (260.5 ) (95.2 ) (165.3 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 57.7 11.9 45.8 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (12.4 ) $ 278.2 $ (290.6 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $695.4 million in Fiscal 2008, compared to $796.1 million in Fiscal 2007. This $100.7 million net decrease in operating cash flow was primarily driven by: the absence of the approximately $180 million, net of certain tax withholdings, received under an eyewear licensing agreement in the prior fiscal year; and an increase in other receivables primarily attributable to the timing of estimated tax payments. 52 Table of Contents The above decreases were partially offset by: an increase in net income before non cash depreciation, amortization and stock based compensation expenses; improved accounts receivable cash collections in the Companys Wholesale segment; and the effects of ongoing inventory management, which resulted in lower average balance and increased inventory turns across certain businesses. Other than the items described above, the changes in operating assets and liabilities were attributable to normal operating fluctuations. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $505.0 million in Fiscal 2008, as compared to $434.6 million in Fiscal 2007. The net increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by: an increase in net cash used to fund the Companys acquisitions. In Fiscal 2008, the Company used $188.7 million principally to fund the Japanese Business Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and the Small Leathergoods Business Acquisition; whereas in Fiscal 2007, $176.1 million was used primarily to fund the RL Media Minority Interest Acquisition; an increase in cash used in connection with capital expenditures. In Fiscal 2008, the Company spent $217.1 million for capital expenditures, as compared to $184.0 million in Fiscal 2007. The increase in capital expenditures is primarily associated with global retail store expansion, construction and renovation of department store shop within shops and investments in our facilities and technological infrastructure, including showrooms related to our new businesses; an increase related to purchases of investments of $96.8 million, less proceeds from sales and maturities of investments of $12.7 million, in Fiscal 2008; and a partially offsetting decrease in restricted cash deposits. During Fiscal 2008, $15.1 million of cash was restricted as compared to $74.5 million during Fiscal 2007. Restricted cash was placed in escrow with certain banks as collateral to secure guarantees of a corresponding amount made by the banks to certain international tax authorities on behalf of the Company. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $260.5 million in Fiscal 2008, as compared to $95.2 million in Fiscal 2007. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by: increased repurchases of the Companys Class A common stock pursuant to the Companys common stock repurchase program. Approximately 6.0 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $475.4 million were repurchased in Fiscal 2008, as compared to approximately 3.5 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $231.3 million in Fiscal 2007; and a partially offsetting increase in proceeds from issuance of debt. Fiscal 2008 included the receipt of proceeds from borrowings of 20.5 billion ($168.9 million as of the borrowing date) under a one year term loan agreement in connection with the Japanese Business Acquisitions. On a comparative basis, Fiscal 2007 included the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of 300 million principal amount ($380.0 million) of Euro Debt, offset in part by the repayment of approximately 227 million principal amount ($291.6 million) of 1999 Euro Debt. Liquidity The Companys primary sources of liquidity are the cash flow generated from its operations, $450 million of availability under its credit facility, available cash and cash equivalents, investments and other available financing options. These sources of liquidity are needed to fund the Companys ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, global retail store expansion, construction and renovation of shop within shops, investment in technological infrastructure, acquisitions, joint ventures, dividends, debt repayment, stock 53 Table of Contents repurchases, contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax positions) and other corporate activities. Notwithstanding the current global economic crisis, management believes that the Companys existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support its operating, capital and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, including the finalization of acquisitions and plans for business expansion. As discussed below under the section entitled Debt and Covenant Compliance, the Company had no revolving credit borrowings outstanding under its credit facility as of March 28, 2009. However, as discussed further below, the Company may elect to draw on its credit facility or other potential sources of financing for, among other things, a material acquisition, settlement of a material contingency (including uncertain tax positions) or a material adverse business development, as well as for other general corporate business purposes. In recognition of the current global economic crisis, the Company believes its credit facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentrations in any one financial institution. In particular, as of March 28, 2009, there were 13 financial institutions participating in the credit facility, with no one participant maintaining a maximum commitment percentage in excess of approximately 20%. Although there can be no assurances, management believes that the participating institutions will be able to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the credit facility in the event of the Companys election to draw funds in the foreseeable future. In May 2007, the Company completed the Japanese Business Acquisitions. These transactions were funded with available cash on hand and the 20.5 billion Term Loan. The Company repaid the borrowing by its maturity date on May 22, 2008 using $196.8 million of Impact 21s cash on hand acquired as part of the acquisition. Common Stock Repurchase Program In May 2008, the Companys Board of Directors approved an expansion of the Companys existing common stock repurchase program that allows the Company to repurchase up to an additional $250 million of Class A common stock. Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are subject to overall business and market conditions. In Fiscal 2009, 1.8 million shares of Class A common stock were repurchased by the Company at a cost of $126.2 million under its repurchase program. Also, during the first quarter of Fiscal 2009, 0.4 million shares traded prior to the end of Fiscal 2008 were settled at a cost of $24.0 million. The remaining availability under the common stock repurchase program was approximately $266 million as of March 28, 2009. In addition, in Fiscal 2009, 0.3 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $19.6 million were surrendered to, or withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under the Companys 1997 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated. In Fiscal 2008, share repurchases amounted to 6.1 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $476.4 million, including $24.0 million (0.4 million shares) that was traded prior to the end of the fiscal year for which settlement occurred in April 2008. In addition, in Fiscal 2008, 0.3 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $23.0 million were surrendered to, or withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under the Companys 1997 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan, as amended and restated. In Fiscal 2007, the Company repurchased 3.5 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $231.3 million. Dividends The Company declared a quarterly dividend of $0.05 per outstanding share in each quarter of Fiscal 2009, Fiscal 2008 and Fiscal 2007. The aggregate amount of dividend payments was $19.9 million in Fiscal 2009, $20.5 million in Fiscal 2008 and $20.9 million in Fiscal 2007. The Company intends to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends on its outstanding common stock. However, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, the Companys results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. 54 Table of Contents Debt and Covenant Compliance Euro Debt The Company has outstanding approximately 300 million principal amount of 4.5% notes due October 4, 2013. The Company has the option to redeem all of the Euro Debt at any time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus a premium. The Company also has the option to redeem all of the Euro Debt at any time at par plus accrued interest in the event of certain developments involving U.S. tax law. Partial redemption of the Euro Debt is not permitted in either instance. In the event of a change of control of the Company, each holder of the Euro Debt has the option to require the Company to redeem the Euro Debt at its principal amount plus accrued interest. The indenture governing the Euro Debt (the Indenture) contains certain limited covenants that restrict the Companys ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur liens or enter into a sale and leaseback transaction for any principal property. The Indenture does not contain any financial covenants. As of March 28, 2009, the carrying value of the Euro Debt was $406.4 million, compared to $472.8 million as of March 29, 2008. The Company may from time to time repurchase all or a portion of its Euro Debt in the open market, via tender offer or otherwise. Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan The Company has a credit facility that provides for a $450 million unsecured revolving line of credit through November 2011 (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility also is used to support the issuance of letters of credit. As of March 28, 2009, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility, and the Company was contingently liable for $13.7 million of outstanding letters of credit (primarily relating to inventory purchase commitments). The Company has the ability to expand its borrowing availability to $600 million subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Companys option, either at (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (i) the prime commercial lending rate of JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect from time to time and (ii) the weighted average overnight Federal funds rate (as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) plus 50 basis points or (b) a LIBOR rate in effect from time to time, as adjusted for the Federal Reserve Boards Euro currency liabilities maximum reserve percentage plus a margin defined in the Credit Facility (the applicable margin). The applicable margin of 35 basis points is subject to adjustment based on the Companys credit ratings. In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate of 8 basis points under the terms of the Credit Facility also is subject to adjustment based on the Companys credit ratings. The Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Companys ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens and contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets, including equity interests; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not in a related line of business; make loans, advances or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make investments. The Credit Facility also requires the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to Consolidated EBITDAR (the leverage ratio) of no greater than 3.75 as of the date of measurement for four consecutive quarters. Adjusted Debt is defined generally as consolidated debt outstanding plus 8 times consolidated rent expense for the last twelve months. EBITDAR is defined generally as consolidated net income plus (i) income tax expense, (ii) net interest expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense and (iv) consolidated rent expense. As of March 28, 2009, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the Credit Facility) has occurred under the Companys Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The Credit Facility specifies a number of events of default (many of which are subject to applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure to make timely principal and interest payments or to satisfy the covenants, including the 55 Table of Contents financial covenant described above. Additionally, the Credit Facility provides that an Event of Default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and related entities controlled by Mr. Lauren fail to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power of the Companys common stock. The Credit Facility was amended and restated as of May 22, 2007 to provide for the addition of the 20.5 billion Term Loan. This loan was made to Polo JP Acqui B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, and was guaranteed by the Company, as well as the other subsidiaries of the Company which currently guarantee the Credit Facility. The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to finance the Japanese Business Acquisitions. Borrowings under the Term Loan bore interest at a fixed rate of 1.2%. The Company repaid the borrowing by its maturity date on May 22, 2008 using $196.8 million of Impact 21s cash on hand acquired as part of the acquisition. See Recent Developments for further discussion of the Japanese Business Acquisitions. Contractual and Other Obligations Firm Commitments The following table summarizes certain of the Companys aggregate contractual obligations as of March 28, 2009, and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on the Companys liquidity and cash flow in future periods. The Company expects to fund the firm commitments with operating cash flow generated in the normal course of business and, if necessary, availability under its $450 million credit facility or other potential sources of financing. Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2015 and 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Thereafter Total (millions) Euro debt $ $ $ 406.4 $ $ 406.4 Capital leases 8.3 18.1 18.0 47.3 91.7 Operating leases 179.9 326.8 294.9 831.0 1,632.6 Inventory purchase commitments 579.3 0.2 579.5 Total $ 767.5 $ 345.1 $ 719.3 $ 878.3 $ 2,710.2 The following is a description of the Companys material, firmly committed contractual obligations as of March 28, 2009: Euro debt represents the principal amount due at maturity of the Companys outstanding Euro Debt on a U.S. dollar equivalent basis. Amounts do not include any fair value adjustments, call premiums or interest payments; Lease obligations represent the minimum lease rental payments under noncancelable leases for the Companys real estate and operating equipment in various locations around the world. Approximately 60% of these lease obligations relates to the Companys retail operations. Information has been presented separately for operating and capital leases. In addition to such amounts, the Company is normally required to pay taxes, insurance and occupancy costs relating to its leased real estate properties; and Inventory purchase commitments represent the Companys legally binding agreements to purchase fixed or minimum quantities of goods at determinable prices. Excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the non current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $154.8 million recognized pursuant to FIN 48. This liability for unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded because the Company cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever. The above table also excludes the following: (i) amounts included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of March 28, 2009 as these items will be paid within one year; and (ii) non current liabilities that have no cash outflows associated with them (e.g., deferred revenue) or the cash outflows associated with them are 56 Table of Contents uncertain or do not represent a purchase obligation as the term is used herein (e.g., deferred taxes and other miscellaneous items). The Company also has certain contractual arrangements that would require it to make payments if certain circumstances occur. See Note 16 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a description of the Companys contingent commitments not included in the above table. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Companys off balance sheet firm commitments, which include outstanding letters of credit and minimum funding commitments to investees, amounted to $19.9 million as of March 28, 2009. In addition, as discussed in Recent Developments, the Company has entered into an agreement to assume direct control of its Polo branded licensed apparel business in Southeast Asia effective January 1, 2010 in exchange for a cash payment of $20.0 million and certain other consideration. The Company does not maintain any other off balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on its financial condition or results of operations. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to a variety of risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain anticipated cash flows from its international operations and possible declines in the fair value of reported net assets of certain of its foreign operations, as well as changes in the fair value of its fixed rate debt relating to changes in interest rates. Consequently, in the normal course of business the Company employs established policies and procedures, including the use of derivative financial instruments, to manage such risks. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other financial factors. The Companys established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk on derivative transactions include reviewing and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. As a result of the above considerations, the Company does not believe it is exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty risk with respect to its derivative contracts as of March 28, 2009. However, the Company does have approximately 48% of its derivative instruments in asset positions placed with one creditworthy financial institution. Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company manages its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts. Refer to Note 15 to the audited consolidated financial statements for a summarization of the notional amounts and fair values of the Companys foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of March 28, 2009. Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts From time to time, the Company may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts as hedges to reduce its risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases, intercompany royalty payments made by certain of its international operations, intercompany contributions made to fund certain marketing efforts of its international operations, interest payments made in connection with outstanding debt, other foreign currency denominated operational obligations including payroll, rent, insurance and benefit payments, and foreign currency denominated revenues. As part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily to changes in the value of the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Swiss Franc, and the British Pound Sterling, the Company hedges a portion of its foreign currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing twelve month to two year periods. In doing so, the Company uses foreign currency exchange contracts that generally have maturities of three months to two years to provide continuing coverage throughout the hedging period. 57 Table of Contents The Companys foreign exchange risk management activities are governed by policies and procedures approved by its Audit Committee and Board of Directors. Our policies and procedures provide a framework that allows for the management of currency exposures while ensuring the activities are conducted within established Company guidelines. Our policies includes guidelines for the organizational structure of our risk management function and for internal controls over foreign exchange risk management activities, including but not limited to authorization levels, transactional limits, and credit quality controls, as well as various measurements for monitoring compliance. We monitor foreign exchange risk using different techniques including a periodic review of market value and sensitivity analyses. The Company records its foreign currency exchange contracts at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at hedge inception are accounted for in accordance with FAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and subsequent amendments (collectively, FAS 133). As such, to the extent these hedges are effective, the related gains (losses) are deferred in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. These deferred gains (losses) are then recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as follows: Forecasted Inventory Purchases Recognized as part of the cost of the inventory being hedged within cost of goods sold when the related inventory is sold. Intercompany Royalty Payments and Marketing Contributions Recognized within foreign currency gains (losses) in the period in which the related royalties or marketing contributions being hedged are received or paid. Operational Obligations Recognized primarily within SGA expenses in the period in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. Interest Payments on Euro Debt Recognized within foreign currency gains (losses) in the period in which the recorded liability impacts earnings due to foreign currency exchange remeasurement. The Company recognized net losses on foreign currency exchange contracts in earnings of approximately $6 million for Fiscal 2009 and $8 million for Fiscal 2008, and a net gain of approximately $4 million for Fiscal 2007. Sensitivity The Company performs a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of the Companys derivative financial instruments. To perform the sensitivity analysis, the Company assesses the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This analysis assumes a like movement by all foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio against the U.S. dollar. Based on all foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of March 28, 2009, a 10% devaluation of the U.S. dollar as compared to the level of foreign currency exchange rates for currencies under contract as of March 28, 2009 would result in approximately $2 million of net unrealized losses. Conversely, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar would result in approximately $2 million of net unrealized gains. As the Companys outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts are primarily designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions, the unrealized loss or gain as a result of a 10% devaluation or appreciation would be largely offset by changes in the underlying hedged items. Hedge of a Net Investment in Certain European Subsidiaries The Company designated the entire principal amount of its outstanding Euro Debt as a hedge of its net investment in certain of its European subsidiaries. As required by FAS 133, the changes in fair value of a derivative instrument or a non derivative financial instrument (such as debt) that is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are reported in the same manner as a translation adjustment under FAS No. 52, Foreign Currency Translation, to the extent it is effective as a hedge. As such, changes in the fair value of the Euro Debt resulting from changes in the Euro exchange rate have been, and continue to be, reported in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company recorded within other comprehensive 58 Table of Contents income the translation effects of the Euro Debt to U.S. dollars, resulting in a gain of $66.6 million for Fiscal 2009, and losses of $73.8 million for Fiscal 2008 and $30.8 million for Fiscal 2007. Interest Rate Risk Management During the first six months of Fiscal 2007, the Company entered into three forward starting interest rate swap contracts in anticipation of the Companys proposed refinancing of the 1999 Euro Debt, which was completed in October 2006. These contracts were designated as cash flow hedges of a forecasted transaction to issue new debt in connection with the planned refinancing. The interest rate swaps hedged a total of 200.0 million, a portion of the underlying interest rate exposure on the anticipated refinancing. Under the terms of the swaps, the Company paid a weighted average fixed rate of interest of 4.1% and received variable interest based on six month EURIBOR. The Company terminated the swaps on September 28, 2006, which was the date the interest rate for the Euro Debt was determined. As a result, the Company made a payment of approximately 3.5 million ($4.4 million) in settlement of the swaps. An amount of $0.2 million was recognized as a loss in Fiscal 2007 due to the partial ineffectiveness of the cash flow hedge as a result of the forecasted transaction closing on October 5, 2006 instead of November 22, 2006 (the maturity date of the 1999 Euro Debt). The remaining loss of $4.2 million was deferred as a component of comprehensive income within stockholders equity and is being recognized in earnings as an adjustment to interest expense over the seven year term of the Euro Debt. No other interest rate related agreements have been entered into since Fiscal 2007. Sensitivity As of March 28, 2009, the Company had no variable rate debt outstanding. As such, the Companys exposure to changes in interest rates primarily related to its fixed rate Euro Debt. As of March 28, 2009, the carrying value of the Euro Debt was $406.4 million and the fair value was $320.0 million. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of the Euro Debt by approximately $3 million. Such potential increases or decreases are based on certain simplifying assumptions, including no changes in Euro currency exchange rates and an immediate across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period. The Term Loan of 20.5 billion made to Polo JP Acqui, B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, was repaid by the Company by its maturity date on May 22, 2008 using $196.8 million of Impact 21s cash on hand acquired as part of the Japanese Business Acquisitions. Investment Risk Management As of March 28, 2009, the Company had cash and cash equivalents on hand of $481.2 million, primarily invested in money market funds and time deposits with maturities of less than 90 days. The Companys other significant investments included $338.7 million of short term investments, primarily in time deposits with maturities greater than 90 days; $71.7 million of restricted cash placed in escrow with certain banks as collateral to secure guarantees in connection with certain international tax matters; $27.1 million of deposits with maturities greater than one year; and $2.3 million of auction rate securities issued through a municipality. The Company evaluates investments held in unrealized loss positions for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. Such evaluation involves a variety of considerations, including assessments of risks and uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers. Factors considered by the Company include (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost, (ii) the financial condition, credit worthiness and near term prospects of the issuer, (iii) the length of time to maturity, (iv) future economic conditions and market forecasts and (v) the Companys intent and ability to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value. The Company limits its exposure by primarily investing in highly rated investments issued by municipalities. 59 Table of Contents CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The SECs Financial Reporting Release No. 60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies (FRR 60), suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the Companys financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimation on the part of management in its application. The Companys estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. The Company believes that the following list represents its critical accounting policies as contemplated by FRR 60. For a discussion of all of the Companys significant accounting policies, see Notes 3 and 4 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements. Sales Reserves and Uncollectible Accounts A significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and net income is estimating sales reserves, which represent that portion of gross revenues not expected to be realized. In particular, wholesale revenue is reduced by estimates of returns, discounts, end of season markdowns and operational chargebacks. Retail revenue, including e commerce sales, also is reduced by estimates of returns. In determining estimates of returns, discounts, end of season markdowns and operational chargebacks, management analyzes historical trends, seasonal results, current economic and market conditions and retailer performance. The Company reviews and refines these estimates on a quarterly basis. The Companys historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. Similarly, management evaluates accounts receivables to determine if they will ultimately be collected. Significant judgments and estimates are involved in this evaluation, including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for larger accounts and customers, and a receivables aging analysis that determines the percentage of receivables that has historically been uncollected by aged category. Based on this information, management provides a reserve for the estimated amounts believed to be uncollectible. Although management believes that it has adequately provided for those risks as part of its bad debt reserve, a severe and prolonged adverse impact on its major customers business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on the Companys net sales, cash flows and or financial condition. See Accounts Receivable in Note 3 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the activity in the Companys sales reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts for each of the three fiscal years presented. Inventories The Company holds inventory that is sold through wholesale distribution channels to major department stores and specialty retail stores, including its own retail stores. The Company also holds retail inventory that is sold in its own stores directly to consumers. Wholesale and retail inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value. Cost for wholesale inventories is determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method and cost for retail inventories is determined on a moving average cost basis. The Company continually evaluates the composition of its inventories, assessing slow turning product and fashion product. Estimated realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of the Companys individual product lines, the impact of market trends and economic conditions, and the value of current orders in house relating to the future sales of inventory. Estimates may differ from actual results due to quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions. The Companys historical estimates of these costs and its provisions have not differed materially from actual results. Reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk over physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts. 60 Table of Contents Purchase Accounting The Company accounts for its business acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting. As such, the total cost of acquisitions is allocated to the underlying net assets based on their respective estimated fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. In addition, in connection with its business acquisitions, the Company evaluates the terms of any pre existing relationships to determine if a settlement of the pre existing relationship exists. These pre existing relationships primarily relate to licensing agreements. In accordance with the Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 04 1, Accounting for Pre existing Relationships between the Parties to a Business Combination, the Company is required to allocate the aggregate consideration exchanged in these transactions between the value of the business acquired and the value of the settlement of any pre existing relationships in proportion to estimates of their respective fair values. If the terms of the pre existing relationships were determined to not be reflective of market, a settlement gain or loss would be recognized in earnings. Accordingly, significant judgment is required to determine the respective fair values of the business acquired and the value of the settlement of the pre existing relationship. The Company has historically utilized independent valuation firms to assist in the determination of fair value. Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (FAS 157 or the Standard). FAS 157 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date within an identified principal or most advantageous market, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with US GAAP and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements through a three level valuation hierarchy. The Company adopted the provisions of FAS 157 for all of its financial assets and liabilities within the Standards scope as of the beginning of Fiscal 2009 (March 30, 2008). The Company uses judgment in the determination of the applicable level within the hierarchy of a particular asset or liability when evaluating the inputs used in valuation as of the measurement date, notably the extent to which the inputs are market based (observable) or internally derived (unobservable). See Notes 4 and 15 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the effect of this accounting change on the Companys consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill and other intangible assets are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of FAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (FAS 142). Under FAS 142, goodwill, including any goodwill included in the carrying value of investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually based on comparisons of their respective fair values to their carrying values. Finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable in accordance with FAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (FAS 144). In accordance with FAS 142, goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired and performance of the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount 61 Table of Contents of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge. To assist management in the process of determining goodwill impairment, the Company reviews and considers appraisals from independent valuation firms. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons and recent transactions. These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting the risks inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables. The impairment test for other indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess. In addition, in evaluating finite lived intangible assets for recoverability, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition in accordance with FAS 144. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value. There have been no impairment losses recorded in connection with the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets during any of the three fiscal years presented. Impairment of Other Long Lived Assets Property and equipment, along with other long lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable in accordance with FAS 144. In evaluating long lived assets for recoverability, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. In determining future cash flows, the Company takes various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the emphasis on retail store cost controls, the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, and the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and increased local advertising. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations. During Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2008, the Company recorded non cash impairment charges of $55.4 million and $5.0 million, respectively, to reduce the net carrying value of certain long lived assets primarily in its Retail segment to their estimated fair value. No impairment charges were recorded in Fiscal 2007. See Note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Income Taxes Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method prescribed by FAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (FAS 109). Under this method, income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets and liabilities, current taxes 62 Table of Contents payable/refunds receivable and tax expense) are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the results of any difference between US GAAP and tax reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating loss, capital loss and general business credit carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. The Company accounts for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates in the period of enactment. In addition, valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments to those balances. Effective April 1, 2007, the Company adopted FIN 48. Upon the adoption of the provisions of FIN 48, the Company changed its policy related to the accounting for income tax uncertainties. If the Company considers that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, it recognizes the tax benefit. The Company measures the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. These assessments can be complex and require significant judgment, and the Company often obtains assistance from external advisors. To the extent that the Companys estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. If the initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, the Company regularly monitors its position and subsequently recognizes the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not, (ii) the statute of limitations expires, or (iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when the Company expects to pay cash within the next twelve months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded within the provision for income taxes in the Companys consolidated statements of operations and are classified on the consolidated balance sheets with the related liability for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 13 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Companys income taxes and the adoption of FIN 48. Contingencies The Company periodically is exposed to various contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting its business, including certain litigations, alleged information system security breach matters, contractual disputes, employee relation matters, various tax audits, and trademark and intellectual property matters and disputes. In accordance with FAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (FAS 5), the Company records a liability for such contingencies to the extent that it concludes their occurrence is probable and the related losses are estimable. In addition, if it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement of a contingency could exceed the established liability, the Company discloses the estimated impact on its liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Management considers many factors in making these assessments. As the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable, these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions. As a result, the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on estimates and assumptions. Stock Based Compensation The Company accounts for stock based compensation arrangements in accordance with FAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment (FAS 123R), which requires all share based payments to employees and non employee directors to be expensed based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. 63 Table of Contents Stock Options Stock options are granted to employees and non employee directors with exercise prices equal to fair market value at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. Certain key assumptions involve estimating future uncertain events. The key factors influencing the estimation process include the expected term of the option, the expected stock price volatility factor, the expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate, among others. Generally, once stock option values are determined, current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from the actuals. Determining the fair value of stock based compensation at the date of grant requires significant judgment by management, including estimates of the above Black Scholes assumptions. In addition, judgment is required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, if management changes its assumptions for future stock based award grants, or if there are changes in market conditions, stock based compensation expense and the Companys results of operations could be materially impacted. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) The Company grants restricted shares of Class A common stock and service based RSUs to certain of its senior executives and non employee directors. In addition, the Company grants performance based RSUs to such senior executives and other key executives, and certain other employees of the Company. The fair values of restricted stock shares and RSUs are based on the fair value of unrestricted Class A common stock, as adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for those restricted securities that are not entitled to dividend equivalents. Compensation expense for performance based RSUs is recognized over the related service period when attainment of the performance goals is deemed probable, which involves judgment on the part of management.
