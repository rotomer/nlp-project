Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. The following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (MDA) should be read together with our audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for Fiscal 2010 (Fiscal 2010 10 K). We utilize a 52 53 week fiscal year ending on the Saturday closest to March 31. As such, fiscal year 2010 ended on April 3, 2010 and reflected a 53 week period (Fiscal 2010); fiscal year 2009 ended on March 28, 2009 and reflected a 52 week period (Fiscal 2009); and fiscal year 2008 ended on March 29, 2008 and also reflected a 52 week period (Fiscal 2008). The inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2010 resulted in incremental revenues of approximately $70 million and increased net income of approximately $13 million. INTRODUCTION MDA is provided as a supplement to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements and footnotes to help provide an understanding of our financial condition and liquidity, changes in financial condition, and results of our operations. MDA is organized as follows: Overview. This section provides a general description of our business, including our objectives and risks, and a summary of financial performance for Fiscal 2010. In addition, this section includes a discussion of recent developments and transactions affecting comparability that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and financial condition, and in anticipating future trends. Results of operations. This section provides an analysis of our results of operations for Fiscal 2010, Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2008. Financial condition and liquidity.

In addition, all of our significant accounting policies, including our critical accounting policies, are summarized in Notes 3 and 4 to our accompanying audited consolidated financial statements. Recently issued accounting standards. This section discusses the potential impact to our reported financial condition and results of operations of accounting standards that have been recently issued. OVERVIEW Our Business Our Company is a global leader in the design, marketing and distribution of premium lifestyle products including mens, womens and childrens apparel, accessories, fragrances and home furnishings. Our long standing 34 Table of Contents reputation and distinctive image have been consistently developed across an expanding number of products, brands and international markets. Our brand names include Polo by Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Ralph Lauren Womens Collection, Black Label, Blue Label, Lauren by Ralph Lauren, RRL, RLX, Rugby, Ralph Lauren Childrenswear, American Living, Chaps and Club Monaco, among others. We classify our businesses into three segments: Wholesale, Retail and Licensing. Our wholesale business (representing approximately 51% of Fiscal 2010 net revenues) consists of wholesale channel sales made principally to major department stores, specialty stores and golf and pro shops located throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. Our retail business (representing approximately 45% of Fiscal 2010 net revenues) consists of retail channel sales directly to consumers through full price and factory retail stores located throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe, South America and Asia, through concessions based shop within shops located primarily in Asia, and through our retail internet sites located at www.RalphLauren.com and www.Rugby.com. In addition, our licensing business (representing approximately 4% of Fiscal 2010 net revenues) consists of royalty based arrangements under which we license the right to third parties to use our various trademarks in connection with the manufacture and sale of designated products, such as apparel, eyewear and fragrances, in specified geographical areas for specified periods. Approximately 30% of our Fiscal 2010 net revenues was earned in international regions outside of the U.S. and Canada. See Note 22 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of net revenues by geographic location. In connection with the closing of the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition (as defined and discussed under Recent Developments) at the beginning of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010, we restated our segment presentation to reclassify concessions based sales arrangements to our Retail segment from our Wholesale segment. Segment information for Fiscal 2009 has been recast to conform to the current periods presentation. In periods prior to Fiscal 2009, segment information has not been recast to conform to the current periods presentation, as it is impracticable to do so. See Note 2 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the restatement of our segment presentation. Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and key vacation travel, back to school and holiday shopping periods in the Retail segment. Our Objectives and Risks Our core strengths include a portfolio of global luxury lifestyle brands, a strong and experienced management team, a proven ability to develop and extend our brands distributed through multiple retail channels in global markets, a disciplined investment philosophy and a solid balance sheet. Despite the various risks associated with the current global economic environment as further discussed below, we believe our core strengths will allow us to continue to execute our strategy for long term sustainable growth in revenue, net income and operating cash flow. Our financial performance has been driven by the Companys focus on six key objectives: Creating unique businesses primarily centered around one core and heritage driven brand; Diversifying and expanding our products and prices, distribution channels and geographic regions; Improving brand control and positioning; Focusing on selective strategic partnerships; Implementing infrastructure improvements that support a worldwide business; and Funding our expansion through strong operating cash flow. As our business has grown, our portfolio mix and brand control has evolved from primarily that of a mono brand U.S. centric menswear wholesaler with a broad array of product and geographic licenses to that of a portfolio of lifestyle brands with a direct control model over most of our brands, products and international territories. We believe that this broader and better diversified portfolio mix positions us for ongoing growth, offering our customers 35 Table of Contents a range of products, price points and channels of distribution, and our size and global operations favorably position us to take advantage of synergies in design, sourcing and distribution. While balancing our long term key strategic objectives with our near term priorities to manage through the many risks associated with the weakened global economic environment and related reduction in consumer spending levels, we intend to continue to pursue select opportunities for growth during the course of Fiscal 2011 and beyond. These opportunities and continued investment initiatives include: International Growth Opportunities Ongoing development and integration of our recently acquired businesses in Asia Pacific, including the continued execution of our plans to enhance our supporting organizational infrastructure and expand our retail businesses. Direct to Consumer Growth Opportunities Global expansion of our direct to consumer presence in various formats and key markets, including e commerce operations in Europe. Product Innovation and Brand Extension Growth Opportunities Further development of a wide array of luxury accessories product offerings, including handbags, footwear, small leathergoods and watches/jewelry; and The continued expansion of our Lauren product line in international markets. Investment in Operational Infrastructure Further systems enhancements and implementations to meet the expanding needs of our global organization. Disciplined Cost Management The ongoing evaluation of strategies to better align our cost structure with lower sales trends associated with reduced levels of consumer spending. Global Economic Developments The state of the global economy has continued to negatively impact the level of consumer spending for discretionary items over the course of the past year. This has affected our business as it is highly dependent on consumer demand for our products. Particularly, beginning in October 2008, our Retail segment began to experience sharp declines in comparable store sales, as did many of our traditional wholesale customers. These retail store declines continued until the second half of Fiscal 2010 when our Retail segment experienced positive comparable store sales growth due largely to the anniversarying of the lower benchmarks created in the prior year, as well as the realization of higher margins relating to improved inventory management and less promotional activity. While recent statistics indicate that the U.S. and certain other international economies are showing some signs of stabilization, there are still significant macroeconomic risks, including high rates of unemployment and growing economic uncertainty in Europe. As such, we believe the global macroeconomic environment and the related contraction in the level of worldwide consumer spending will likely continue to have a negative effect on our sales and operating margins across all segments through at least Fiscal 2011. We also anticipate that current inflationary pressures on raw material and fuel costs will likely negatively affect the cost of our products and related gross profit percentages in Fiscal 2011. We continue to monitor these risks and continually evaluate our operating strategies to adjust to any changes in economic conditions. For a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Fiscal 2010 10 K. 36 Table of Contents Summary of Financial Performance Operating Results In Fiscal 2010, we reported revenues of $4.979 billion, net income attributable to Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation (PRLC) of $479.5 million and net income per diluted share attributable to PRLC of $4.73. This compares to revenues of $5.019 billion, net income attributable to PRLC of $406.0 million and net income per diluted share attributable to PRLC of $4.01 in Fiscal 2009. Our operating performance for Fiscal 2010 was principally affected by a 0.8% decline in revenues, mainly due to lower revenues from our global Wholesale businesses as a result of the ongoing challenging global retail environment. This decrease was largely offset by a net increase in our global Retail sales and the inclusion of a 53rd week of sales in Fiscal 2010, as well as net favorable foreign currency effects. Despite the overall decline in revenues, we experienced an increase in gross profit percentage of 380 basis points to 58.2% primarily due to supply chain cost savings initiatives, improved inventory management and decreased promotional activity particularly across our global Retail businesses and our European Wholesale operations, as well as growth in our Japanese concessions based business driven by the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition (see Recent Developments for further discussion). SGA expenses increased during Fiscal 2010 primarily driven by higher incentive based compensation expenses and an increase in operating expenses attributable to our new business initiatives, which more than offset the benefits from various cost savings initiatives implemented in response to the current economic downturn. Net income and net income per diluted share attributable to PRLC increased in Fiscal 2010 as compared to Fiscal 2009. This was primarily due to a $111.4 million increase in operating income, offset in part by a $28.3 million increase in the provision for income taxes. The increase in the provision for income taxes was driven by the overall increase in pretax income, partially offset by a 50 basis point decline in our effective tax rate. These results were impacted by a $65.5 million reduction in pretax charges related to asset impairments and restructurings as well as increased pretax income of approximately $19 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2010, which combined had an aggregate effect of increasing our net income trends by approximately $54 million (approximately $0.53 per diluted share). Financial Condition and Liquidity Our financial position reflects the overall relative strength of our business results. We ended Fiscal 2010 in a net cash and investments position (total cash and cash equivalents, plus short term and non current investments less total debt) of $940.6 million, compared to $443.2 million as of the end of Fiscal 2009. The improvement in our financial position was primarily due to our operating cash flows, partially offset by our treasury stock repurchases, capital expenditures and the funding of our recent Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition (as defined and discussed under Recent Developments below). Our equity increased to $3.117 billion as of April 3, 2010, compared to $2.735 billion as of March 28, 2009, primarily due to our net income during Fiscal 2010, offset in part by our share repurchase activity. We generated $906.5 million of cash from operations during Fiscal 2010, compared to $774.2 million during Fiscal 2009. We used some of our cash availability to redeem approximately 90.8 million principal amount of debt for $121.0 million, to fund our Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition for $25.3 million (see Recent Developments), to support our common stock repurchase program and to reinvest in our business through capital spending. In particular, we used $231.0 million to repurchase 3.2 million shares of Class A common stock, including shares surrendered for tax withholdings. We also used $201.3 million for capital expenditures primarily associated with our global retail store expansion, construction and renovation of department store shop in shops and investments in our facilities and technological infrastructure. 37 Table of Contents Transactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition The comparability of the Companys operating results for the three fiscal years presented herein has been affected by certain transactions, including: Acquisitions that occurred in Fiscal 2010, Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2008. In particular, the Company completed the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition on December 31, 2009, the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition on August 1, 2008, the Japanese Business Acquisitions on May 29, 2007 and the Small Leathergoods Business Acquisition on April 13, 2007 (each as defined in Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements); and Certain pretax charges related to asset impairments and restructurings during the fiscal years presented. A summary of the effect of certain of these items on pretax income for each applicable fiscal year presented is noted below (references to Notes are to the notes to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements): Fiscal Years Ended April 3, March 28, March 29, 2010 2009 2008 (millions) Impairments of assets (see Note 11) $ (6.6 ) $ (55.4 ) $ (5.0 ) Restructuring charges (see Note 12) (6.9 ) (23.6 ) $ (13.5 ) $ (79.0 ) $ (5.0 ) The comparability of the Companys operating results has also been affected by the inclusion of a 53rd week in Fiscal 2010, which resulted in incremental revenues of approximately $70 million and increased net income of approximately $13 million. In addition, as a result of the reclassification of concessions based sales arrangements to our Retail segment from our Wholesale segment at the beginning of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010, segment information for Fiscal 2009 has been recast to conform to the current periods presentation. Segment information for Fiscal 2008 has not been recast to conform to the current periods presentation, as it is impracticable to do so. Accordingly, the related analysis of our results of operations for Fiscal 2009 compared to Fiscal 2008 as included in the following MDA has been prepared on a comparable basis using historical segment information. The following discussion of results of operations highlights, as necessary, the significant changes in operating results arising from these items and transactions. However, unusual items or transactions may occur in any period. Accordingly, investors and other financial statement users individually should consider the types of events and transactions that have affected operating trends. Recent Developments Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition On December 31, 2009, in connection with the transition of the Polo branded apparel business in Asia Pacific (excluding Japan) from a licensed to a wholly owned operation, the Company acquired certain net assets from Dickson Concepts International Limited and affiliates (Dickson) in exchange for an initial payment of approximately $20 million and other consideration of approximately $17 million (the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition). Dickson was the Companys licensee for Polo branded apparel in the Asia Pacific region (excluding Japan), which is comprised of China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. The Company funded the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition with available cash on hand. The results of operations for the Polo branded apparel business in Asia Pacific have been consolidated in the Companys results of operations commencing January 1, 2010. 38 Table of Contents Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition On August 1, 2008, in connection with the transition of the Polo branded childrenswear and golf apparel businesses in Japan from a licensed to a wholly owned operation, the Company acquired certain net assets (including inventory) from Naigai Co. Ltd. (Naigai) in exchange for a payment of approximately 2.8 billion (approximately $26 million as of the acquisition date) and certain other consideration (the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition). The Company funded the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition with available cash on hand. Naigai was the Companys licensee for childrenswear, golf apparel and hosiery under the Polo by Ralph Lauren and Ralph Lauren brands in Japan. In conjunction with the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition, the Company also entered into an additional 5 year licensing and design related agreement with Naigai for Polo and Chaps branded hosiery in Japan and a transition services agreement for the provision of a variety of operational, human resources and information systems related services over a period of up to eighteen months from the date of the closing of the transaction. The results of operations for the Polo branded childrenswear and golf apparel businesses in Japan have been consolidated in the Companys results of operations commencing August 2, 2008. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 The following table summarizes our results of operations and expresses the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain financial statement captions: Fiscal Years Ended April 3, March 28, 2010 2009 $ Change % Change (millions, except per share data) Net revenues $ 4,978.9 $ 5,018.9 $ (40.0 ) (0.8 )% Cost of goods sold(a) (2,079.8 ) (2,288.2 ) 208.4 (9.1 )% Gross profit 2,899.1 2,730.7 168.4 6.2 % Gross profit as % of net revenues 58.2 % 54.4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses(a) (2,157.0 ) (2,036.0 ) (121.0 ) 5.9 % SGA as % of net revenues 43.3 % 40.6 % Amortization of intangible assets (21.7 ) (20.2 ) (1.5 ) 7.4 % Impairments of assets (6.6 ) (55.4 ) 48.8 (88.1 )% Restructuring charges (6.9 ) (23.6 ) 16.7 (70.8 )% Operating income 706.9 595.5 111.4 18.7 % Operating income as % of net revenues 14.2 % 11.9 % Foreign currency gains (losses) (2.2 ) 1.6 (3.8 ) (237.5 )% Interest expense (22.2 ) (26.6 ) 4.4 (16.5 )% Interest and other income, net 12.4 22.0 (9.6 ) (43.6 )% Equity in income (loss) of equity method investees (5.6 ) (5.0 ) (0.6 ) 12.0 % Income before provision for income taxes 689.3 587.5 101.8 17.3 % Provision for income taxes (209.8 ) (181.5 ) (28.3 ) 15.6 % Effective tax rate(b) 30.4 % 30.9 % Net income attributable to PRLC $ 479.5 $ 406.0 $ 73.5 18.1 % Net income per common share attributable to PRLC: Basic $ 4.85 $ 4.09 $ 0.76 18.6 % Diluted $ 4.73 $ 4.01 $ 0.72 18.0 % 39 Table of Contents (a) Includes total depreciation expense of $159.5 million and $164.2 million for Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009, respectively. (b) Effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before provision for income taxes. Net Revenues. Net revenues decreased by $40.0 million, or 0.8%, to $4.979 billion in Fiscal 2010 from $5.019 billion in Fiscal 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenues from our global Wholesale businesses, partially offset by a net increase in our global Retail sales and net favorable foreign currency effects. Also offsetting the decrease in revenues was the inclusion of a 53rd week in Fiscal 2010 compared to 52 weeks in Fiscal 2009, which resulted in incremental revenues of approximately $70 million. Excluding the effect of foreign currency, net revenues decreased by 1.1%. On a reported basis, Wholesale revenues decreased by $217.1 million, primarily as a result of global net sales declines in most of our product lines largely due to the ongoing challenging global retail environment. Retail revenues increased by $188.9 million, primarily as a result of growth in RalphLauren.com sales, increased revenues from our Japanese businesses largely as a result of the childrenswear and golf acquisition and continued global store expansion. The increase in Retail revenues also reflected incremental sales from our newly acquired Polo branded apparel business in Asia Pacific. Licensing revenue decreased by $11.8 million, primarily due to declines in product and home licensing royalties driven by lower fragrance and paint related royalties, respectively, as well as a decrease in international licensing royalties due to the loss of licensing revenues from the newly acquired Polo branded apparel business in Asia Pacific and childrenswear and golf businesses in Japan (all now consolidated as part of the Retail segment). Net revenues for our three business segments under the Companys new (recasted) basis of reporting are provided below: Fiscal Years Ended April 3, March 28, 2010 2009 $ Change % Change (millions) Net Revenues: Wholesale $ 2,532.4 $ 2,749.5 $ (217.1 ) (7.9 )% Retail 2,263.1 2,074.2 188.9 9.1 % Licensing 183.4 195.2 (11.8 ) (6.0 )% Total net revenues $ 4,978.9 $ 5,018.9 $ (40.0 ) (0.8 )% Wholesale net revenues The net decrease primarily reflects: a $154 million aggregate net decrease in our domestic businesses primarily due to a decrease in womenswear, menswear and childrenswear sales (including a decline in revenues from related American Living product categories) as a result of the ongoing challenging U.S. retail environment (as discussed further in the Overview section), offset in part by higher footwear sales driven by increased door penetration; a $36 million net decrease in our Japanese businesses on a constant currency basis primarily due to a decrease in womenswear sales largely as a result of the ongoing challenging global retail environment; a $25 million net decrease in our European businesses on a constant currency basis primarily driven by decreased sales in our menswear and childrenswear product lines, partially offset by an increase in womenswear sales largely due to the inclusion of revenues from the newly launched Lauren product line; and a $2 million net decrease in revenues due to an unfavorable foreign currency effect related to the overall weakening of the Euro, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency effect related to the strengthening of the Yen, both in comparison to the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2010. The total net decrease in Wholesale revenues discussed above included an approximate $30 million increase due to the inclusion of an extra week of sales in Fiscal 2010 as compared to Fiscal 2009. Retail net revenues For purposes of the discussion of Retail operating performance below, we refer to the measure comparable store sales. Comparable store sales refer to the growth of sales in stores that are open for at least one full fiscal year. Sales for stores that are closing during a fiscal year are excluded from the calculation of 40 Table of Contents comparable store sales. Sales for stores that are either relocated, enlarged (as defined by gross square footage expansion of 25% or greater) or generally closed for 30 or more consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales until such stores have been in their new location or in a newly renovated state for at least one full fiscal year. Comparable store sales information includes both Ralph Lauren (including Rugby) and Club Monaco stores, as well as concessions based shop within shops and RalphLauren.com. The net increase in Retail net revenues primarily reflects: a $163 million aggregate net increase in non comparable store sales primarily driven by: a $40 million increase in revenues due to the inclusion of an extra week of sales in Fiscal 2010 as compared to Fiscal 2009; an increase of approximately $32 million on a constant currency basis related to the inclusion of a full year of revenues from our concessions based shop within shops assumed in connection with the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition in comparison to seven months in the prior fiscal year (see Recent Developments for further discussion); the inclusion of $29 million of sales from stores and concessions based shop within shops assumed in connection with the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition (see Recent Developments for further discussion); an increase related to new store openings within the past twelve months. There was a net increase in average global store count of 9 stores, to a total of 350 stores, as compared to Fiscal 2009. The net increase in store count was primarily due to a number of new domestic and international full price and factory store openings as well as the inclusion of stores acquired in Asia Pacific region, offset in part by the closure of certain Club Monaco stores; and a net aggregate favorable foreign currency effect of $16 million primarily related to the strengthening of the Yen, partially offset by the overall weakening of the Euro, both in comparison to the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2010. a $6 million aggregate net decrease in comparable physical store sales driven by our global full price stores, including a net aggregate unfavorable foreign currency effect of $2 million primarily related to the overall weakening of the Euro, partially offset by the strengthening of the Yen, both in comparison to the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2010. This decrease was more than offset by a $32 million increase in RalphLauren.com sales. Comparable store sales under the Companys new (recasted) basis of reporting are presented below on a 52 week basis: Fiscal Year Ended April 3, 2010 Increases/(decreases) in comparable store sales as reported: Full price Ralph Lauren store sales(a) (4 )% Full price Club Monaco store sales 2 % Factory store sales 1 % RalphLauren.com sales 18 % Total increase in comparable store sales as reported 1 % Increases/(decreases) in comparable store sales excluding the effect of foreign currency: Full price Ralph Lauren store sales(b) (4 )% Full price Club Monaco store sales 2 % Factory store sales 1 % RalphLauren.com sales 18 % Total increase in comparable store sales excluding the effect of foreign currency 2 % 41.1 Table of Contents (a) Includes an increase of 24% in comparable sales for concessions based shop within shops. (b) Includes an increase of 15% in comparable sales for concessions based shop within shops. Licensing revenue The net decrease primarily reflects: a $8 million decrease in international licensing royalties, primarily due to the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition as well as the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition (see Recent Developments for further discussion); and a $5 million decrease in home licensing royalties primarily driven by lower paint and bedding and bath related royalties. The above net decrease was partially offset by: a $1 million net increase in product licensing royalties primarily driven by higher footwear royalties, partially offset by lower fragrance related royalties. Gross Profit. Cost of goods sold includes the expenses incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale, including product costs, freight in and import costs, as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory realizability. The costs of selling merchandise, including those associated with preparing the merchandise for sale, such as picking, packing, warehousing and order charges, are included in SGA expenses. Gross profit increased by $168.4 million, or 6.2%, to $2.899 billion in Fiscal 2010 from $2.731 billion in Fiscal 2009. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased by 380 basis points to 58.2% in Fiscal 2010 from 54.4% in Fiscal 2009. This increase was primarily due to supply chain cost savings initiatives, improved inventory management and decreased promotional activity particularly across our global Retail businesses and our European Wholesale operations, as well as growth in our Japanese concessions based business driven by the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition (see Recent Developments for further discussion). Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in material costs. These factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year. We anticipate that current macroeconomic challenges, including inflationary pressures on raw material and fuel costs, could negatively affect the cost of our products and related gross profit percentages in Fiscal 2011. See Item 1A Risk Factors for further discussion. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SGA expenses primarily include compensation and benefits, marketing, distribution, bad debts, information technology, facilities, legal and other costs associated with finance and administration. SGA expenses increased by $121.0 million, or 5.9%, to $2.157 billion in Fiscal 2010 from $2.036 billion in Fiscal 2009. The increase included an unfavorable foreign currency effect of approximately $15 million, primarily related to the strengthening of the Yen in comparison to the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2010. SGA expenses as a percent of net revenues increased to 43.3% in Fiscal 2010 from 40.6% in Fiscal 2009. The 270 basis point increase was primarily driven by the decrease in net revenues as well as higher compensation related expenses and an increase in operating expenses attributable to our new business initiatives. Including the $15 million unfavorable foreign currency effect, the $121.0 million increase in SGA expenses was primarily driven by: higher compensation related expenses of approximately $78 million primarily relating to an increase in incentive based compensation; the inclusion of SGA costs of approximately $35 million related to our newly acquired Polo branded apparel business in Asia Pacific (see Recent Developments for further discussion); an approximate $22 million increase related to the inclusion of a full year of SGA costs for our recently acquired Japanese childrenswear and golf businesses in comparison to seven months in the prior fiscal year, including costs incurred pursuant to transition service arrangements (see Recent Developments for further discussion); and 42 Table of Contents an approximate $17 million increase in rent and utility costs primarily to support the ongoing global growth of our businesses. The above increases were partially offset by lower SGA expenses associated with the Companys cost savings initiatives implemented in late Fiscal 2009, as well as: lower selling expenses of approximately $28 million principally relating to lower wholesale sales; and an approximate $14 million decrease in brand related marketing and advertising costs. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets increased by $1.5 million, or 7.4%, to $21.7 million in Fiscal 2010 from $20.2 million in Fiscal 2009. This increase was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in connection with the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition in comparison to seven months in the prior fiscal year, as well as amortization of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition (see Recent Developments for further discussion). Impairments of Assets. A non cash impairment charge of $6.6 million was recognized in Fiscal 2010, compared to $55.4 million in Fiscal 2009. These charges reduced the net carrying values of certain long lived assets, primarily in the Companys Retail segment, to their estimated fair values. These impairment charges were primarily attributable to the lower than expected operating performances of certain retail stores, which in Fiscal 2009 arose in large part due to the significant contraction in consumer spending experienced during the latter half of that fiscal year. See Note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Restructuring Charges. Restructuring charges of $6.9 million recognized in Fiscal 2010 primarily related to employee termination costs, as well as the write down of an asset associated with exiting a retail store in Japan. Restructuring charges of $23.6 million recognized in Fiscal 2009 were primarily associated with a restructuring plan initiated during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 to better align the Companys cost base with lower sales and operating margin trends associated with the slowdown in consumer spending, and to improve overall operating effectiveness (the Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan). This Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan included a reduction in workforce and the closure of certain underperforming retail stores. See Note 12 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Operating Income. Operating income increased by $111.4 million, or 18.7%, to $706.9 million in Fiscal 2010 from $595.5 million in Fiscal 2009. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues increased 230 basis points, to 14.2% in Fiscal 2010 from 11.9% in Fiscal 2009. The increase in operating income as a percentage of net revenues primarily reflected the increase in gross profit margin and lower pretax charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, partially offset by the increase in SGA expenses as a percent of net revenues, as previously discussed. Operating income for our three business segments under the Companys new (recasted) basis of reporting is provided below: Fiscal Years Ended April 3, March 28, 2010 2009 $ Change % Change (millions) Operating Income: Wholesale $ 585.3 $ 619.9 $ (34.6 ) (5.6 )% Retail 254.1 101.6 152.5 150.1 % Licensing 107.4 103.6 3.8 3.7 % 946.8 825.1 121.7 14.7 % Less: Unallocated corporate expenses (229.9 ) (206.5 ) (23.4 ) 11.3 % Unallocated legal and restructuring charges (10.0 ) (23.1 ) 13.1 (56.7 )% Total operating income $ 706.9 $ 595.5 $ 111.4 18.7 % Wholesale operating income decreased by $34.6 million primarily as a result of lower revenues, partially offset by higher gross margins driven by improved inventory management principally in our European businesses. 43 Table of Contents Retail operating income increased by $152.5 million primarily as a result of increased revenues and higher gross margins across our global Retail businesses driven by decreased promotional activity and lower reductions in the carrying cost of our retail inventory. The increase also was due to lower impairment related charges. These increases were partially offset by increased SGA expenses primarily driven by higher rent and incentive based compensation expenses. Licensing operating income increased by $3.8 million primarily as a result of lower net costs associated with the transition of our licensed businesses to wholly owned operations, offset in part by lower revenues largely driven by a decline in international royalties and home licensing royalties. Unallocated corporate expenses increased by $23.4 million, primarily as a result of higher incentive based compensation expenses, partially offset by lower brand related marketing and advertising costs. Unallocated legal and restructuring charges of $10.0 million in Fiscal 2010 were comprised of restructuring charges of $6.9 million primarily related to employee termination costs and the write down of an asset associated with exiting a retail store in Japan, as well as legal charges of $4.8 million primarily related to the Companys California Labor Litigation matter offset in part by the reversal of an excess legal reserve of $1.7 million (see Note 17 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion). In Fiscal 2009, unallocated legal and restructuring charges of $23.1 million were comprised of restructuring charges of $23.6 million primarily associated with the Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan, as previously discussed, offset by a reversal of an excess legal reserve in the amount of $0.5 million. Foreign Currency Gains (Losses). The effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss of $2.2 million in Fiscal 2010, compared to a gain of $1.6 million in Fiscal 2009. Excluding a net increase in foreign currency gains of $1.0 million relating to undesignated foreign currency hedge contracts, the increase in foreign currency losses in Fiscal 2010 as compared to Fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the timing of the settlement of intercompany receivables and payables (that were not of a long term investment nature) between certain of our international and domestic subsidiaries. Foreign currency gains and losses are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. Interest Expense. Interest expense includes the borrowing costs of our outstanding debt, including amortization of debt issuance costs, and interest related to our capital lease obligations. Interest expense decreased by $4.4 million, or 16.5%, to $22.2 million in Fiscal 2010 from $26.6 million in Fiscal 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a lower principal amount of our outstanding Euro denominated 4.5% notes as a result of a partial debt extinguishment in July 2009. Interest and Other Income, net. Interest and other income, net, decreased by $9.6 million, or 43.6%, to $12.4 million in Fiscal 2010 from $22.0 million in Fiscal 2009, primarily due to lower yields relating to lower market rates of interest. This decrease was offset in part by an increase in our average balance of cash and cash equivalents and investments during Fiscal 2010, as well as a net gain of $4.1 million related to a partial extinguishment of the Companys Euro denominated 4.5% notes in July 2009. Equity in Income (Loss) of Equity Method Investees. The equity in loss of equity method investees of $5.6 million in Fiscal 2010 related to the Companys share of loss from its joint venture, the Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Company, S.A.R.L. (the RL Watch Company), which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The equity in loss of equity method investees of $5.0 million in Fiscal 2009 related to the Companys share of loss driven by certain start up costs associated with the RL Watch Company. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by $28.3 million, or 15.6%, to $209.8 million in Fiscal 2010 from $181.5 million in Fiscal 2009. The increase in provision for income taxes was primarily a result of higher pretax income in Fiscal 2010 compared to Fiscal 2009. This increase was partially offset by a net decline in our reported effective tax rate of 50 basis points, to 30.4% in Fiscal 2010 from 30.9% in Fiscal 2009. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to a greater proportion of earnings generated in lower taxed jurisdictions as well as tax reserve reductions principally associated with audit settlements, offset in part by certain higher non deductible expenses. The effective tax rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses. Our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on non recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and amount of 44 Table of Contents foreign dividends, enacted tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax audit findings and settlements, and the interaction of various global tax strategies. Net Income Attributable to PRLC. Net income increased by $73.5 million, or 18.1%, to $479.5 million in Fiscal 2010 from $406.0 million in Fiscal 2009. The increase in net income was primarily due to a $111.4 million increase in operating income, offset in part by a $28.3 million increase in the provision for income taxes, as previously discussed. These results were impacted by a $65.5 million reduction in pretax charges related to asset impairments and restructurings as well as increased pretax income of approximately $19 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2010, which combined had an aggregate effect of increasing our net income trends by approximately $54 million. Net Income Per Diluted Share Attributable to PRLC. Net income per diluted share increased by $0.72, or 18.0%, to $4.73 per share in Fiscal 2010 from $4.01 per share in Fiscal 2009. The increase in diluted per share results was due to the higher level of net income, as previously discussed. These results were impacted by a $65.5 million reduction in pretax charges related to asset impairments and restructurings as well as increased pretax income of approximately $19 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2010, which combined had an aggregate effect of increasing our net income per diluted share trends by approximately $0.53.

As discussed in the Overview section, segment information for Fiscal 2008 has not been recast to reflect the reclassification of concessions based sales arrangements to our Retail segment from our Wholesale segment at the beginning of the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2010. In order to present operating results on a comparable basis, the following analysis of our results of operations for Fiscal 2009 compared to Fiscal 2008 has been prepared using historical segment information. Net Revenues. Net revenues increased by $138.8 million, or 2.8%, to $5.019 billion in Fiscal 2009 from $4.880 billion in Fiscal 2008. The increase was principally due to growth in our global Wholesale business, increased global Retail sales, and net favorable foreign currency effects. Excluding the effect of foreign currency, net revenues increased by 2.2%. On a reported basis, Wholesale revenues increased by $129.1 million, primarily as a result of the inclusion of a full year of revenues from the newly launched American Living product line and increased revenues from our European and Japanese businesses, offset in part by decreased sales in our core domestic product lines. Retail revenues increased by $23.9 million primarily as a result of continued global store expansion and growth in RalphLauren.com sales, partially offset by a net decline in comparable store sales. Licensing revenue decreased by $14.2 million, primarily due to a decrease in international licensing royalties as a result of the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition (see Recent Developments for further discussion). Net revenues for our three business segments under the Companys historical basis of reporting are provided below: Fiscal Years Ended March 28, March 29, 2009 2008 $ Change % Change (millions) Net Revenues: Wholesale $ 2,887.2 $ 2,758.1 $ 129.1 4.7 % Retail 1,936.5 1,912.6 23.9 1.2 % Licensing 195.2 209.4 (14.2 ) (6.8 )% Total net revenues $ 5,018.9 $ 4,880.1 $ 138.8 2.8 % Wholesale net revenues The net increase primarily reflects: a $74 million net increase in our European businesses on a constant currency basis driven by increased sales in our menswear, womenswear and childrenswear product lines, partially offset by an increase in promotional activity; a $47 million net increase in our Japanese operations on a constant currency basis primarily as a result of the inclusion of revenues from the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition (see Recent Developments for further discussion), offset in part by sales declines in our core businesses; and a $37 million net increase in revenues due to a favorable foreign currency effect related to the strengthening of the Yen, partially offset by an unfavorable foreign currency effect related to the weakening of the Euro, both in comparison to the U.S. dollar in Fiscal 2009. The above increases were partially offset by: a $29 million aggregate net decrease in our domestic businesses primarily due to reduced shipments across our core menswear, womenswear and childrenswear product lines as a result of the ongoing challenging U.S. retail environment (as discussed further in the Overview section). Offsetting this decrease was the inclusion of a full year of revenues from the newly launched American Living product line and an increase in footwear sales largely attributable to increased door penetration. 46 Table of Contents Retail net revenues The net increase primarily reflects: an $81 million aggregate net increase in non comparable store sales, primarily relating to new store openings within the past twelve months. There was a net increase in average global store count of 21 stores, to a total of 326 stores, as compared to the prior fiscal year. The net increase in store count was primarily due to a number of new domestic and international full price and factory store openings. The above increase was partially offset by: an $84 million aggregate net decrease in comparable physical store sales driven by our global full price stores, including an aggregate net unfavorable foreign currency effect of $13 million primarily related to the weakening of the Euro in comparison to the U.S. dollar in Fiscal 2009. This decrease was partially offset by a $27 million increase in RalphLauren.com sales. Comparable store sales under the Companys historical basis of reporting are provided below: Fiscal Year Ended March 28, 2009 Increases/(decreases) in comparable store sales as reported: Full price Ralph Lauren store sales (12 )% Full price Club Monaco store sales (10 )% Factory store sales (2 )% RalphLauren.com sales 19 % Total decrease in comparable store sales as reported (4 )% Increases/(decreases) in comparable store sales excluding the effect of foreign currency: Full price Ralph Lauren store sales (12 )% Full price Club Monaco store sales (10 )% Factory store sales (1 )% RalphLauren.com sales 19 % Total decrease in comparable store sales excluding the effect of foreign currency (3 )% Licensing revenue The net decrease primarily reflects: a $17 million decrease in international licensing royalties, primarily due to the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition (see Recent Developments for further discussion). The above decrease was partially offset by: a $3 million increase in domestic licensing royalties, primarily driven by increases in mens personal apparel and the inclusion of a full year of royalties for American Living. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in fragrance related royalties. Gross Profit. Cost of goods sold includes the expenses incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale, including product costs, freight in and import costs, as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory realizability. The costs of selling merchandise, including those associated with preparing the merchandise for sale, such as picking, packing, warehousing and order charges, are included in SGA expenses. Gross profit increased by $92.6 million, or 3.5%, to $2.731 billion in Fiscal 2009 from $2.638 billion in Fiscal 2008. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased by 30 basis points to 54.4% in Fiscal 2009 from 54.1% in Fiscal 2008, primarily driven by the growth of our European and Japanese wholesale operations, as well as the net decrease of unfavorable purchase accounting effects associated with prior business acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by increased markdown activity and higher reductions in the carrying cost of our retail inventory, largely as a result of the economic downturn. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SGA expenses primarily include compensation and benefits, marketing, distribution, bad debts, information technology, facilities, legal and other costs associated with finance and 47 Table of Contents administration. SGA expenses increased by $103.5 million, or 5.4%, to $2.036 billion in Fiscal 2009 from $1.932 billion in Fiscal 2008. The increase included a net unfavorable foreign currency effect of approximately $14 million, primarily related to the strengthening of the Yen, partially offset by the weakening of the Euro, both in comparison to the U.S. dollar in Fiscal 2009. SGA expenses as a percent of net revenues increased to 40.6% in Fiscal 2009 from 39.6% in Fiscal 2008. The 100 basis point increase was primarily driven by increased operating expenses attributable to our new business initiatives. The $103.5 million increase in SGA expenses was primarily driven by: the inclusion of SGA costs of approximately $38 million related to our recently acquired Japanese childrenswear and golf businesses, including costs incurred pursuant to transition service arrangements (see Recent Developments for further discussion); higher compensation related expenses of approximately $35 million principally relating to increased selling costs associated with higher retail sales and our ongoing product line expansion, including American Living and a dedicated dress business across multiple brands. These increases were partially offset by lower stock based compensation expense largely driven by a decrease in the Companys share price as of the date of its annual equity award grant in the second quarter of Fiscal 2009 compared to the share price as of the comparable grant date in Fiscal 2008; an approximate $29 million increase in rent and utility costs to support the ongoing global growth of our businesses, including rent expense related to certain retail stores scheduled to open in Fiscal 2010; an approximate $12 million net increase in litigation related charges, including approximately $4 million related to the reversal of an excess legal reserve in Fiscal 2008; and an approximate $11 million increase in bad debt expenses due largely to the negative effects of the slowdown in the global economy on the financial condition and liquidity of our customer base. The above increases were partially offset by: an approximate $20 million decrease in brand related marketing and advertising costs primarily as a result of the implementation of related cost savings initiatives in response to the economic downturn, as well as the absence of costs associated with the Companys 40th Anniversary celebration in Fiscal 2008. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets decreased by $27.0 million, or 57.2%, to $20.2 million in Fiscal 2009 from $47.2 million in Fiscal 2008. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of the amortization of the licenses acquired in the Japanese Business Acquisitions, which were fully amortized by the end of Fiscal 2008. Impairments of Assets. An aggregate non cash impairment charge of $55.4 million was recognized in Fiscal 2009, compared to $5.0 million in Fiscal 2008. These charges reduced the net carrying values of certain long lived assets, primarily in the Companys Retail segment, to their estimated fair values. These impairment charges were primarily attributable to lower than expected operating performances in certain stores, which in Fiscal 2009, arose in large part due to the significant contraction in consumer spending experienced during the latter half of that fiscal year. See Note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Restructuring Charges. Restructuring charges of $23.6 million were recognized in Fiscal 2009 primarily associated with a restructuring plan initiated during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 to better align the Companys cost base with lower sales and operating margin trends associated with the slowdown in consumer spending, and to improve overall operating effectiveness. This Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan included a reduction in workforce and the closure of certain underperforming retail stores. No restructuring charges were recorded in Fiscal 2008. See Note 12 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Operating Income. Operating income decreased by $57.9 million, or 8.9%, to $595.5 million in Fiscal 2009 from $653.4 million in Fiscal 2008. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues decreased 150 basis points to 11.9% in Fiscal 2009 from 13.4% in Fiscal 2008. The decrease in operating income as a percentage of net revenues primarily reflected increases in SGA expenses, and $79.0 million of pretax charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, partially offset by a decrease in amortization of intangible assets, as previously discussed. 48 Table of Contents Operating income for our three business segments under the Companys historical basis of reporting is provided below: Fiscal Years Ended March 28, March 29, 2009 2008 $ Change % Change (millions) Operating Income: Wholesale $ 613.3 $ 565.4 $ 47.9 8.5 % Retail 108.2 204.2 (96.0 ) (47.0 )% Licensing 103.6 96.7 6.9 7.1 % 825.1 866.3 (41.2 ) (4.8 )% Less: Unallocated corporate expenses (206.5 ) (217.0 ) 10.5 (4.8 )% Unallocated legal and restructuring charges (23.1 ) 4.1 (27.2 ) (663.4 )% Total operating income $ 595.5 $ 653.4 $ (57.9 ) (8.9 )% Wholesale operating income increased by $47.9 million primarily as a result of higher revenues, as well as improved gross margin largely driven by our European and Japanese wholesale operations. The increase also was due to the net decrease of unfavorable purchase accounting effects primarily associated with prior business acquisitions. These increases were partially offset by higher SGA expenses attributable largely to our new business initiatives. Retail operating income decreased by $96.0 million primarily as a result of $47.0 million of higher impairment related charges, higher reductions in the carrying cost of our retail inventory, and higher rent and occupancy costs. The decrease was partially offset by higher revenues and the absence of certain unfavorable purchase accounting effects associated with the acquisition of the remaining 50% equity interest of Ralph Lauren Media included in the prior fiscal year. Licensing operating income increased by $6.9 million primarily as a result of a decrease in amortization of intangible assets due to the absence of the amortization of the license acquired in the Japanese Business Acquisitions, which was fully amortized by the end of Fiscal 2008. Also contributing to the increased operating income was an increase in domestic licensing royalties, primarily driven by the inclusion of royalties for American Living. These increases were offset in part by a net decrease in international royalties primarily due to the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition (see Recent Developments for further discussion). Unallocated corporate expenses decreased by $10.5 million primarily as a result of a decrease in brand related marketing and advertising costs, as well as lower stock based compensation expense, as previously discussed. Unallocated legal and restructuring charges of $23.1 million in Fiscal 2009 were comprised of restructuring charges of $23.6 million primarily associated with the Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan, as previously discussed, offset by a reversal of an excess legal reserve in the amount of $0.5 million. In Fiscal 2008, unallocated legal and restructuring charges were comprised of a reversal of an excess legal reserve in the amount of $4.1 million. Foreign Currency Gains (Losses). The effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a gain of $1.6 million in Fiscal 2009, compared to a loss of $6.4 million in Fiscal 2008. The prior fiscal year loss included a $1.6 million write off of foreign currency option contracts, entered into to manage certain foreign currency exposure associated with the Japanese Business Acquisitions, which expired unexercised. Excluding the aforementioned transaction, foreign currency gains increased in Fiscal 2009 as compared to Fiscal 2008, primarily due to the timing of the settlement of intercompany receivables and payables (that were not of a long term investment nature) between certain of our international and domestic subsidiaries. Foreign currency gains and losses are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. Interest Expense. Interest expense includes the borrowing costs of our outstanding debt, including amortization of debt issuance costs, and interest related to our capital lease obligations. Interest expense increased by 49 Table of Contents $0.9 million, to $26.6 million in Fiscal 2009 from $25.7 million in Fiscal 2008. This increase is primarily due to an increase in interest expense related to capital lease obligations, offset in part by a decrease in interest expense related to borrowings under a one year term loan agreement repaid by the Company in May 2008. Interest and Other Income, net. Interest and other income, net, decreased by $2.7 million, to $22.0 million in Fiscal 2009 from $24.7 million in Fiscal 2008. This decrease was primarily driven by lower yields relating to lower market rates of interest in Fiscal 2009, offset in part by an increase in our average balance of cash and short term investments during Fiscal 2009. Equity in Income (Loss) of Equity Method Investees. The equity in loss of equity method investees of $5.0 million in Fiscal 2009 and $1.8 million in Fiscal 2008 primarily related to the Companys share of loss driven by certain start up costs associated with the RL Watch Company, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The provision for income taxes decreased by $40.8 million, or 18.4%, to $181.5 million in Fiscal 2009 from $222.3 million in Fiscal 2008. The decrease in provision for income taxes was principally due to an overall decrease in pretax income in Fiscal 2009 compared to Fiscal 2008. This decrease also was due to a reduction in our reported effective tax rate of 360 basis points, to 30.9% in Fiscal 2009 from 34.5% in Fiscal 2008. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to a shift in the geographic mix of earnings. In particular, there was a greater proportion of earnings generated in lower taxed jurisdictions and the tax benefits associated with the asset impairment and restructuring charges were recognized in higher taxed jurisdictions. Net Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interest. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interest of $2.1 million in Fiscal 2008 related to the Companys remaining 50% interest in Polo Ralph Lauren Japan Corporation, which was acquired in May 2007, and the allocation of net income of Impact 21 Co., Ltd. to the holders of the 80% interest not owned by the Company prior to the closing date of the related acquisition. No net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was recorded in Fiscal 2009 as both of these companies have been wholly owned. Net Income Attributable to PRLC. Net income attributable to PRLC decreased by $13.8 million, or 3.3%, to $406.0 million in Fiscal 2009 from $419.8 million in Fiscal 2008. This decrease principally related to a $57.9 million decrease in operating income, offset in part by a $40.8 million decrease in the provision for income taxes, as previously discussed. These results were negatively impacted by $79.0 million of pretax charges recognized in Fiscal 2009 related to asset impairments and restructurings, which had an aggregate effect of reducing net income attributable to PRLC in Fiscal 2009 by $49.7 million. Net Income Per Diluted Share Attributable to PRLC. Net income per diluted share attributable to PRLC increased by $0.02, or 0.5%, to $4.01 per share in Fiscal 2009 from $3.99 per share in Fiscal 2008, as the effect of lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding was mostly offset by the decrease in net income attributable to PRLC in Fiscal 2009. These results were negatively impacted by $79.0 million of pretax charges recognized in Fiscal 2009 related to asset impairments and restructurings, which had an aggregate effect of reducing net income per diluted share attributable to PRLC in Fiscal 2009 by $0.49. 50 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Financial Condition April 3, March 28, 2010 2009 $ Change (millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 563.1 $ 481.2 $ 81.9 Short term investments 584.1 338.7 245.4 Non current investments 75.5 29.7 45.8 Long term debt (282.1 ) (406.4 ) 124.3 Net cash and investments(a) $ 940.6 $ 443.2 $ 497.4 Equity $ 3,116.6 $ 2,735.1 $ 381.5 (a) Net cash and investments is defined as total cash and cash equivalents, plus short term and non current investments, less total debt. The increase in the Companys net cash and investments position as of April 3, 2010 as compared to March 28, 2009 was primarily due to our operating cash flows, partially offset by the Companys use of cash to support its treasury stock repurchases, capital expenditures and acquisition spending. In Fiscal 2010, the Company used $231.0 million to repurchase 3.2 million shares of Class A common stock, including shares surrendered for tax withholdings, and spent $201.3 million for capital expenditures. In addition, the Company used $25.3 million to fund its recent Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition (see Recent Developments). The Companys net cash and investments position as of April 3, 2010 also reflected the repurchase of 90.8 million principal amount of Euro denominated 4.5% notes in July 2009 for $121.0 million (see Debt and Covenant Compliance below for further discussion). The increase in equity was primarily due to the Companys net income in Fiscal 2010, offset in part by an increase in treasury stock as a result of the Companys common stock repurchase program. Cash Flows Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Fiscal Years Ended April 3, March 28, 2010 2009 $ Change (millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 906.5 $ 774.2 $ 132.3 Net cash used in investing activities (504.4 ) (458.0 ) (46.4 ) Net cash used in financing activities (306.4 ) (352.1 ) 45.7 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (13.8 ) (34.4 ) 20.6 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 81.9 $ (70.3 ) $ 152.2 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $906.5 million in Fiscal 2010, compared to $774.2 million in Fiscal 2009. This net increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by: lower accounts receivable levels due to improved cash collections and lower sales in the Companys Wholesale segment; an increase related to inventory primarily due to the effects of ongoing inventory management across most businesses; and an increase in net income before depreciation, amortization, stock based compensation and other non cash expenses, including impairments of assets. 51 Table of Contents The above increases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by: a decrease related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities primarily due to the timing of payments. Other than the items described above, the changes in operating assets and liabilities were attributable to normal operating fluctuations. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $504.4 million in Fiscal 2010, as compared to $458.0 million in Fiscal 2009. The net increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by: an increase in cash used to purchase investments, less proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. In Fiscal 2010, the Company used $1.351 billion to purchase investments, less $1.072 billion of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2009, the Company used $623.1 million to purchase investments, less $369.5 million of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments; an increase in cash used in connection with capital expenditures. In Fiscal 2010, the Company spent $201.3 million for capital expenditures, as compared to $185.0 million in Fiscal 2009. The Companys capital expenditures were primarily associated with global retail store expansion, construction and renovation of department store shop within shops and investments in its facilities and technological infrastructure; and a change in cash deposits restricted in connection with taxes. In Fiscal 2010, net restricted cash of $6.2 million was released, as compared to $26.9 million of restricted cash released in Fiscal 2009 primarily in connection with the partial settlement of certain international tax matters. The above increases in cash used in investing activities were partially offset by: a decrease in net cash used to fund the Companys acquisitions and ventures. In Fiscal 2010, the Company used $30.8 million primarily to fund the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition. On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2009, the Company used $46.3 million primarily to fund the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition and to complete the minority interest buyout related to the acquisition of certain of the Companys formerly licensed Japanese businesses. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $306.4 million in Fiscal 2010, as compared to $352.1 million in Fiscal 2009. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by: a decrease in cash used in connection with the Companys repayment of debt. In Fiscal 2010, the Company completed a cash tender offer and used $121.0 million to repurchase 90.8 million of principal amount of its 4.5% notes due October 4, 2013. On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2009, the Company repaid 20.5 billion ($196.8 million as of the repayment date) of borrowings under a one year term loan agreement pursuant to an amendment and restatement to the Companys existing credit facility (the Term Loan); and an increase in cash received from the exercise of employee stock options. In Fiscal 2010, the Company received $50.5 million from the exercise of employee stock options, as compared to $29.0 million in Fiscal 2009. The above decrease in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by: an increase in cash used in connection with repurchases of the Companys Class A common stock. In Fiscal 2010, 2.9 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $215.9 million were repurchased pursuant to the Companys common stock repurchase program and 0.3 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $15.1 million were surrendered to, or withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under the Companys 1997 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the 1997 Plan). On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2009, $169.8 million of cash was used in connection with common stock repurchases and shares surrendered for tax withholdings. 52 Table of Contents Fiscal 2009 Compared to Fiscal 2008 Fiscal Years Ended March 28, March 29, 2009 2008 $ Change (millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 774.2 $ 695.4 $ 78.8 Net cash used in investing activities (458.0 ) (505.0 ) 47.0 Net cash used in financing activities (352.1 ) (260.5 ) (91.6 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (34.4 ) 57.7 (92.1 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (70.3 ) $ (12.4 ) $ (57.9 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $774.2 million in Fiscal 2009, compared to $695.4 million in Fiscal 2008. This net increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by: an increase in net income before depreciation, amortization, non cash asset impairment charges, stock based compensation and other non cash expenses; and an approximate $84 million decrease in cash tax payments. The above increases were partially offset by: an increase in inventory primarily due to the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition, offset in part by the effects of ongoing inventory management across most businesses. Other than the items described above, the changes in operating assets and liabilities were attributable to normal operating fluctuations. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $458.0 million in Fiscal 2009, as compared to $505.0 million in Fiscal 2008. The net decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by: a decrease in net cash used to fund the Companys acquisitions and ventures. In Fiscal 2009, the Company used $46.3 million primarily to fund the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition and to complete the minority squeeze out related to the Japanese Business Acquisitions. On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2008, the Company used $188.7 million principally to fund the Japanese Business Acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and the Small Leathergoods Business Acquisition; a decrease in cash used in connection with capital expenditures. In Fiscal 2009, the Company spent $185.0 million for capital expenditures, as compared to $217.1 million in Fiscal 2008. The Companys capital expenditures were primarily associated with global retail store expansion, construction and renovation of department store shop within shops and investments in its facilities and technological infrastructure; and a change in restricted cash deposits. In Fiscal 2009, net restricted cash of $26.9 million was released primarily in connection with the partial settlement of certain international tax matters. On a comparative basis, Fiscal 2008 included net restricted cash deposits of $15.1 million. The above decreases were partially offset by: an increase in cash used to purchase investments, less proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. In Fiscal 2009, the Company used $623.1 million to purchase investments, less $369.5 million of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2008, $96.8 million was used to purchase investments, less $12.7 million of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. 53 Table of Contents Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $352.1 million in Fiscal 2009, as compared to $260.5 million in Fiscal 2008. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by: the repayment of 20.5 billion ($196.8 million as of the repayment date) of the Term Loan in Fiscal 2009 related to the Japanese Business Acquisitions, as compared to the receipt of proceeds from the Term Loan of $168.9 million as of the borrowing date in Fiscal 2008; and a decrease in excess tax benefits from stock based compensation arrangements of $22.3 million in Fiscal 2009 as compared to the prior fiscal year. The above increases were partially offset by: a decrease in cash used in connection with repurchases of the Companys Class A common stock. In Fiscal 2009, 2.2 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $150.2 million (including approximately 0.4 million shares at a cost of $24.0 million that was traded prior to the end of Fiscal 2008 for which settlement occurred in April 2008) were repurchased pursuant to the Companys common stock repurchase program and 0.3 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $19.6 million were surrendered to, or withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the 1997 Plan. On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2008, $475.4 million of cash was used in connection with common stock repurchases and shares surrendered for tax withholdings. Liquidity The Companys primary sources of liquidity are the cash flow generated from its operations, $450 million of availability under its credit facility, available cash and cash equivalents, investments and other available financing options. These sources of liquidity are used to fund the Companys ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, global retail store expansion, construction and renovation of shop in shops, investment in technological infrastructure, acquisitions, joint ventures, dividends, debt repayment/repurchase, stock repurchases, contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax positions) and other corporate activities. Management believes that the Companys existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support its operating, capital and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, including the finalization of potential acquisitions and plans for business expansion. As discussed in the Debt and Covenant Compliance section below, the Company had no revolving credit borrowings outstanding under its credit facility as of April 3, 2010. As discussed further below, the Company may elect to draw on its credit facility or other potential sources of financing for, among other things, a material acquisition, settlement of a material contingency (including uncertain tax positions) or a material adverse business development, as well as for other general corporate business purposes. The Company believes its credit facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentrations in any one financial institution. In particular, as of April 3, 2010, there were 13 financial institutions participating in the credit facility, with no one participant maintaining a maximum commitment percentage in excess of approximately 20%. Management has no reason at this time to believe that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the Credit Facility (as defined below) in the event of the Companys election to draw funds in the foreseeable future. Common Stock Repurchase Program On November 4, 2009, the Companys Board of Directors approved an expansion of the Companys existing common stock repurchase program that allows the Company to repurchase up to an additional $225 million of Class A common stock. Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are subject to overall business and market conditions. In Fiscal 2010, 2.9 million shares of Class A common stock were repurchased by the Company at a cost of $215.9 million under its repurchase program. The remaining availability under the Companys common stock repurchase program was approximately $275 million as of April 3, 2010. In addition, in Fiscal 2010, 0.3 million 54 Table of Contents shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $15.1 million were surrendered to, or withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under the 1997 Plan. In Fiscal 2009, 1.8 million shares of Class A common stock were repurchased by the Company at a cost of $126.2 million. Also, during the first quarter of Fiscal 2009, 0.4 million shares traded prior to the end of Fiscal 2008 were settled at a cost of $24.0 million. In addition, in Fiscal 2009, 0.3 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $19.6 million were surrendered to, or withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under the 1997 Plan. In Fiscal 2008, share repurchases amounted to 6.1 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $476.4 million, including $24.0 million (0.4 million shares) that was traded prior to the end of the fiscal year for which settlement occurred in April 2008. In addition, in Fiscal 2008, 0.3 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $23.0 million were surrendered to, or withheld by, the Company in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under the 1997 Plan. On May 18, 2010, the Companys Board of Directors approved a further expansion of the Companys existing common stock repurchase program that allows the Company to repurchase up to an additional $275 million of Class A common stock. Dividends Since 2003, the Company has maintained a regular quarterly cash dividend program on its common stock. On November 4, 2009, the Companys Board of Directors approved an increase to the Companys quarterly cash dividend on its common stock from $0.05 per share to $0.10 per share. Dividends paid amounted to $24.7 million in Fiscal 2010, $19.9 million in Fiscal 2009 and $20.5 million in Fiscal 2008. The Company intends to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends on its outstanding common stock. However, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of the Companys Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, the Companys results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. Debt and Covenant Compliance Euro Debt As of April 3, 2010, the Company had outstanding 209.2 million principal amount of 4.5% notes due October 4, 2013 (the Euro Debt). The Company has the option to redeem all of the outstanding Euro Debt at any time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus a premium. The Company also has the option to redeem all of the outstanding Euro Debt at any time at par plus accrued interest in the event of certain developments involving U.S. tax law. Partial redemption of the Euro Debt is not permitted in either instance. In the event of a change of control of the Company, each holder of the Euro Debt has the option to require the Company to redeem the Euro Debt at its principal amount plus accrued interest. The indenture governing the Euro Debt (the Indenture) contains certain limited covenants that restrict the Companys ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur liens or enter into a sale and leaseback transaction for any principal property. The Indenture does not contain any financial covenants. As of April 3, 2010, the carrying value of the Euro Debt was $282.1 million, compared to $406.4 million as of March 28, 2009. In July 2009, the Company completed a cash tender offer and used $121.0 million to repurchase 90.8 million of principal amount of its then outstanding 300 million principal amount of 4.5% notes due October 4, 2013 at a discounted purchase price of approximately 95%. A net pretax gain of $4.1 million related to this extinguishment of debt was recorded during the second quarter of Fiscal 2010 and has been classified as a component of interest and other income, net, in the Companys consolidated statement of operations. The Company used its cash on hand to fund the debt extinguishment. 55 Table of Contents Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan The Company has a credit facility that provides for a $450 million unsecured revolving line of credit through November 2011 (the Credit Facility). The Credit Facility also is used to support the issuance of letters of credit. As of April 3, 2010, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the Company was contingently liable for $13.9 million of outstanding letters of credit (primarily relating to inventory purchase commitments). The Company has the ability to expand its borrowing availability to $600 million subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments. There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the Credit Facility. Borrowings under the Credit Facility bear interest, at the Companys option, either at (a) a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (i) the prime commercial lending rate of JP Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect from time to time and (ii) the weighted average overnight Federal funds rate (as published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York) plus 50 basis points or (b) a LIBOR rate in effect from time to time, as adjusted for the Federal Reserve Boards Euro currency liabilities maximum reserve percentage plus a margin defined in the Credit Facility (the applicable margin). The applicable margin of 35 basis points is subject to adjustment based on the Companys credit ratings. In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Credit Facility, the Company is required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate of 8 basis points under the terms of the Credit Facility also is subject to adjustment based on the Companys credit ratings. The Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict the Companys ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens and contingent liabilities; sell or dispose of assets, including equity interests; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not in a related line of business; make loans, advances or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make investments. The Credit Facility also requires the Company to maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to Consolidated EBITDAR (the leverage ratio) of no greater than 3.75 as of the date of measurement for four consecutive quarters. Adjusted Debt is defined generally as consolidated debt outstanding plus 8 times consolidated rent expense for the last twelve months. EBITDAR is defined generally as consolidated net income plus (i) income tax expense, (ii) net interest expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense and (iv) consolidated rent expense. As of April 3, 2010, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the Credit Facility) has occurred under the Companys Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the Credit Facility, and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The Credit Facility specifies a number of events of default (many of which are subject to applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure to make timely principal and interest payments or to satisfy the covenants, including the financial covenant described above. Additionally, the Credit Facility provides that an Event of Default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren, the Companys Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and entities controlled by the Lauren family fail to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power of the Companys common stock. The Credit Facility was amended and restated as of May 22, 2007 to provide for the addition of a 20.5 billion Term Loan, made to Polo JP Acqui B.V., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The proceeds of the Term Loan were used to finance the Companys acquisition of certain of its formerly licensed Japanese businesses. The Company repaid the Term Loan by its maturity date on May 22, 2008 using $196.8 million of the cash on hand acquired as part of the acquisition. See Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Japanese Business Acquisitions. Contractual and Other Obligations Firm Commitments The following table summarizes certain of the Companys aggregate contractual obligations as of April 3, 2010, and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on the Companys liquidity and cash flow in future periods. The Company expects to fund the firm commitments with operating cash flow generated 56 Table of Contents in the normal course of business and, if necessary, availability under its $450 million credit facility or other potential sources of financing. Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2016 and 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 Thereafter Total (millions) Euro debt $ $ $ 282.1 $ $ 282.1 Capital leases 9.9 13.9 12.4 46.0 82.2 Operating leases 205.6 394.2 354.2 877.3 1,831.3 Inventory purchase commitments 604.6 150.4 755.0 Total $ 820.1 $ 558.5 $ 648.7 $ 923.3 $ 2,950.6 The following is a description of the Companys material, firmly committed contractual obligations as of April 3, 2010: Euro debt represents the principal amount due at maturity of the Companys outstanding Euro Debt on a U.S. dollar equivalent basis. Amounts do not include any fair value adjustments, call premiums or interest payments; Lease obligations represent the minimum lease rental payments under noncancelable leases for the Companys real estate and operating equipment in various locations around the world. Approximately 60% of these lease obligations relates to the Companys retail operations. Information has been presented separately for operating and capital leases. In addition to such amounts, the Company is normally required to pay taxes, insurance and occupancy costs relating to its leased real estate properties; and Inventory purchase commitments represent the Companys legally binding agreements to purchase fixed or minimum quantities of goods at determinable prices. Excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the non current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $126.0 million as of April 3, 2010. This liability for unrecognized tax benefits has been excluded from the above table because the Company cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever. The above table also excludes the following: (i) amounts included in current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of April 3, 2010 as these items will be paid within one year; and (ii) non current liabilities that have no cash outflows associated with them (e.g., deferred revenue) or the cash outflows associated with them are uncertain or do not represent a purchase obligation as the term is used herein (e.g., deferred taxes and other miscellaneous items). The Company also has certain contractual arrangements that would require it to make payments if certain circumstances occur. See Note 17 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a description of the Companys contingent commitments not included in the above table. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Companys off balance sheet firm commitments, which include outstanding letters of credit and minimum funding commitments to investees, amounted to approximately $21 million as of April 3, 2010. The Company does not maintain any other off balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on its financial condition or results of operations. MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to a variety of risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain anticipated cash flows from its international operations and possible declines in the fair value of reported net assets of certain of its foreign operations, as well as changes in the fair value of its fixed rate debt relating to changes in interest rates. Consequently, in the normal course of business the Company employs established policies and 57 Table of Contents procedures, including the use of derivative financial instruments, to manage such risks. The Company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. As a result of the use of derivative instruments, the Company is exposed to the risk that counterparties to derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, the Company has a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other financial factors. The Companys established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk on derivative transactions include reviewing and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. As a result of the above considerations, the Company does not believe it is exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty risk with respect to its derivative contracts as of April 3, 2010. Foreign Currency Risk Management The Company manages its exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts. Refer to Note 16 to the audited consolidated financial statements for a summarization of the notional amounts and fair values of the Companys foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of April 3, 2010. Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts From time to time, the Company may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts as hedges to reduce its risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases, intercompany royalty payments made by certain of its international operations, intercompany contributions made to fund certain marketing efforts of its international operations, interest payments made in connection with outstanding debt, other foreign currency denominated operational obligations including payroll, rent, insurance and benefit payments, and foreign currency denominated revenues. As part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily to changes in the value of the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Swiss Franc, and the British Pound Sterling, the Company hedges a portion of its foreign currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing twelve month to two year periods. In doing so, the Company uses foreign currency exchange contracts that generally have maturities of three months to two years to provide continuing coverage throughout the hedging period. The Companys foreign exchange risk management activities are governed by policies and procedures approved by its Audit Committee. Our policies and procedures provide a framework that allows for the management of currency exposures while ensuring the activities are conducted within established Company guidelines. Our policies include guidelines for the organizational structure of our risk management function and for internal controls over foreign exchange risk management activities, including but not limited to authorization levels, transactional limits, and credit quality controls, as well as various measurements for monitoring compliance. We monitor foreign exchange risk using different techniques including a periodic review of market value and sensitivity analyses. The Company records its foreign currency exchange contracts at fair value in its consolidated balance sheets. To the extent foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at hedge inception are highly effective in offsetting the change in the value of the hedged item, the related gains (losses) are deferred in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. These deferred gains (losses) are then recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as follows: Forecasted Inventory Purchases Recognized as part of the cost of the inventory being hedged within cost of goods sold when the related inventory is sold. Intercompany Royalty Payments and Marketing Contributions Recognized within foreign currency gains (losses) in the period in which the related royalties or marketing contributions being hedged are received or paid. Operational Obligations Recognized primarily within SGA expenses in the period in which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. 58 Table of Contents Interest Payments on Euro Debt Recognized within foreign currency gains (losses) in the period in which the recorded liability impacts earnings due to foreign currency exchange remeasurement. The Company recognized net gains on foreign currency exchange contracts in earnings of approximately $13 million for Fiscal 2010, and net losses of approximately $6 million for Fiscal 2009 and $8 million for Fiscal 2008. Sensitivity The Company performs a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of the Companys derivative financial instruments. To perform the sensitivity analysis, the Company assesses the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This analysis assumes a like movement by all foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio against the U.S. dollar. Based on all foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of April 3, 2010, a 10% devaluation of the U.S. dollar as compared to the level of foreign currency exchange rates for currencies under contract as of April 3, 2010 would result in approximately $1 million of net unrealized losses. Conversely, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar would result in approximately $1 million of net unrealized gains. As the Companys outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts are primarily designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions, the unrealized loss or gain as a result of a 10% devaluation or appreciation would be largely offset by changes in the underlying hedged items. Hedge of a Net Investment in Certain European Subsidiaries The Company designated the entire principal amount of its outstanding Euro Debt as a hedge of its net investment in certain of its European subsidiaries. The changes in fair value of a derivative instrument or changes in a non derivative financial instrument (such as debt) that is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are reported in the same manner as a translation adjustment, to the extent it is effective as a hedge. As such, changes in the Euro Debt resulting from changes in the Euro exchange rate have been, and continue to be, reported in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company recorded within other comprehensive income the translation effects of the Euro Debt to U.S. dollars, resulting in a loss of $1.8 million for Fiscal 2010, a gain of $66.6 million for Fiscal 2009 and a loss of $73.8 million for Fiscal 2008. Interest Rate Risk Management Sensitivity As of April 3, 2010, the Company had no variable rate debt outstanding. As such, the Companys exposure to changes in interest rates primarily related to its fixed rate Euro Debt. As of April 3, 2010, the carrying value of the Euro Debt was $282.1 million and the fair value was $291.7 million. A 25 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of the Euro Debt by approximately $2 million. Such potential increases or decreases are based on certain simplifying assumptions, including no changes in Euro currency exchange rates and an immediate across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period. Investment Risk Management As of April 3, 2010, the Company had cash and cash equivalents on hand of $563.1 million, primarily invested in money market funds, time deposits and treasury bills with original maturities of 90 days or less. The Companys other significant investments included $584.1 million of short term investments, primarily in treasury bills, municipal bonds, time deposits and variable rate municipal securities with original maturities greater than 90 days; $75.4 million of restricted cash placed in escrow with certain banks as collateral primarily to secure guarantees in connection with certain international tax matters; $67.8 million of deposits with maturities greater than one year; $2.3 million of auction rate securities issued through a municipality and $5.4 million of other securities. The Company evaluates investments held in unrealized loss positions for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. Such evaluation involves a variety of considerations, including assessments of risks and 59 Table of Contents uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers. Factors considered by the Company include (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost, (ii) the financial condition, credit worthiness and near term prospects of the issuer, (iii) the length of time to maturity, (iv) future economic conditions and market forecasts, (v) the Companys intent and ability to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value, and (vi) an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that the Company will be required to sell its investment before recovery of market value. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The SECs Financial Reporting Release No. 60, Cautionary Advice Regarding Disclosure About Critical Accounting Policies (FRR 60), suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical. FRR 60 considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the Companys financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. The Companys estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. The Company believes that the following list represents its critical accounting policies as contemplated by FRR 60. For a discussion of all of the Companys significant accounting policies, see Notes 3 and 4 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements. Sales Reserves and Uncollectible Accounts A significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and net income is estimating sales reserves, which represent that portion of gross revenues not expected to be realized. In particular, wholesale revenue is reduced by estimates of returns, discounts, end of season markdowns and operational chargebacks. Retail revenue, including e commerce sales, also is reduced by estimates of returns. In determining estimates of returns, discounts, end of season markdowns and operational chargebacks, management analyzes historical trends, seasonal results, current economic and market conditions and retailer performance. The Company reviews and refines these estimates on a quarterly basis. The Companys historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. Similarly, management evaluates accounts receivables to determine if they will ultimately be collected. Significant judgments and estimates are involved in this evaluation, including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for larger accounts and customers, and a receivables aging analysis that determines the percentage of receivables that has historically been uncollected by aged category. Based on this information, management provides a reserve for the estimated amounts believed to be uncollectible. Although management believes that it has adequately provided for those risks as part of its bad debt reserve, a severe and prolonged adverse impact on its major customers business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on the Companys net sales, cash flows and or financial condition. See Accounts Receivable in Note 3 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the activity in the Companys sales reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts for each of the three fiscal years presented. Inventories The Company holds inventory that is sold through wholesale distribution channels to major department stores and specialty retail stores, including its own retail stores. The Company also holds retail inventory that is sold in its own stores directly to consumers. Wholesale and retail inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value with cost primarily determined on a weighted average cost basis. The Company continually evaluates the composition of its inventories, assessing slow turning product and fashion product. Estimated realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of the Companys individual product lines, the impact of market trends and economic conditions, and the value of 60 Table of Contents current orders in house relating to the future sales of inventory. Estimates may differ from actual results due to quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions. The Companys historical estimates of these costs and its provisions have not differed materially from actual results. Reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk over physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts. Business Combinations In December 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) topic 805, Business Combinations (ASC 805) (formerly referred to as Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (FAS) No. 141R, Business Combinations, as amended, which replaces FAS No. 141). ASC 805 establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, as well as the goodwill acquired. Significant changes resulting from ASC 805 include the need for the acquirer to record 100% of all assets and liabilities of the acquired business, including goodwill, generally at fair value for all business combinations (whether partial, full or step acquisitions); the need to recognize contingent consideration at fair value on the acquisition date and, for certain arrangements, to recognize changes in fair value in earnings until settlement; and the need for acquisition related transaction and restructuring costs to be expensed rather than treated as part of the cost of the acquisition. These fair value determinations require managements judgment and may involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 805 as of the beginning of Fiscal 2010 (March 29, 2009). See Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the effect of this accounting change on the Companys consolidated financial statements. In addition, in connection with its business acquisitions, the Company evaluates the terms of any pre existing relationships to determine if a settlement of the pre existing relationship exists. These pre existing relationships primarily relate to licensing agreements. If the terms of the pre existing relationships were determined to not be reflective of market, a settlement gain or loss would be recognized in earnings, measured by the amount in which the contract is favorable or unfavorable to the Company when compared with pricing for current market transactions for the same or similar items. The Company allocates the aggregate consideration exchanged in these transactions between the value of the business acquired and the value of the settlement of any pre existing relationships in proportion to estimates of their respective fair values. Accordingly, significant judgment is required to determine the respective fair values of the business acquired and the value of the settlement of the pre existing relationship. The Company may utilize independent valuation firms to assist in the determination of fair value. Fair Value Measurements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASC topic 820, Fair Value Measurements and Disclosures (ASC 820) (formerly referred to as FAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements, as amended). ASC 820 defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date within an identified principal or most advantageous market, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with US GAAP and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements through a three level valuation hierarchy. The Company adopted the provisions of ASC 820 for all of its financial assets and liabilities within scope as of the beginning of Fiscal 2009 (March 30, 2008). In addition, the Company adopted the provisions of ASC 820 for all of its nonfinancial assets and liabilities within scope as of the beginning of Fiscal 2010 (March 29, 2009). The Company uses judgment in the determination of the applicable level within the hierarchy of a particular asset or liability when evaluating the inputs used in valuation as of the measurement date, notably the extent to which the inputs are market based (observable) or internally derived (unobservable). See Notes 4 and 15 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the effect of this accounting change on the Companys consolidated financial statements. 61 Table of Contents Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill, including any goodwill included in the carrying value of investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually based on comparisons of their respective fair values to their carrying values. Finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired and performance of the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge. To assist management in the process of determining goodwill impairment, the Company reviews and considers appraisals from independent valuation firms. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons and recent transactions. These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting the risks inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables. The impairment test for other indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess. In addition, in evaluating finite lived intangible assets for recoverability, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value. The Company performed its annual impairment assessment of goodwill during the second quarter of Fiscal 2010. Based on the results of the impairment assessment as of June 28, 2009, the Company confirmed that the fair value of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and that there were no reporting units that were at risk of impairment. Additionally, there have been no impairment losses recorded in connection with the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets during any of the three fiscal years presented. Impairment of Other Long Lived Assets Property and equipment, along with other long lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In evaluating long lived assets for recoverability, the Company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net 62 Table of Contents cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. In determining future cash flows, the Company takes various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the emphasis on retail store cost controls, the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, and the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and increased local advertising. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations. During Fiscal 2010, Fiscal 2009 and Fiscal 2008, the Company recorded non cash impairment charges of $6.6 million, $55.4 million and $5.0 million, respectively, to reduce the net carrying value of certain long lived assets primarily in its Retail segment to their estimated fair value. See Note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Income Taxes Income taxes are provided using the asset and liability method. Under this method, income taxes (i.e., deferred tax assets and liabilities, current taxes payable/refunds receivable and tax expense) are recorded based on amounts refundable or payable in the current year and include the results of any difference between US GAAP and tax reporting. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating loss, capital loss and general business credit carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. The Company accounts for the financial effect of changes in tax laws or rates in the period of enactment. In addition, valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically and adjusted as events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments to those balances. In determining the income tax provision for financial reporting purposes, the Company establishes a reserve for uncertain tax positions. If the Company considers that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, it recognizes the tax benefit. The Company measures the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. These assessments can be complex and require significant judgment, and the Company often obtains assistance from external advisors. To the extent that the Companys estimates change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. If the initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, the Company regularly monitors its position and subsequently recognizes the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not, (ii) the statute of limitations expires, or (iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Uncertain tax positions are classified as current only when the Company expects to pay cash within the next twelve months. Interest and penalties, if any, are recorded within the provision for income taxes in the Companys consolidated statements of operations and are classified on the consolidated balance sheets with the related liability for unrecognized tax benefits. See Note 13 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the Companys income taxes. Contingencies The Company periodically is exposed to various contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting its business, including certain litigations, alleged information system security breach matters, contractual disputes, employee relation matters, various tax audits, and trademark and intellectual property matters and disputes. The Company records a liability for such contingencies to the extent that it concludes their occurrence is probable and 63 Table of Contents the related losses are estimable. In addition, if it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement of a contingency could exceed the established liability, the Company discloses the estimated impact on its liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Management considers many factors in making these assessments. As the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable, these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions. As a result, the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on estimates and assumptions. Stock Based Compensation The Company expenses all share based payments to employees and non employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Stock Options Stock options are granted to employees and non employee directors with exercise prices equal to fair market value at the date of grant. The Company uses the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. Certain key assumptions involve estimating future uncertain events. The key factors influencing the estimation process include the expected term of the option, the expected stock price volatility factor, the expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate, among others. Generally, once stock option values are determined, current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from the actuals. Determining the fair value of stock based compensation at the date of grant requires significant judgment by management, including estimates of the above Black Scholes assumptions. In addition, judgment is required in estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, if management changes its assumptions for future stock based award grants, or if there are changes in market conditions, stock based compensation expense and the Companys results of operations could be materially impacted. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) The Company grants restricted shares of Class A common stock and service based RSUs to certain of its senior executives and non employee directors. In addition, the Company grants performance based RSUs to such senior executives and other key executives, and certain other employees of the Company. The fair values of restricted stock shares and RSUs are based on the fair value of unrestricted Class A common stock, as adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for those restricted securities that are not entitled to dividend equivalents. Compensation expense for performance based RSUs is recognized over the related service period when attainment of the performance goals is deemed probable, which involves judgment on the part of management.
