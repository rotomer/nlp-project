OVERVIEW Our Business Our Company is a global leader in the design, marketing and distribution of premium lifestyle products including mens, womens and childrens apparel, accessories, fragrances and home furnishings. Our long standing 36 Table of Contents reputation and distinctive image have been consistently developed across an expanding number of products, brands and international markets. Our brand names include Polo Ralph Lauren, Ralph Lauren Purple Label, Ralph Lauren Womens Collection, Black Label, Blue Label, Lauren by Ralph Lauren, RRL, RLX, Rugby, Ralph Lauren Childrenswear, American Living, Chaps and Club Monaco, among others. We classify our businesses into three segments: Wholesale, Retail and Licensing. Our wholesale business (representing approximately 49% of Fiscal 2011 net revenues) consists of wholesale channel sales made principally to major department stores and specialty stores located throughout the U.S., Canada, Europe and Asia. Our retail business (representing approximately 48% of Fiscal 2011 net revenues) consists of retail channel sales directly to consumers through full price and factory retail stores located throughout the U.S., Canada, South America, Europe and Asia; through concessions based shop within shops located primarily in Asia; and through our domestic retail e commerce sites located at www.RalphLauren.com and www.Rugby.com, as well as our recently launched United Kingdom retail e commerce site located at www.RalphLauren.co.uk. In addition, our licensing business (representing approximately 3% of Fiscal 2011 net revenues) consists of royalty based arrangements under which we license the right to third parties to use our various trademarks in connection with the manufacture and sale of designated products, such as apparel, eyewear and fragrances, in specified geographical areas for specified periods. Approximately 33% of our Fiscal 2011 net revenues was earned in international regions outside of the U.S. and Canada. See Note 22 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a summary of net revenues by geographic location. Our business is typically affected by seasonal trends, with higher levels of wholesale sales in our second and fourth quarters and higher retail sales in our second and third quarters. These trends result primarily from the timing of seasonal wholesale shipments and key vacation travel, back to school and holiday shopping periods in the Retail segment. Our Objectives and Risks Our core strengths include a portfolio of global luxury lifestyle brands, a strong and experienced management team, a proven ability to develop and extend our brands distributed through multiple retail channels in global markets, a disciplined investment philosophy and a solid balance sheet. Despite the various risks and uncertainties associated with the current global economic environment as further discussed below, we believe our core strengths will allow us to continue to execute our strategy for long term sustainable growth in revenue, net income and operating cash flow. Our financial performance has been driven by our focus on six key objectives: Creating unique businesses primarily centered around one core and heritage driven brand; Diversifying and expanding our products and price points, distribution channels and geographic regions; Improving brand control and positioning; Focusing on selective strategic partnerships; Implementing infrastructure improvements that support a worldwide business; and Funding our expansion through strong operating cash flow. As our business has grown, our portfolio mix and brand control has evolved from primarily that of a mono brand U.S. centric menswear wholesaler with a broad array of product and geographic licenses to that of a portfolio of lifestyle brands with a direct control model over most of our brands, products and international territories. We believe that this broader and better diversified portfolio mix positions us for ongoing growth, offering our customers a range of products, price points and channels of distribution, and our size and global operations favorably position us to take advantage of synergies in design, sourcing and distribution. While balancing our long term key strategic objectives with our near term priorities to manage through the various risks associated with the current global economic environment, we intend to continue to pursue select 37 Table of Contents opportunities for growth during the course of Fiscal 2012 and beyond. These opportunities and continued investment initiatives include: International Growth Opportunities Ongoing development and growth of our recently acquired businesses in Asia, including the continued execution of our plans to expand our retail businesses and maximize our distribution opportunities in conjunction with the implementation of advertising and marketing strategies to elevate brand perception in certain of the markets in this region; and Continued growth of our European businesses, including the introduction of our Club Monaco product line and continued expansion of our Lauren product line across our wholesale distribution channels. Direct to Consumer Growth Opportunities Global expansion of our e commerce operations, including the continued expansion of our related operations in Europe and the introduction of e commerce in Asia. Product Innovation and Brand Extension Growth Opportunities Further development and broadening of our luxury accessories product offerings, including handbags, footwear, small leathergoods and watches/jewelry, and continued worldwide expansion of our eyewear distribution; Continued expansion of our Lauren, Club Monaco, Rugby, RRL and RLX product assortments across various categories on a global basis; Continued extension of our Home product lines, including within our wholesale distribution channels; and Worldwide expansion of our denim product offerings and associated distribution channels. Investment in Operational Infrastructure Further system enhancements and implementations to meet the expanding needs of our global organization, including the implementation of a new global financial and reporting system as part of a multi year initiative. Global Talent Development and Management Continue to enhance our organizational development and talent management to support our global growth initiatives, including the formalization of succession plans for key leadership positions. Disciplined Cost Management Continue to evaluate strategies to leverage higher sales volumes more efficiently and explore cost savings opportunities, including shared service initiatives. Global Economic Developments The state of the global economy continues to impact the level of consumer spending for discretionary items. This has affected our business as it is highly dependent on consumer demand for our products. While the U.S. and certain other international economies have shown signs of stabilization, there are still significant macroeconomic risks such as high rates of unemployment, rising fuel prices and continued global economic uncertainty, including in Japan where the recent earthquake and resulting tsunami and nuclear crisis have caused a significant disruption in economic conditions. While the degree to which recent events in Japan will affect the global economy remains uncertain at this time, the impact is expected to have a negative effect on the sales and operating margins of our Japanese operations in Fiscal 2012. Further, notwithstanding the reported sales and margin growth that we experienced during Fiscal 2011, we believe the global macroeconomic environment and the ongoing constrained level of worldwide consumer spending and modified consumption behavior will continue to have an impact on our business for the foreseeable future. In addition, during the second half of Fiscal 2011 and particularly in the fourth quarter, we experienced cost of goods inflation as a result of rising costs for raw materials, transportation and labor, as well as labor shortages in certain regions where our products are manufactured. While we continue to evaluate strategic initiatives to mitigate 38 Table of Contents increases in global labor rates and commodity pricing, we expect the increasing sourcing cost pressures to negatively affect the cost of most of our products and related gross profit percentages to a more significant degree in Fiscal 2012. We continue to monitor these risks and evaluate our operating strategies in order to adjust to changes in economic conditions. For a detailed discussion of significant risk factors that have the potential to cause our actual results to differ materially from our expectations, see Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Summary of Financial Performance Results of Operations In Fiscal 2011, we reported net revenues of $5.660 billion, net income attributable to Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation (PRLC) of $567.6 million and net income per diluted share attributable to PRLC of $5.75. This compares to net revenues of $4.979 billion, net income attributable to PRLC of $479.5 million and net income per diluted share attributable to PRLC of $4.73 in Fiscal 2010. Our operating performance for Fiscal 2011 was driven by 13.7% revenue growth, primarily due to increased comparable global retail store sales and the inclusion of revenues from both our Asia Pacific business acquired on December 31, 2009 and our South Korea business acquired on January 1, 2011 (see Recent Developments for further discussion), as well as higher revenues from our global wholesale businesses. These increases were partially offset by the absence of a 53rd week of sales as included in Fiscal 2010, as well as net unfavorable foreign currency effects. We also experienced an increase in gross profit percentage of 40 basis points to 58.6%, primarily due to higher levels of full price sell throughs and decreased promotional activity across most of our global retail businesses as well as growth from the largely concessions based business assumed in the Asia Pacific and South Korea acquisitions, partially offset by lower global wholesale margins. These increases were also partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative (SGA) expenses in Fiscal 2011, attributable largely to additional costs to support our growth in sales, as well as new business initiatives and acquisitions. Net income attributable to PRLC increased in Fiscal 2011 as compared to Fiscal 2010, primarily due to a $138.2 million increase in operating income, partially offset by a $48.0 million increase in the provision for income taxes. The increase in the provision in income taxes was primarily driven by the overall increase in pretax income, along with an 80 basis point increase in our effective tax rate. Net income per diluted share attributable to PRLC also increased due to the effect of higher net income coupled with lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding in Fiscal 2011. Our year over year results were also impacted by additional pretax income of approximately $19 million in Fiscal 2010 due to the inclusion of the 53rd week, which decreased our net income trends by approximately $13 million (approximately $0.13 per diluted share). Financial Condition and Liquidity Our financial position reflects the overall relative strength of our business results. We ended Fiscal 2011 in a net cash and investments position (total cash and cash equivalents plus short term and non current investments, less total debt) of $838.6 million, compared to $940.6 million as of the end of Fiscal 2010. The decrease in our net cash and investments position was primarily due to our treasury stock repurchases, capital expenditures and the funding of our recent South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition (as defined and discussed under Recent Developments below), partially offset by our operating cash flows and proceeds from stock option exercises. Our equity increased to $3.305 billion as of April 2, 2011 compared to $3.117 billion as of April 3, 2010, primarily due to our net income and other comprehensive income, offset in part by our share repurchase activity during Fiscal 2011. We generated $688.7 million of cash from operations during Fiscal 2011, compared to $906.5 million during Fiscal 2010. The decrease in operating cash flows primarily related to the timing of working capital changes, partially offset by an increase in net income before non cash expenses in Fiscal 2011. We used some of our cash availability to support our common stock repurchase program, to reinvest in our business through capital spending and to fund an acquisition. In particular, we used $594.6 million to repurchase 6.2 million shares of Class A common stock, including shares surrendered for tax withholdings; we used $255.0 million for capital expenditures 39 Table of Contents primarily associated with our global retail store expansion, construction and renovation of department store shop in shops, and investments in our facilities and technological infrastructure; and we used $47.0 million to fund our recent South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition (as defined and discussed under Recent Developments below). Transactions Affecting Comparability of Results of Operations and Financial Condition The comparability of our operating results for the three fiscal years presented herein has been affected by certain transactions, including: Acquisitions that occurred in Fiscal 2011, Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009. In particular, we completed the South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition on January 1, 2011, the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition on December 31, 2009, and the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition on August 1, 2008 (each as defined in Note 5 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements); Certain pretax charges related to asset impairments and restructurings during the fiscal years presented; and A net gain related to a partial extinguishment of our Euro denominated 4.5% notes in July 2009. A summary of the effect of certain of these items on pretax income for each applicable fiscal year presented is noted below (references to Notes are to the notes to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements): Fiscal Years Ended April 2, April 3, March 28, 2011 2010 2009 (millions) Impairments of assets (see Note 11) $ (2.5 ) $ (6.6 ) $ (55.4 ) Restructuring charges (see Note 12) (2.6 ) (6.9 ) (23.6 ) Gain on extinguishment of debt (see Note 14)(a) 4.1 $ (5.1 ) $ (9.4 ) $ (79.0 ) (a) Reported within interest and other income, net in our consolidated statement of operations. The comparability of our operating results has also been affected by the inclusion of a 53rd week in Fiscal 2010, which resulted in incremental revenues of approximately $70 million and additional net income of approximately $13 million in Fiscal 2010. The following discussion of operating results highlights, as necessary, the significant changes in operating results arising from these items and transactions. However, unusual items or transactions may occur in any period. Accordingly, investors and other financial statement users individually should consider the types of events and transactions that have affected operating trends. Recent Developments Greater China Restructuring Plan In May 2011, we initiated a restructuring plan to reposition our existing distribution network in the Greater China region, which is comprised of Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Macau. This plan is expected to be carried out primarily in Fiscal 2012 and include a reduction in workforce and the closure of certain retail stores and concession shops that do not support the new merchandising strategy. Actions related to the restructuring plan are anticipated to result in pretax charges of approximately $10 million to $20 million in Fiscal 2012. South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition On January 1, 2011, in connection with the transition of the Polo branded apparel and accessories business in South Korea (the Polo South Korea Business) from a licensed to a wholly owned operation, we acquired certain net assets (including inventory) and employees from Doosan Corporation (Doosan) in exchange for an initial payment of approximately $25 million plus an additional aggregate payment of approximately $22 million (the South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition). Doosan was our licensee for the Polo South Korea business. We funded the South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition with available cash on hand. In conjunction with the South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition, we also entered into a transition services agreement with Doosan for the provision of certain financial and information systems services for a period of up to twelve months commencing on January 1, 2011. 40 Table of Contents The operating results for the Polo South Korea business have been consolidated in our operating results commencing January 1, 2011 and are reported on a one month lag. The net effect of this reporting lag is not deemed to be material to our consolidated financial statements. Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition On December 31, 2009, in connection with the transition of the Polo branded apparel business in Asia Pacific (excluding Japan and South Korea) from a licensed to a wholly owned operation, we acquired certain net assets from Dickson Concepts International Limited and affiliates (Dickson) in exchange for an initial payment of approximately $20 million and other consideration of approximately $17 million (the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition). Dickson was our licensee for Polo branded apparel in the Asia Pacific region (excluding Japan and South Korea), which is comprised of China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Taiwan and Thailand. We funded the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition with available cash on hand. The operating results for the Polo branded apparel business in Asia Pacific have been consolidated in our operating results commencing January 1, 2010. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 The following table summarizes our results of operations and expresses the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain financial statement captions: Fiscal Years Ended April 2, April 3, 2011 2010 $ Change % Change (millions, except per share data) Net revenues $ 5,660.3 $ 4,978.9 $ 681.4 13.7 % Cost of goods sold(a) (2,342.0 ) (2,079.8 ) (262.2 ) 12.6 % Gross profit 3,318.3 2,899.1 419.2 14.5 % Gross profit as % of net revenues 58.6 % 58.2 % Selling, general and administrative expenses(a) (2,442.7 ) (2,157.0 ) (285.7 ) 13.2 % SGA as % of net revenues 43.2 % 43.3 % Amortization of intangible assets (25.4 ) (21.7 ) (3.7 ) 17.1 % Impairments of assets (2.5 ) (6.6 ) 4.1 (62.1 ) % Restructuring charges (2.6 ) (6.9 ) 4.3 (62.3 ) % Operating income 845.1 706.9 138.2 19.6 % Operating income as % of net revenues 14.9 % 14.2 % Foreign currency gains (losses) (1.4 ) (2.2 ) 0.8 (36.4 ) % Interest expense (18.3 ) (22.2 ) 3.9 (17.6 ) % Interest and other income, net 7.7 12.4 (4.7 ) (37.9 ) % Equity in income (loss) of equity method investees (7.7 ) (5.6 ) (2.1 ) 37.5 % Income before provision for income taxes 825.4 689.3 136.1 19.7 % Provision for income taxes (257.8 ) (209.8 ) (48.0 ) 22.9 % Effective tax rate(b) 31.2 % 30.4 % Net income attributable to PRLC $ 567.6 $ 479.5 $ 88.1 18.4 % Net income per common share attributable to PRLC: Basic $ 5.91 $ 4.85 $ 1.06 21.9 % Diluted $ 5.75 $ 4.73 $ 1.02 21.6 % (a) Includes total depreciation expense of $168.7 million and $159.5 million for Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, respectively. (b) Effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before provision for income taxes. Net Revenues. Net revenues increased by $681.4 million, or 13.7%, to $5.660 billion in Fiscal 2011 from $4.979 billion in Fiscal 2010. The increase was primarily due to higher revenues from our global retail and 41 Table of Contents wholesale businesses, partially offset by net unfavorable foreign currency effects. Excluding the effect of foreign currency, net revenues increased by 14.0%. Net revenues for our three business segments are provided below: Fiscal Years Ended April 2, April 3, 2011 2010 $ Change % Change (millions) Net Revenues: Wholesale $ 2,777.6 $ 2,532.4 $ 245.2 9.7 % Retail 2,704.2 2,263.1 441.1 19.5 % Licensing 178.5 183.4 (4.9 ) (2.7 )% Total net revenues $ 5,660.3 $ 4,978.9 $ 681.4 13.7 % Wholesale net revenues The net increase in revenues primarily reflects: a $208 million aggregate net increase in our domestic businesses primarily due to increased revenues from our menswear and womenswear product lines (offset in part by sales declines in related American Living product categories). In addition, our accessories product lines (including footwear) contributed to the increase in revenues, reflecting an increased presence at department store locations as well as additional product category offerings. These increases were partially offset by a planned reduction in sales for our off price channel business; a $62 million net increase in our European businesses on a constant currency basis primarily driven by increased revenues from our menswear and womenswear product lines; and The inclusion of $25 million of incremental revenues in connection with the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition, which was included in our results for the full year in Fiscal 2011 in comparison to three months in the prior fiscal year. The above net increase was partially offset by: a $25 million net decrease in our Japanese businesses on a constant currency basis driven by a decrease in womenswear sales; and a $25 million net decrease in revenues due to an unfavorable foreign currency effect related to the weakening of the Euro, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency effect related to the strengthening of the Yen, both in comparison to the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2011. Retail net revenues Within our discussion of Retail operating performance below, we refer to the measure comparable store sales. Comparable store sales refer to the growth of sales in stores that are open for at least one full fiscal year. Sales for stores that are closing during a fiscal year are excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales. Sales for stores that are either relocated, enlarged (as defined by gross square footage expansion of 25% or greater) or generally closed for 30 or more consecutive days for renovation are also excluded from the calculation of comparable store sales until such stores have been in their new location or in a newly renovated state for at least one full fiscal year. Comparable store sales information includes both Ralph Lauren (including Rugby) and Club Monaco stores, as well as concessions based shop within shops and RalphLauren.com (including Rugby.com). The net increase in Retail net revenues primarily reflects: a $259 million aggregate net increase in non comparable store sales primarily driven by: an increase of approximately $137 million related to the inclusion of a full year of revenues from stores and concession based shop within shops assumed in connection with the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations acquisition, in comparison to three months in the prior fiscal year; the inclusion of approximately $22 million of revenues from stores and concession based shop within shops assumed in connection with the South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition; 42 Table of Contents a net aggregate favorable foreign currency effect of approximately $8 million, primarily related to the strengthening of the Yen, partially offset by the overall weakening of the Euro, both in comparison to the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2011; and an increase related to a number of new international full price and factory store openings within the past twelve months, including our flagship stores on Madison Avenue in New York and in Saint Germain, Paris, as well as our recently launched United Kingdom retail e commerce site. Excluding those stores and shops assumed in connection with the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition and the South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition (both as discussed above), our average global physical store count increased by 35 stores and concession shops as compared to Fiscal 2010. Our total physical store count as of April 2, 2011 included 367 freestanding stores and 510 concession shops, including 4 stores and 178 concession shops relating to the South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition. a $134 million aggregate net increase in comparable physical store sales primarily driven by our global factory stores, including a net aggregate favorable foreign currency effect of approximately $1 million primarily related to the strengthening of the Yen, largely offset by the overall weakening of the Euro, both in comparison to the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2011. The increase in Retail net revenues was also due to a $48 million increase in RalphLauren.com sales. Comparable store sales are presented below on a 52 week basis: Fiscal Year Ended April 2, 2011 Increases in comparable store sales as reported: Full price Ralph Lauren store sales(a) 1 % Full price Club Monaco store sales 14 % Factory store sales 10 % RalphLauren.com sales 23 % Total increase in comparable store sales as reported 10 % Increases in comparable store sales excluding the effect of foreign currency: Full price Ralph Lauren store sales(b) 0 % Full price Club Monaco store sales 14 % Factory store sales 11 % RalphLauren.com sales 23 % Total increase in comparable store sales excluding the effect of foreign currency 10 % (a) Includes a decrease of 3% in comparable sales for concessions based shop within shops. (b) Includes a decrease of 11% in comparable sales for concessions based shop within shops. Licensing revenue The net decrease in revenues primarily reflects: an $8 million decrease in international licensing royalties primarily due to the recent Asia Pacific and South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisitions; and a $4 million decrease in home licensing royalties primarily driven by lower paint related royalties. The above net decrease was partially offset by: a $7 million increase in domestic product licensing royalties primarily driven by higher footwear related and fragrance related royalties. Gross Profit. Cost of goods sold includes the expenses incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale, including product costs, freight in and import costs, as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory realizability. The costs of selling merchandise, including those associated with preparing the merchandise for sale, such as picking, packing, warehousing and order charges, are included in SGA expenses. Gross profit increased by $419.2 million, or 14.5%, to $3.318 billion in Fiscal 2011 from $2.899 billion in Fiscal 2010. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased by 40 basis points to 58.6% in Fiscal 2011 from 43 Table of Contents 58.2% in Fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily due to higher levels of full price sell throughs and decreased promotional activity across most of our global retail businesses, as well as growth from the retail businesses assumed in the Asia Pacific and South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisitions. The increase in gross profit as a percentage of net revenues was partially offset by lower global wholesale margins, driven by sourcing cost pressures experienced during the second half of Fiscal 2011. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in material costs. These factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year. We expect that current macroeconomic challenges, including inflationary pressures on raw material and labor costs as well as labor shortages in certain regions where our products are manufactured, will negatively affect the cost of our products and related gross profit percentages to a more significant degree in Fiscal 2012. See Global Economic Developments and Item 1A Risk Factors for further discussion. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SGA expenses primarily include compensation and benefits, marketing, distribution, bad debts, information technology, facilities, legal and other costs associated with finance and administration. SGA expenses increased by $285.7 million, or 13.2%, to $2.443 billion in Fiscal 2011 from $2.157 billion in Fiscal 2010. This increase included a net unfavorable foreign currency effect of approximately $6 million primarily related to strengthening of the Yen, partially offset by the weakening of the Euro, both in comparison to the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2011. SGA expenses as a percent of net revenues decreased slightly to 43.2% in Fiscal 2011 as compared to 43.3% in Fiscal 2010, reflecting the operating leverage of the increase in our net revenues and our disciplined expense management, which more than offset the increase in operating expenses attributable to our new business initiatives and acquisitions. The $285.7 million increase in SGA expenses was primarily driven by: the inclusion of additional SGA costs of approximately $108 million related to our newly acquired Polo branded businesses in Asia, including $88 million of incremental costs related to the inclusion of a full year of SGA costs associated with the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition in comparison to three months in the prior fiscal year, and $20 million of SGA and acquisition related costs related to our recent South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition; higher selling salaries and compensation related costs of approximately $104 million primarily related to the global increase in Retail sales and worldwide store expansion, as well as higher incentive based and stock based compensation expenses; increased brand related marketing and advertising costs of approximately $30 million; increased consulting costs of approximately $23 million, including costs relating to new global information technology systems; an approximate $14 million increase in rent and utility costs primarily to support the ongoing global growth of our businesses; and increased selling expenses of approximately $10 million to support increased sales. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets increased by $3.7 million, or 17.1%, to $25.4 million in Fiscal 2011 from $21.7 million in Fiscal 2010. This increase was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in connection with the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition in comparison to three months in the prior fiscal year, as well as the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition. Impairments of Assets. A non cash impairment charge of $2.5 million was recognized in Fiscal 2011 to reduce the net carrying values of certain retail store and concession shop long lived assets in the Asia Pacific region that were determined to no longer be used over the intended service period to their estimated fair value. During Fiscal 2010, we recognized a non cash impairment charge of $6.6 million to reduce the net carrying values of certain long lived assets primarily in our Retail segment to their estimated fair values due to the underperformance 44 Table of Contents of certain domestic retail stores. See Note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Restructuring Charges. Restructuring charges of $2.6 million for Fiscal 2011 primarily related to employee termination costs associated with our wholesale operations and the closing of a warehouse facility, partially offset by reversals of reserves deemed no longer necessary largely associated with previously closed retail stores. Restructuring charges of $6.9 million for Fiscal 2010 primarily related to employee termination costs, as well as the write down of an asset associated with exiting a retail store in Japan. See Note 12 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Operating Income. Operating income increased by $138.2 million, or 19.6%, to $845.1 million in Fiscal 2011 from $706.9 million in Fiscal 2010. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues increased 70 basis points, to 14.9% in Fiscal 2011 from 14.2% in Fiscal 2010. The increase in operating income as a percentage of net revenues primarily reflected the increase in our overall gross profit margin, as previously discussed. Operating income and margin for our three business segments is provided below: Fiscal Years Ended April 2, 2011 April 3, 2010 Operating Operating Operating Operating $ Margin Income Margin Income Margin Change Change (millions) (millions) (millions) Segment: Wholesale $ 612.3 22.0 % $ 585.3 23.1 % $ 27.0 (1.1 )% Retail 387.8 14.3 % 254.1 11.2 % 133.7 3.1 % Licensing 108.3 60.7 % 107.4 58.6 % 0.9 2.1 % 1,108.4 946.8 161.6 Less: Unallocated corporate expenses (262.1 ) (229.9 ) (32.2 ) Unallocated legal and restructuring charges, net (1.2 ) (10.0 ) 8.8 Total operating income $ 845.1 14.9 % $ 706.9 14.2 % $ 138.2 0.7 % Wholesale operating margin decreased by 110 basis points, primarily as a result of lower global gross profit margins reflecting cost pressures experienced during the second half of Fiscal 2011, partially offset by a decrease in SGA expenses as a percentage of net revenues due to improved operating leverage. Retail operating margin increased by 310 basis points, primarily as a result of higher gross profit margins across most of our global retail businesses primarily driven by higher levels of full price sell throughs and decreased promotional activity across most of our global retail businesses. This increase was partially offset by increased SGA expenses as a percentage of revenues, primarily driven by increased salaries and compensation related costs, rent expenses and marketing and advertising expenses to support the ongoing growth of our global Retail businesses. Licensing operating margin increased by 210 basis points, primarily as a result of lower net costs associated with the transition of our licensed businesses to wholly owned operations, as well as lower revenues. Unallocated corporate expenses increased by $32.2 million, primarily as a result of higher incentive based and stock based compensation expenses, increased information technology costs and higher charitable contributions. Unallocated legal and restructuring charges, net for Fiscal 2011 included net unallocated restructuring charges of $2.6 million that were partially offset by $1.4 million of net reversals of legal reserves deemed no longer necessary. Fiscal 2010 included restructuring charges of $6.9 million and legal charges of $4.8 million primarily related to our California Labor Litigation matter, offset in part by the reversal of an excess legal reserve of $1.7 million (see Note 17 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion). 45 Table of Contents Foreign Currency Gains (Losses). The effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss of $1.4 million in Fiscal 2011, compared to a loss of $2.2 million in Fiscal 2010. Excluding the net increase in losses of $5.5 million relating to foreign currency hedge contracts, the overall reduction in foreign currency losses was primarily due to the timing of the settlement of foreign currency denominated third party and intercompany receivables and payables (that were not of a long term investment nature). Foreign currency gains and losses are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. Interest Expense. Interest expense includes the borrowing costs of our outstanding debt, including amortization of debt issuance costs, and interest related to our capital lease obligations. Interest expense decreased by $3.9 million, or 17.6%, to $18.3 million in Fiscal 2011 from $22.2 million in Fiscal 2010. This decrease was primarily due to a lower principal amount of our outstanding Euro denominated 4.5% notes as a result of a partial debt extinguishment in July 2009 and reduced interest rates as a result of a fixed to floating interest rate swap entered into during the first quarter of Fiscal 2011, as well as the favorable foreign currency effect resulting from the weakening of the Euro during Fiscal 2011. Interest and Other Income, net. Interest and other income, net, decreased by $4.7 million, or 37.9%, to $7.7 million in Fiscal 2011 from $12.4 million in Fiscal 2010, primarily due to the prior year gain of $4.1 million related to the partial extinguishment of our Euro denominated 4.5% notes. The decline in interest and other income, net was also driven by a net unfavorable foreign currency effect resulting from the weakening of the Euro and lower average yields on our cash and cash equivalents during Fiscal 2011. Equity in Income (Loss) of Equity Method Investees. The equity in loss of equity method investees of $7.7 million and $5.6 million recognized in Fiscal 2011 and Fiscal 2010, respectively, related to our share of losses from our joint venture, the Ralph Lauren Watch and Jewelry Company, S.A.R.L. (the RL Watch Company), which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by $48.0 million, or 22.9%, to $257.8 million in Fiscal 2011 from $209.8 million in Fiscal 2010. The increase in the provision for income taxes was principally due to an overall increase in pretax income in Fiscal 2011 and an increase in our reported effective tax rate of 80 basis points, to 31.2% in Fiscal 2011 from 30.4% in Fiscal 2010. The higher effective tax rate was primarily due to a greater proportion of earnings generated in higher taxed jurisdictions for Fiscal 2011. Our effective tax rate in both years was favorably impacted by reductions in tax reserves associated with conclusions of tax examinations and other discrete tax reserve reductions. The effective tax rate differs from statutory rates due to the effect of state and local taxes, tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses. Our effective tax rate will change from year to year based on non recurring factors including, but not limited to, the geographic mix of earnings, the timing and amount of foreign dividends, enacted tax legislation, state and local taxes, tax audit findings and settlements, and the interaction of various global tax strategies. Net Income Attributable to PRLC. Net income increased by $88.1 million, or 18.4%, to $567.6 million in Fiscal 2011 from $479.5 million in Fiscal 2010, primarily related to the $138.2 million increase in operating income, partially offset by the $48.0 million increase in the provision for income taxes, as previously discussed. These results were impacted by increased pretax income of approximately $19 million in Fiscal 2010 due to the inclusion of the 53rd week, which decreased net income trends by approximately $13 million. Net Income Per Diluted Share Attributable to PRLC. Net income per diluted share increased by $1.02, or 21.6%, to $5.75 per share in Fiscal 2011 from $4.73 per share in Fiscal 2010, due to the higher level of net income, as previously discussed, and lower weighted average diluted shares outstanding primarily driven by share repurchases during Fiscal 2011. These results were impacted by increased pretax income of approximately $19 million in Fiscal 2010 due to the inclusion of the 53rd week, which decreased net income per diluted share trends by approximately $0.13. 46 Table of Contents Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 The following table summarizes our results of operations and expresses the percentage relationship to net revenues of certain financial statement captions: Fiscal Years Ended April 3, March 28, 2010 2009 $ Change % Change (millions, except per share data) Net revenues $ 4,978.9 $ 5,018.9 $ (40.0 ) (0.8 )% Cost of goods sold(a) (2,079.8 ) (2,288.2 ) 208.4 (9.1 )% Gross profit 2,899.1 2,730.7 168.4 6.2 % Gross profit as % of net revenues 58.2 % 54.4 % Selling, general and administrative expenses(a) (2,157.0 ) (2,036.0 ) (121.0 ) 5.9 % SGA as % of net revenues 43.3 % 40.6 % Amortization of intangible assets (21.7 ) (20.2 ) (1.5 ) 7.4 % Impairments of assets (6.6 ) (55.4 ) 48.8 (88.1 )% Restructuring charges (6.9 ) (23.6 ) 16.7 (70.8 )% Operating income 706.9 595.5 111.4 18.7 % Operating income as % of net revenues 14.2 % 11.9 % Foreign currency gains (losses) (2.2 ) 1.6 (3.8 ) (237.5 )% Interest expense (22.2 ) (26.6 ) 4.4 (16.5 )% Interest and other income, net 12.4 22.0 (9.6 ) (43.6 )% Equity in income (loss) of equity method investees (5.6 ) (5.0 ) (0.6 ) 12.0 % Income before provision for income taxes 689.3 587.5 101.8 17.3 % Provision for income taxes (209.8 ) (181.5 ) (28.3 ) 15.6 % Effective tax rate(b) 30.4 % 30.9 % Net income attributable to PRLC $ 479.5 $ 406.0 $ 73.5 18.1 % Net income per common share attributable to PRLC: Basic $ 4.85 $ 4.09 $ 0.76 18.6 % Diluted $ 4.73 $ 4.01 $ 0.72 18.0 % (a) Includes total depreciation expense of $159.5 million and $164.2 million for Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009, respectively. (b) Effective tax rate is calculated by dividing the provision for income taxes by income before provision for income taxes. Net Revenues. Net revenues decreased by $40.0 million, or 0.8%, to $4.979 billion in Fiscal 2010 from $5.019 billion in Fiscal 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower revenues from our global Wholesale businesses, partially offset by a net increase in our global Retail sales and net favorable foreign currency effects. Also offsetting the decrease in revenues was the inclusion of a 53rd week in Fiscal 2010 compared to 52 weeks in Fiscal 2009, which resulted in incremental revenues of approximately $70 million. Excluding the effect of foreign currency, net revenues decreased by 1.1%. Net revenues for our three business segments are provided below: Fiscal Years Ended April 3, March 28, 2010 2009 $ Change % Change (millions) Net Revenues: Wholesale $ 2,532.4 $ 2,749.5 $ (217.1 ) (7.9 )% Retail 2,263.1 2,074.2 188.9 9.1 % Licensing 183.4 195.2 (11.8 ) (6.0 )% Total net revenues $ 4,978.9 $ 5,018.9 $ (40.0 ) (0.8 )% 47 Table of Contents Wholesale net revenues The net decrease primarily reflects: a $154 million aggregate net decrease in our domestic businesses primarily due to a decrease in womenswear, menswear and childrenswear sales (including a decline in revenues from related American Living product categories) as a result of the ongoing challenging U.S. retail environment, offset in part by higher footwear sales driven by increased door penetration; a $36 million net decrease in our Japanese businesses on a constant currency basis primarily due to a decrease in womenswear sales largely as a result of the ongoing challenging global retail environment; a $25 million net decrease in our European businesses on a constant currency basis primarily driven by decreased sales in our menswear and childrenswear product lines, partially offset by an increase in womenswear sales largely due to the inclusion of revenues from the newly launched Lauren product line; and a $2 million net decrease in revenues due to an unfavorable foreign currency effect related to the overall weakening of the Euro, partially offset by a favorable foreign currency effect related to the strengthening of the Yen, both in comparison to the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2010. The total net decrease in Wholesale revenues discussed above included an approximate $30 million increase due to the inclusion of an extra week of sales in Fiscal 2010 as compared to Fiscal 2009. Retail net revenues The net increase in Retail net revenues primarily reflects: a $163 million aggregate net increase in non comparable store sales primarily driven by: a $40 million increase in revenues due to the inclusion of an extra week of sales in Fiscal 2010 as compared to Fiscal 2009; an increase of approximately $32 million on a constant currency basis related to the inclusion of a full year of revenues from our concessions based shop within shops assumed in connection with the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition in comparison to seven months in the prior fiscal year; the inclusion of $29 million of sales from stores and concessions based shop within shops assumed in connection with the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition; an increase related to new store openings within the past twelve months. There was a net increase in average global store count of 9 stores, to a total of 350 stores, as compared to Fiscal 2009. The net increase in store count was primarily due to a number of new domestic and international full price and factory store openings as well as the inclusion of stores acquired in the Asia Pacific region, offset in part by the closure of certain Club Monaco stores; and a net aggregate favorable foreign currency effect of $16 million primarily related to the strengthening of the Yen, partially offset by the overall weakening of the Euro, both in comparison to the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2010. a $6 million aggregate net decrease in comparable physical store sales driven by our global full price stores, including a net aggregate unfavorable foreign currency effect of $2 million primarily related to the overall weakening of the Euro, partially offset by the strengthening of the Yen, both in comparison to the U.S. dollar 48 Table of Contents during Fiscal 2010. This decrease was more than offset by a $32 million increase in RalphLauren.com sales. Comparable store sales are presented below on a 52 week basis: Fiscal Year Ended April 3, 2010 Increases/(decreases) in comparable store sales as reported: Full price Ralph Lauren store sales(a) (4 )% Full price Club Monaco store sales 2 % Factory store sales 1 % RalphLauren.com sales 18 % Total increase in comparable store sales as reported 1 % Increases/(decreases) in comparable store sales excluding the effect of foreign currency: Full price Ralph Lauren store sales(b) (4 )% Full price Club Monaco store sales 2 % Factory store sales 1 % RalphLauren.com sales 18 % Total increase in comparable store sales excluding the effect of foreign currency 2 % (a) Includes an increase of 24% in comparable sales for concessions based shop within shops. (b) Includes an increase of 15% in comparable sales for concessions based shop within shops. Licensing revenue The net decrease primarily reflects: a $8 million decrease in international licensing royalties, primarily due to the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition as well as the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition; and a $5 million decrease in home licensing royalties primarily driven by lower paint and bedding and bath related royalties. The above net decrease was partially offset by: a $1 million net increase in product licensing royalties primarily driven by higher footwear royalties, partially offset by lower fragrance related royalties. Gross Profit. Gross profit increased by $168.4 million, or 6.2%, to $2.899 billion in Fiscal 2010 from $2.731 billion in Fiscal 2009. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues increased by 380 basis points to 58.2% in Fiscal 2010 from 54.4% in Fiscal 2009. This increase was primarily due to supply chain cost savings initiatives, improved inventory management and decreased promotional activity particularly across our global retail businesses and our European wholesale operations, as well as growth in our Japanese concessions based business driven by the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition. Gross profit as a percentage of net revenues is dependent upon a variety of factors, including changes in the relative sales mix among distribution channels, changes in the mix of products sold, the timing and level of promotional activities, foreign currency exchange rates, and fluctuations in material costs. These factors, among others, may cause gross profit as a percentage of net revenues to fluctuate from year to year. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. SGA expenses increased by $121.0 million, or 5.9%, to $2.157 billion in Fiscal 2010 from $2.036 billion in Fiscal 2009. This increase included an unfavorable foreign currency effect of approximately $15 million, primarily related to the strengthening of the Yen in comparison to the U.S. dollar during Fiscal 2010. SGA expenses as a percent of net revenues increased to 43.3% in Fiscal 2010 from 40.6% in Fiscal 2009. The 270 basis point increase was primarily driven by the decrease in net revenues, as well as higher compensation related expenses and an increase in operating expenses attributable to our new business 49 Table of Contents initiatives. Including the $15 million unfavorable foreign currency effect, the $121.0 million increase in SGA expenses was primarily driven by: higher compensation related expenses of approximately $78 million primarily relating to an increase in incentive based compensation; the inclusion of SGA costs of approximately $35 million associated with the recent Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition; an approximate $22 million increase related to the inclusion of a full year of SGA costs for our recently acquired Japanese childrenswear and golf businesses in comparison to seven months in the prior fiscal year, including costs incurred pursuant to transition service arrangements; and an approximate $17 million increase in rent and utility costs primarily to support the ongoing global growth of our businesses. The above increases were partially offset by lower SGA expenses associated with our cost savings initiatives implemented in late Fiscal 2009, as well as: lower selling expenses of approximately $28 million principally relating to lower wholesale sales; and an approximate $14 million decrease in brand related marketing and advertising costs. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Amortization of intangible assets increased by $1.5 million, or 7.4%, to $21.7 million in Fiscal 2010 from $20.2 million in Fiscal 2009. This increase was primarily due to the inclusion of a full year of amortization expense related to intangible assets acquired in connection with the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition in comparison to seven months in the prior fiscal year, as well as amortization of the intangible assets acquired in connection with the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition. Impairments of Assets. A non cash impairment charge of $6.6 million was recognized in Fiscal 2010, compared to $55.4 million in Fiscal 2009. These charges reduced the net carrying values of certain long lived assets, primarily in our Retail segment, to their estimated fair values. These impairment charges were primarily attributable to the lower than expected operating performances of certain retail stores, which in Fiscal 2009 arose in large part due to the significant contraction in consumer spending experienced during the latter half of that fiscal year. See Note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Restructuring Charges. Restructuring charges of $6.9 million recognized in Fiscal 2010 primarily related to employee termination costs, as well as the write down of an asset associated with exiting a retail store in Japan. Restructuring charges of $23.6 million recognized in Fiscal 2009 were primarily associated with a restructuring plan initiated during the fourth quarter of Fiscal 2009 to better align our cost base with lower sales and operating margin trends associated with the slowdown in consumer spending, and to improve overall operating effectiveness (the Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan). This Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan included a reduction in workforce and the closure of certain underperforming retail stores. See Note 12 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Operating Income. Operating income increased by $111.4 million, or 18.7%, to $706.9 million in Fiscal 2010 from $595.5 million in Fiscal 2009. Operating income as a percentage of net revenues increased 230 basis points, to 14.2% in Fiscal 2010 from 11.9% in Fiscal 2009. The increase in operating income as a percentage of net revenues primarily reflected the increase in gross profit margin and lower pretax charges related to asset impairments and restructurings, partially offset by the increase in SGA expenses as a percent of net revenues, as previously discussed. 50 Table of Contents Operating income for our three business segments is provided below: Fiscal Years Ended April 3, March 28, 2010 2009 $ Change % Change (millions) Operating Income: Wholesale $ 585.3 $ 619.9 $ (34.6 ) (5.6 )% Retail 254.1 101.6 152.5 150.1 % Licensing 107.4 103.6 3.8 3.7 % 946.8 825.1 121.7 14.7 % Less: Unallocated corporate expenses (229.9 ) (206.5 ) (23.4 ) 11.3 % Unallocated legal and restructuring charges (10.0 ) (23.1 ) 13.1 (56.7 )% Total operating income $ 706.9 $ 595.5 $ 111.4 18.7 % Wholesale operating income decreased by $34.6 million primarily as a result of lower revenues, partially offset by higher gross margins driven by improved inventory management principally in our European businesses. Retail operating income increased by $152.5 million primarily as a result of increased revenues and higher gross margins across our global Retail businesses driven by decreased promotional activity and lower reductions in the carrying cost of our retail inventory. The increase was also due to lower impairment related charges. These increases were partially offset by increased SGA expenses primarily driven by higher rent and incentive based compensation expenses. Licensing operating income increased by $3.8 million primarily as a result of lower net costs associated with the transition of our licensed businesses to wholly owned operations, offset in part by lower revenues largely driven by a decline in international royalties and home licensing royalties. Unallocated corporate expenses increased by $23.4 million, primarily as a result of higher incentive based compensation expenses, partially offset by lower brand related marketing and advertising costs. Unallocated legal and restructuring charges of $10.0 million in Fiscal 2010 were comprised of restructuring charges of $6.9 million primarily related to employee termination costs and the write down of an asset associated with exiting a retail store in Japan, as well as legal charges of $4.8 million primarily related to our California Labor Litigation matter offset in part by the reversal of an excess legal reserve of $1.7 million (see Note 17 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion). In Fiscal 2009, unallocated legal and restructuring charges of $23.1 million were comprised of restructuring charges of $23.6 million primarily associated with the Fiscal 2009 Restructuring Plan, as previously discussed, offset by a reversal of an excess legal reserve in the amount of $0.5 million. Foreign Currency Gains (Losses). The effect of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations resulted in a loss of $2.2 million in Fiscal 2010, compared to a gain of $1.6 million in Fiscal 2009. Excluding a net increase in foreign currency gains of $1.0 million relating to undesignated foreign currency hedge contracts, the increase in foreign currency losses in Fiscal 2010 as compared to Fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the timing of the settlement of intercompany receivables and payables (that were not of a long term investment nature) between certain of our international and domestic subsidiaries. Foreign currency gains and losses are unrelated to the impact of changes in the value of the U.S. dollar when operating results of our foreign subsidiaries are translated to U.S. dollars. Interest Expense. Interest expense decreased by $4.4 million, or 16.5%, to $22.2 million in Fiscal 2010 from $26.6 million in Fiscal 2009. This decrease was primarily due to a lower principal amount of our outstanding Euro denominated 4.5% notes as a result of a partial debt extinguishment in July 2009. Interest and Other Income, net. Interest and other income, net, decreased by $9.6 million, or 43.6%, to $12.4 million in Fiscal 2010 from $22.0 million in Fiscal 2009, primarily due to lower yields relating to lower market rates of interest. This decrease was offset in part by an increase in our average balance of cash and cash 51 Table of Contents equivalents and investments during Fiscal 2010, as well as a net gain of $4.1 million related to a partial extinguishment of our Euro denominated 4.5% notes in July 2009. Equity in Income (Loss) of Equity Method Investees. The equity in loss of equity method investees of $5.6 million in Fiscal 2010 related to our share of loss from our joint venture, the RL Watch Company, which is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The equity in loss of equity method investees of $5.0 million in Fiscal 2009 related to our share of loss driven by certain start up costs associated with the RL Watch Company. Provision for Income Taxes. The provision for income taxes represents federal, foreign, state and local income taxes. The provision for income taxes increased by $28.3 million, or 15.6%, to $209.8 million in Fiscal 2010 from $181.5 million in Fiscal 2009. The increase in provision for income taxes was primarily a result of higher pretax income in Fiscal 2010 compared to Fiscal 2009. This increase was partially offset by a net decline in our reported effective tax rate of 50 basis points, to 30.4% in Fiscal 2010 from 30.9% in Fiscal 2009. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to a greater proportion of earnings generated in lower taxed jurisdictions as well as tax reserve reductions principally associated with audit settlements, offset in part by certain higher non deductible expenses. Net Income Attributable to PRLC. Net income increased by $73.5 million, or 18.1%, to $479.5 million in Fiscal 2010 from $406.0 million in Fiscal 2009. The increase in net income was primarily due to a $111.4 million increase in operating income, offset in part by a $28.3 million increase in the provision for income taxes, as previously discussed. These results were impacted by a $65.5 million reduction in pretax charges related to asset impairments and restructurings as well as increased pretax income of approximately $19 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2010, which combined had an aggregate effect of increasing our net income trends by approximately $54 million. Net Income Per Diluted Share Attributable to PRLC. Net income per diluted share increased by $0.72, or 18.0%, to $4.73 per share in Fiscal 2010 from $4.01 per share in Fiscal 2009. The increase in diluted per share results was due to the higher level of net income, as previously discussed. These results were impacted by a $65.5 million reduction in pretax charges related to asset impairments and restructurings as well as increased pretax income of approximately $19 million due to the inclusion of the 53rd week in Fiscal 2010, which combined had an aggregate effect of increasing our net income per diluted share trends by approximately $0.53. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Financial Condition April 2, April 3, 2011 2010 $ Change (millions) Cash and cash equivalents $ 453.0 $ 563.1 $ (110.1 ) Short term investments 593.9 584.1 9.8 Non current investments 83.6 75.5 8.1 Long term debt (291.9 ) (282.1 ) (9.8 ) Net cash and investments(a) $ 838.6 $ 940.6 $ (102.0 ) Equity $ 3,304.7 $ 3,116.6 $ 188.1 (a) Net cash and investments is defined as total cash and cash equivalents, plus short term and non current investments, less total debt. The decrease in our net cash and investments position as of April 2, 2011 as compared to April 3, 2010 was primarily due to our use of cash to support treasury stock repurchases, capital expenditures and the funding of an acquisition, partially offset by our operating cash flows and proceeds from stock option exercises. Particularly, in Fiscal 2011, we used $594.6 million to repurchase 6.2 million shares of Class A common stock, including shares surrendered for tax withholdings, and spent $255.0 million for capital expenditures. In addition, we used $47.0 million to fund our recent South Korea Licensed Operations Acquisition. 52 Table of Contents The increase in equity was primarily attributable to our net income in Fiscal 2011, offset in part by an increase in treasury stock as a result of our common stock repurchase program. Cash Flows Fiscal 2011 Compared to Fiscal 2010 Fiscal Years Ended April 2, April 3, 2011 2010 $ Change (millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 688.7 $ 906.5 $ (217.8 ) Net cash used in investing activities (299.4 ) (504.4 ) 205.0 Net cash used in financing activities (512.6 ) (306.4 ) (206.2 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents 13.2 (13.8 ) 27.0 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (110.1 ) $ 81.9 $ (192.0 ) Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $688.7 million in Fiscal 2011, as compared to $906.5 million in Fiscal 2010. This net decrease in operating cash flow was primarily driven by: a decrease related to inventories primarily attributable to the timing of inventory receipts, as well as an increase in inventory levels to support our new business initiatives, store openings and recent acquisitions. The higher year over year inventory levels also reflect the increased sourcing costs during the second half of Fiscal 2011; a decrease related to accounts receivable primarily due to increased sales; and a decrease related to income taxes due to the timing of income tax payments. The above decreases in operating cash flow were partially offset by: an increase in net income before depreciation, amortization, stock based compensation and other non cash expenses; and an increase related to accounts payable and accrued liabilities, primarily due to the timing of payments and increased volume of shipments. Other than the items described above, the changes in operating assets and liabilities were attributable to normal operating fluctuations. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $299.4 million in Fiscal 2011, as compared to $504.4 million in Fiscal 2010. The net decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by: a decrease in cash used to purchase investments, less proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. In Fiscal 2011, we used $1.244 billion to purchase investments and received $1.242 billion of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2010, we used $1.351 billion to purchase investments and received $1.072 billion of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. The above decrease in cash used in investing activities was partially offset by: an increase in cash used in connection with capital expenditures. In Fiscal 2011, we spent $255.0 million for capital expenditures, as compared $201.3 million in Fiscal 2010. Our capital expenditures were primarily associated with global retail store expansion, construction and renovation of department store shop within shops, investments in our facilities, and enhancements to our global information technology systems; and an increase in net cash used to fund our acquisitions and ventures. In Fiscal 2011, we used $70.9 million to fund our acquisitions and ventures, including $47.0 million to fund the South Korea Licensed Operations 53 Table of Contents Acquisition and $17.0 million to fund the acquisition of certain finite lived intellectual property rights. In Fiscal 2010, we used $30.8 million primarily to fund the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $512.6 million in Fiscal 2011, as compared to $306.4 million in Fiscal 2010. The increase in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by: an increase in cash used in connection with repurchases of our Class A common stock. In Fiscal 2011, 6.0 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $577.8 million were repurchased pursuant to our common stock repurchase program and 0.2 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $16.8 million were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards issued under the 1997 Long Term Stock Incentive Plan, as amended (the 1997 Incentive Plan). On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2010, 2.9 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $215.9 million were repurchased pursuant to our common stock repurchase program and 0.3 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $15.1 million were surrendered for tax withholdings; and an increase in cash used to pay dividends. In Fiscal 2011, we used $38.5 million to pay dividends as compared to $24.7 million in Fiscal 2010, largely due to the increases in the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.05 per share to $0.10 per share in November 2009. The above increases in cash used were partially offset by: a decrease in cash used in connection with our repayment of debt in July 2009. In Fiscal 2010, we completed a cash tender offer and used $121.0 million to repurchase 90.8 million of principal amount of our 4.5% notes due October 4, 2013. There were no debt repurchases during Fiscal 2011; an increase in cash received from the exercise of employee stock options. In Fiscal 2011, we received $88.3 million from the exercise of employee stock options, as compared to $50.5 million in Fiscal 2010; and an increase in excess tax benefits from stock based compensation arrangements of $17.4 million in Fiscal 2011, as compared to the prior fiscal year. Fiscal 2010 Compared to Fiscal 2009 Fiscal Years Ended April 3, March 28, 2010 2009 $ Change (millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 906.5 $ 774.2 $ 132.3 Net cash used in investing activities (504.4 ) (458.0 ) (46.4 ) Net cash used in financing activities (306.4 ) (352.1 ) 45.7 Effect of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents (13.8 ) (34.4 ) 20.6 Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 81.9 $ (70.3 ) $ 152.2 Net Cash Provided by Operating Activities. Net cash provided by operating activities increased to $906.5 million in Fiscal 2010, compared to $774.2 million in Fiscal 2009. This net increase in operating cash flow was primarily driven by: lower accounts receivable levels due to improved cash collections and lower sales in our Wholesale segment; an increase related to inventory primarily due to the effects of ongoing inventory management across most businesses; and an increase in net income before depreciation, amortization, stock based compensation and other non cash expenses, including impairments of assets. The above increases in cash provided by operating activities were partially offset by: a decrease related to income taxes primarily due to the timing of payments. 54 Table of Contents Other than the items described above, the changes in operating assets and liabilities were attributable to normal operating fluctuations. Net Cash Used in Investing Activities. Net cash used in investing activities was $504.4 million in Fiscal 2010, as compared to $458.0 million in Fiscal 2009. The net increase in cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by: an increase in cash used to purchase investments, less proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. In Fiscal 2010, we used $1.351 billion to purchase investments and received $1.072 billion of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2009, we used $623.1 million to purchase investments, less $369.5 million of proceeds from sales and maturities of investments; an increase in cash used in connection with capital expenditures. In Fiscal 2010, we spent $201.3 million for capital expenditures, as compared to $185.0 million in Fiscal 2009. Our capital expenditures were primarily associated with global retail store expansion, construction and renovation of department store shop within shops and investments in our facilities and technological infrastructure; and a change in cash deposits restricted in connection with taxes. In Fiscal 2010, net restricted cash of $6.2 million was released, as compared to $26.9 million of restricted cash released in Fiscal 2009 primarily in connection with the partial settlement of certain international tax matters. The above increases in cash used in investing activities were partially offset by: a decrease in net cash used to fund our acquisitions and ventures. In Fiscal 2010, we used $30.8 million primarily to fund the Asia Pacific Licensed Operations Acquisition. On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2009, we used $46.3 million primarily to fund the Japanese Childrenswear and Golf Acquisition and to complete the minority interest buyout related to the acquisition of certain of our formerly licensed Japanese businesses. Net Cash Used in Financing Activities. Net cash used in financing activities was $306.4 million in Fiscal 2010, as compared to $352.1 million in Fiscal 2009. The decrease in net cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by: a decrease in cash used in connection with our repayment of debt. In Fiscal 2010, we completed a cash tender offer and used $121.0 million to repurchase 90.8 million of principal amount of our 4.5% notes due October 4, 2013. On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2009, we repaid 20.5 billion ($196.8 million as of the repayment date) of borrowings under a one year term loan agreement pursuant to an amendment and restatement to our then existing credit facility; and an increase in cash received from the exercise of employee stock options. In Fiscal 2010, we received $50.5 million from the exercise of employee stock options, as compared to $29.0 million in Fiscal 2009. The above decrease in cash used in financing activities was partially offset by: an increase in cash used in connection with repurchases of our Class A common stock. In Fiscal 2010, 2.9 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $215.9 million were repurchased pursuant to our common stock repurchase program and 0.3 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $15.1 million were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of withholding taxes in connection with the vesting of awards under the 1997 Incentive Plan. On a comparative basis, in Fiscal 2009, $169.8 million of cash was used in connection with common stock repurchases and shares surrendered for tax withholdings. Liquidity Our primary sources of liquidity are the cash flow generated from our operations, $500 million of availability under our Global Credit Facility (as defined below), available cash and cash equivalents (certain of which is considered permanently reinvested outside the U.S.), investments and other available financing options. These sources of liquidity are used to fund our ongoing cash requirements, including working capital requirements, global retail store expansion and renovation, construction and renovation of shop in shops, investment in technological infrastructure, acquisitions, joint ventures, dividends, debt repayment/repurchase, stock repurchases, contingent liabilities (including uncertain tax positions) and other corporate activities. Management believes that our existing 55 Table of Contents sources of cash will be sufficient to support our operating, capital and debt service requirements for the foreseeable future, including the ongoing development of our recently acquired businesses and our plans for further business expansion. As discussed in the Debt and Covenant Compliance section below, we had no revolving credit borrowings outstanding under our Global Credit Facility as of April 2, 2011. As discussed further below, we may elect to draw on our Global Credit Facility or other potential sources of financing for, among other things, a material acquisition, settlement of a material contingency (including uncertain tax positions) or a material adverse business development, as well as for other general corporate business purposes. We believe that our Global Credit Facility is adequately diversified with no undue concentrations in any one financial institution. In particular, as of April 2, 2011, there were nine financial institutions participating in the Global Credit Facility, with no one participant maintaining a maximum commitment percentage in excess of approximately 16%. Management has no reason at this time to believe that the participating institutions will be unable to fulfill their obligations to provide financing in accordance with the terms of the Global Credit Facility in the event of our election to draw funds in the foreseeable future. Common Stock Repurchase Program During Fiscal 2011, our Board of Directors approved an expansion of our existing stock repurchase program allowing us to repurchase up to an additional $775 million in Class A common stock, $275 million of which was approved on May 18, 2010, $250 million of which was approved on August 5, 2010, and $250 million of which was approved on February 8, 2011. Repurchases of shares of Class A common stock are subject to overall business and market conditions. In Fiscal 2011, we repurchased 6.0 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $577.8 million under our share repurchase program, including a repurchase of 1.0 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $81.0 million in connection with a secondary stock offering (as discussed in Note 18 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements). In addition, in Fiscal 2011, 0.2 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $16.8 million were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of taxes in connection with the vesting of awards issued under the 1997 Incentive Plan. The remaining availability under our common stock repurchase program was approximately $472 million and $275 million as of April 2, 2011 and April 3, 2010, respectively. In Fiscal 2010, we repurchased 2.9 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $215.9 million under our repurchase program. In addition, 0.3 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $15.1 million were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of taxes in connection with the vesting of awards issued under the 1997 Incentive Plan. In Fiscal 2009, we repurchased 1.8 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $126.2 million. Also, during the first quarter of Fiscal 2009, 0.4 million shares traded prior to the end of Fiscal 2008 were settled at a cost of $24.0 million. In addition, in Fiscal 2009, 0.3 million shares of Class A common stock at a cost of $19.6 million were surrendered or withheld in satisfaction of taxes in connection with the vesting of awards issued under the 1997 Incentive Plan. On May 24, 2011, our Board of Directors approved a further expansion of our existing common stock repurchase program that will allow us to repurchase up to an additional $500 million of Class A common stock. Dividends Since 2003, we have maintained a regular quarterly cash dividend program on our common stock. On November 4, 2009, our Board of Directors approved an increase to the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.05 per share to $0.10 per share. On February 8, 2011, our Board of Directors approved an additional increase to the quarterly cash dividend on our common stock from $0.10 per share to $0.20 per share. Dividends paid amounted to $38.5 million in Fiscal 2011, $24.7 million in Fiscal 2010, and $19.9 million in Fiscal 2009. We intend to continue to pay regular quarterly dividends on our outstanding common stock. However, any decision to declare and pay dividends in the future will be made at the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend on, among other things, our results of operations, cash requirements, financial condition and other factors that the Board of Directors may deem relevant. 56 Table of Contents Debt and Covenant Compliance Euro Debt As of April 2, 2011, we had outstanding 209.2 million principal amount of 4.5% notes due October 4, 2013 (the Euro Debt). We have the option to redeem all of the outstanding Euro Debt at any time at a redemption price equal to the principal amount plus a premium. We also have the option to redeem all of the outstanding Euro Debt at any time at par plus accrued interest in the event of certain developments involving U.S. tax law. Partial redemption of the Euro Debt is not permitted in either instance. In the event of a change of control, each holder of the Euro Debt has the option to require us to redeem the Euro Debt at its principal amount plus accrued interest. The indenture governing the Euro Debt (the Indenture) contains certain limited covenants that restrict our ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur liens or enter into a sale and leaseback transaction for any principal property. The Indenture does not contain any financial covenants. As of April 2, 2011, the carrying value of our Euro Debt was $291.9 million, compared to $282.1 million as of April 3, 2010. In July 2009, we completed a cash tender offer and used $121.0 million to repurchase 90.8 million of principal amount of our then outstanding 300 million principal amount of 4.5% notes due October 4, 2013 at a discounted purchase price of approximately 95%. A net pretax gain of $4.1 million related to this extinguishment of debt was recorded during the second quarter of Fiscal 2010 and classified as a component of interest and other income, net in our consolidated statement of operations. We used our cash on hand to fund the debt extinguishment. Revolving Credit Facilities Global Credit Facility On March 10, 2011, we entered into a new credit facility that provides for a $500 million senior unsecured revolving line of credit through March 2016 (the Global Credit Facility). The Global Credit Facility replaced our previous $450 million unsecured revolving line of credit scheduled to mature in November 2011. Key changes under the Global Credit Facility include: an increase in our ability to expand its additional borrowing availability from $600 million under the previous facility to $750 million, subject to the agreement of one or more new or existing lenders under the facility to increase their commitments; an increase in the margin over LIBOR paid on amounts drawn under the Global Credit Facility to 112.5 basis points (subject to adjustment based on our credit ratings) from 25 basis points; an increase in the commitment fee for the unutilized portion of the Global Credit Facility to 15 basis points (subject to adjustment based on our credit ratings) from 7 basis points; and an ability to denominate borrowings in currencies other than U.S. dollars, including Euros, Hong Kong Dollars, and Japanese Yen. Consistent with the previous facility, the Global Credit Facility is also used to support the issuance of letters of credit. As of April 2, 2011, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Global Credit Facility and we were contingently liable for $16.8 million of outstanding letters of credit. U.S. Dollar denominated borrowings under the Global Credit Facility bear interest, at our option, either at (a) a base rate, by reference to the greatest of: (i) the annual prime commercial lending rate of JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in effect from time to time, (ii) the weighted average overnight Federal funds rate plus 50 basis points, or (iii) the one month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus 100 basis points; or (b) LIBOR, adjusted for the Federal Reserve Boards Eurocurrency liabilities maximum reserve percentage, plus a spread of 112.5 basis points, subject to adjustment based on our credit ratings (Adjusted LIBOR). Foreign currency denominated borrowings bear interest at Adjusted LIBOR, as described above. There are no mandatory reductions in borrowing ability throughout the term of the Global Credit Facility. 57 Table of Contents In addition to paying interest on any outstanding borrowings under the Global Credit Facility, we are required to pay a commitment fee to the lenders under the Global Credit Facility in respect of the unutilized commitments. The commitment fee rate of 15 basis points under the terms of the Global Credit Facility is subject to adjustment based on our credit ratings. The Global Credit Facility contains a number of covenants that, among other things, restrict our ability, subject to specified exceptions, to incur additional debt; incur liens, sell or dispose of assets; merge with or acquire other companies; liquidate or dissolve itself; engage in businesses that are not in a related line of business; make loans, advances, or guarantees; engage in transactions with affiliates; and make investments. The Global Credit Facility also requires us to maintain a maximum ratio of Adjusted Debt to Consolidated EBITDAR (the leverage ratio) of no greater than 3.75 as of the date of measurement for the four most recent consecutive fiscal quarters. Adjusted Debt is defined generally as consolidated debt outstanding plus 8 times consolidated rent expense for the last four consecutive fiscal quarters. Consolidated EBITDAR is defined generally as consolidated net income plus (i) income tax expense, (ii) net interest expense, (iii) depreciation and amortization expense and (iv) consolidated rent expense. As of April 2, 2011, no Event of Default (as such term is defined pursuant to the Global Credit Facility) has occurred under our Global Credit Facility. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Global Credit Facility, the lenders may cease making loans, terminate the Global Credit Facility and declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable. The Global Credit Facility specifies a number of events of default (many of which are subject to applicable grace periods), including, among others, the failure to make timely principal, interest and fee payments or to satisfy the covenants, including the financial covenant described above. Additionally, the Global Credit Facility provides that an Event of Default will occur if Mr. Ralph Lauren, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, and entities controlled by the Lauren family fail to maintain a specified minimum percentage of the voting power or common stock. Chinese Credit Facility On February 10, 2011, two of our subsidiaries, Polo Ralph Lauren Trading (Shanghai) Co., LTD and Polo Ralph Lauren Commerce and Trading (Shanghai) Co., LTD, entered into an uncommitted credit facility that provides for a revolving line of credit of up to 70 million Chinese Renminbi (approximately $10 million) through February 9, 2012 (the Chinese Credit Facility). The Chinese Credit Facility will be used to fund general working capital funding needs of our operations in China. The borrowing availability under the Chinese Credit Facility is at the sole discretion of JPMorgan Chase Bank (China) Company Limited, Shanghai Branch (the Bank) and is subject to availability of the Banks funds and satisfaction of certain regulatory requirements. Borrowings under the Chinese Credit Facility are guaranteed by the Polo Ralph Lauren Corporation and bear interest at either (i) at least 90% of the short term interest rate published by the Peoples Bank of China or (ii) a rate determined by the Bank at its discretion based on prevailing market conditions. As of April 2, 2011, there were no borrowings outstanding under the Chinese Credit Facility. Contractual and Other Obligations Firm Commitments The following table summarizes certain of our aggregate contractual obligations as of April 2, 2011, and the estimated timing and effect that such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future 58 Table of Contents periods. We expect to fund the firm commitments with operating cash flow generated in the normal course of business and, if necessary, availability under our credit facilities or other potential sources of financing. Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal Fiscal 2017 and 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total (millions) Euro Debt $ $ 295.5 $ $ $ 295.5 Interest payments on Euro Debt 13.3 26.6 39.9 Capital leases 6.9 13.6 13.6 43.5 77.6 Operating leases 227.6 443.6 376.2 843.7 1,891.1 Inventory purchase commitments 991.6 991.6 Other commitments 24.1 11.2 8.9 44.2 Total $ 1,263.5 $ 790.5 $ 398.7 $ 887.2 $ 3,339.9 The following is a description of our material, firmly committed contractual obligations as of April 2, 2011: Euro Debt represents the principal amount due at maturity of our outstanding Euro Debt on a U.S. dollar equivalent basis. Amounts do not include any fair value adjustments, call premiums or interest payments (see below); Interest payments on Euro Debt represent the annual contractual interest payments due on our Euro Debt; Lease obligations represent the minimum lease rental payments under noncancelable leases for our real estate and operating equipment in various locations around the world. Approximately 59% of these lease obligations relates to our retail operations. Information has been presented separately for operating and capital leases. In addition to such amounts, we are normally required to pay taxes, insurance and occupancy costs relating to our leased real estate properties; Inventory purchase commitments represent our legally binding agreements to purchase fixed or minimum quantities of goods at determinable prices; and Other commitments primarily represent our legally binding obligations under sponsorship, licensing and other marketing and advertising agreements; information technology related service agreements; capital projects; and pension related obligations. Excluded from the above contractual obligations table is the non current liability for unrecognized tax benefits of $156.4 million as of April 2, 2011, as we cannot make a reliable estimate of the period in which the liability will be settled, if ever. The above table also excludes the following: (i) amounts included in current liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet as of April 2, 2011 as these items will be paid within one year; and (ii) non current liabilities that have no cash outflows associated with them (e.g., deferred revenue) or the cash outflows associated with them are uncertain or do not represent a purchase obligation as the term is used herein (e.g., deferred taxes and other miscellaneous items). We also have certain contractual arrangements that would require us to make payments if certain circumstances occur. See Note 17 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for a description of our contingent commitments not included in the above table. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements In addition to the commitments included in the above table, our other off balance sheet firm commitments, which include outstanding letters of credit and minimum funding commitments to investees, amounted to approximately $17 million as of April 2, 2011. We do not maintain any other off balance sheet arrangements, transactions, obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations. 59 Table of Contents MARKET RISK MANAGEMENT We are exposed to a variety of risks, including changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to certain anticipated cash flows from our international operations and possible declines in the value of reported net assets of certain of our foreign operations, as well as changes in the fair value of our fixed rate debt relating to changes in interest rates. Consequently, in the normal course of business we employ established policies and procedures, including the use of derivative financial instruments, to manage such risks. We do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative or trading purposes. As a result of the use of derivative instruments, we are exposed to the risk that counterparties to our derivative contracts will fail to meet their contractual obligations. To mitigate the counterparty credit risk, we have a policy of only entering into contracts with carefully selected financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other financial factors. Our established policies and procedures for mitigating credit risk on derivative transactions include reviewing and assessing the creditworthiness of counterparties. As a result of the above considerations, we do not believe that we are exposed to any undue concentration of counterparty risk with respect to our derivative contracts as of April 2, 2011. Foreign Currency Risk Management We manage our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates through the use of foreign currency exchange contracts. Refer to Note 16 to the audited consolidated financial statements for a summarization of the notional amounts and fair values of our foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of April 2, 2011. Forward Foreign Currency Exchange Contracts From time to time, we may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts as hedges to reduce our risk from exchange rate fluctuations on inventory purchases, intercompany royalty payments made by certain of our international operations, intercompany contributions made to fund certain marketing efforts of our international operations, interest payments made in connection with outstanding debt, and other foreign currency denominated operational cash flows. As part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, primarily to changes in the value of the Euro, the Japanese Yen, the Hong Kong Dollar, the Swiss Franc and the British Pound Sterling, we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing twelve month to two year periods. In doing so, we use foreign currency exchange contracts that generally have maturities of three months to two years to provide continuing coverage throughout the hedging period. Our foreign exchange risk management activities are governed by policies and procedures approved by our Audit Committee. Our policies and procedures provide a framework that allows for the management of currency exposures while ensuring the activities are conducted within our established guidelines. Our policies include guidelines for the organizational structure of our risk management function and for internal controls over foreign exchange risk management activities, including but not limited to authorization levels, transactional limits, and credit quality controls, as well as various measurements for monitoring compliance. We monitor foreign exchange risk using different techniques, including a periodic review of market value and sensitivity analyses. We record our foreign currency exchange contracts at fair value in our consolidated balance sheets. To the extent foreign currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges at hedge inception are highly effective in offsetting the change in the value of the hedged item, the related gains (losses) are initially deferred in equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and subsequently recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as follows: Forecasted Inventory Purchases Recognized as part of the cost of the inventory being hedged within cost of goods sold when the related inventory is sold. Intercompany Royalty Payments and Marketing Contributions Recognized within foreign currency gains (losses) in the period in which the related royalties or marketing contributions being hedged are received or paid. Interest Payments on Euro Debt Recognized within foreign currency gains (losses) in the period in which the recorded liability impacts earnings due to foreign currency exchange remeasurement. 60 Table of Contents We recognized net gains on foreign currency exchange contracts in earnings of approximately $10 million for Fiscal 2011 and $13 million for Fiscal 2010, and net losses of approximately $6 million for Fiscal 2009. Sensitivity We perform a sensitivity analysis to determine the effects that market risk exposures may have on the fair values of our derivative financial instruments. To perform the sensitivity analysis, we assess the risk of loss in fair values from the effect of hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This analysis assumes a like movement by all foreign currencies in our hedge portfolio against the U.S. dollar. Based on all foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding as of April 2, 2011, a 10% devaluation of the U.S. dollar as compared to the level of foreign currency exchange rates for currencies under contract as of April 2, 2011 would result in approximately $1 million of net unrealized losses. Conversely, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar would result in approximately $1 million of net unrealized gains. As our outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts are primarily designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions, the unrealized loss or gain as a result of a 10% devaluation or appreciation would be largely offset by changes in the underlying hedged items. Hedge of a Net Investment in Certain European Subsidiaries We designated the entire principal amount of our outstanding Euro Debt as a hedge of our net investment in certain of our European subsidiaries. The changes in fair value of a derivative instrument or changes in a non derivative financial instrument (such as debt) that is designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation are reported in the same manner as a translation adjustment, to the extent it is effective as a hedge. As such, changes in the Euro Debt resulting from changes in the Euro exchange rate have been, and continue to be, reported in equity as a component of AOCI. We recorded within other comprehensive income the translation effects of the Euro Debt to U.S. dollars, resulting in a loss of $13.1 million for Fiscal 2011, a loss of $1.8 million for Fiscal 2010, and a gain of $66.6 million for Fiscal 2009. Interest Rate Risk Management During the first quarter of Fiscal 2011, we entered into a fixed to floating interest rate swap designated as a fair value hedge to mitigate our exposure to changes in the fair value of our Euro Debt due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. The interest rate swap, which has a maturity date of October 4, 2013, has an aggregate notional value of 209.2 million and swaps the 4.5% fixed interest rate on our Euro Debt for a variable interest rate equal to the 3 month Euro Interbank Offered Rate plus 299 basis points. Our interest rate swap meets the requirements for shortcut method accounting. Accordingly, changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap are exactly offset by changes in the fair value of the Euro Debt. No ineffectiveness has been recorded during Fiscal 2011. On April 11, 2011, we terminated the interest rate swap, the effect of which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Sensitivity As of April 2, 2011, notwithstanding the aforementioned fixed to floating interest rate swap contract related to our Euro Debt, we had no variable rate debt outstanding. As of April 2, 2011, the carrying value of our Euro Debt was $291.9 million and the fair value was $305.0 million. Excluding the interest rate swap, a 25 basis point increase or decrease in the level of interest rates would, respectively, decrease or increase the fair value of the Euro Debt by approximately $2 million. Such potential increases or decreases are based on certain simplifying assumptions, including no changes in Euro currency exchange rates and an immediate across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for the remainder of the period. Investment Risk Management As of April 2, 2011, we had cash and cash equivalents on hand of $453.0 million, primarily invested in money market funds, time deposits and treasury bills with original maturities of 90 days or less. Our other significant investments included $593.9 million of short term investments, primarily in municipal bonds, time deposits and variable rate municipal securities with original maturities greater than 90 days; $51.3 million of restricted cash 61 Table of Contents placed in escrow with certain banks as collateral primarily to secure guarantees in connection with certain international tax matters; $80.8 million of investments with maturities greater than one year; $2.3 million of auction rate securities issued through a municipality and $0.5 million of other securities. We evaluate investments held in unrealized loss positions for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. Such evaluation involves a variety of considerations, including assessments of risks and uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and distinct conditions affecting specific issuers. We consider the following factors: (i) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been below cost, (ii) the financial condition, credit worthiness and near term prospects of the issuer, (iii) the length of time to maturity, (iv) future economic conditions and market forecasts, (v) our intent and ability to retain our investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for recovery of market value, and (vi) an assessment of whether it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell our investment before recovery of market value. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES An accounting policy is considered to be critical if it is important to our financial condition and results of operations and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application. Our estimates are often based on complex judgments, probabilities and assumptions that management believes to be reasonable, but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable. It is also possible that other professionals, applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances, could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts. We believe that the following list represents our critical accounting policies. For a discussion of all of our significant accounting policies, see Note 3 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements. Sales Reserves and Uncollectible Accounts A significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and net income is estimating sales reserves, which represent that portion of gross revenues not expected to be realized. In particular, wholesale revenue is reduced by estimates of returns, discounts, end of season markdowns and operational chargebacks. Retail revenue, including e commerce sales, also is reduced by estimates of returns. In determining estimates of returns, discounts, end of season markdowns and operational chargebacks, management analyzes historical trends, seasonal results, current economic and market conditions and retailer performance. We review and refine these estimates on a quarterly basis. Our historical estimates of these costs have not differed materially from actual results. Similarly, management evaluates accounts receivables to determine if they will ultimately be collected. Significant judgments and estimates are involved in this evaluation, including an analysis of specific risks on a customer by customer basis for larger accounts and customers, and a receivables aging analysis that determines the percentage of receivables that has historically been uncollected by aged category. Based on this information, management provides a reserve for the estimated amounts believed to be uncollectible. Although management believes that it has adequately provided for those risks as part of our bad debt reserve, a severe and prolonged adverse impact on our major customers business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales, cash flows and or financial condition. See Accounts Receivable in Note 3 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for an analysis of the activity in our sales reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts for each of the three fiscal years presented. Inventories We hold inventory that is sold through wholesale distribution channels to major department stores and specialty retail stores, including our own retail stores. We also hold retail inventory that is sold in our own stores and e commerce sites directly to consumers. Wholesale and retail inventories are stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value with cost primarily determined on a weighted average cost basis. We continually evaluate the composition of our inventories, assessing slow turning product and fashion product. Estimated realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical and forecasted 62 Table of Contents sales trends of our individual product lines, the impact of market trends and economic conditions, and the value of current orders in house relating to the future sales of inventory. Estimates may differ from actual results due to quantity, quality and mix of products in inventory, consumer and retailer preferences and market conditions. Our historical estimates of these costs and the provisions have not differed materially from actual results. Reserves for inventory shrinkage, representing the risk over physical loss of inventory, are estimated based on historical experience and are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts. Business Combinations In connection with our business combinations (whether partial, full or step acquisitions), we are required to record all of the assets and liabilities of the acquired business at fair value; recognize contingent consideration at fair value on the acquisition date; and, for certain arrangements, recognize changes in fair value in earnings until settlement. These fair value determinations require managements judgment and may involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including assumptions with respect to future cash inflows and outflows, discount rates, asset lives and market multiples, among other items. In addition, in connection with our business acquisitions, we evaluate the terms of any pre existing relationships to determine if a settlement of the pre existing relationship exists. These pre existing relationships primarily relate to licensing agreements. If the terms of the pre existing relationships were determined to not be reflective of market, a settlement gain or loss would be recognized in earnings, measured by the amount in which the contract is favorable or unfavorable to us when compared with pricing for current market transactions for the same or similar items. We allocate the aggregate consideration exchanged in these transactions between the value of the business acquired and the value of the settlement of any pre existing relationships in proportion to estimates of their respective fair values. Accordingly, significant judgment is required to determine the respective fair values of the business acquired and the value of the settlement of the pre existing relationship. We may utilize independent valuation firms to assist in the determination of fair value. Fair Value Measurements We use judgment in our determination of the fair value of a particular asset or liability when evaluating the inputs used in valuation as of the measurement date, notably the extent to which the inputs are market based (observable) or internally derived (unobservable). See Note 15 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our fair value measurements. The fair value of derivative assets and liabilities is determined using a pricing model, which is primarily based on market observable external inputs, including forward and spot rates for foreign currencies and considers the impact of our credit risk, if any. Changes in counterparty credit risk are also considered in the valuation of derivative financial instruments. Impairment of Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Goodwill, including any goodwill included in the carrying value of investments accounted for using the equity method of accounting, and certain other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, are not amortized. Rather, goodwill and such indefinite lived intangible assets are assessed for impairment at least annually. Finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives and, along with other long lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Goodwill impairment is determined using a two step process. The first step of the goodwill impairment test is to identify potential impairment by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its net book value (or carrying amount), including goodwill. If the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not to be impaired and performance of the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the second step of the goodwill impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. The second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of the reporting units goodwill with the carrying amount of that 63 Table of Contents goodwill. If the carrying amount of the reporting units goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination. That is, the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit (including any unrecognized intangible assets) as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit under the first step of the goodwill impairment test and determining the fair value of individual assets and liabilities of a reporting unit (including unrecognized intangible assets) under the second step of the goodwill impairment test is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. Similarly, estimates and assumptions are used in determining the fair value of other intangible assets. These estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and the magnitude of any such charge. To assist management in the process of determining goodwill impairment, we review and consider appraisals from independent valuation firms. Estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows, market comparisons and recent transactions. These approaches use significant estimates and assumptions, including projected future cash flows (including timing), discount rates reflecting the risks inherent in future cash flows, perpetual growth rates and determination of appropriate market comparables. The impairment test for other indefinite lived intangible assets consists of a comparison of the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying value. If the carrying value of the indefinite lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the excess. In addition, in evaluating finite lived intangible assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and eventual disposition. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value. We performed our annual impairment assessment of goodwill during the second quarter of Fiscal 2011. Based on the results of the impairment assessment as of July 4, 2010, we confirmed that the fair value of our reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and there were no reporting units at risk of impairment. Additionally, there have been no impairment losses recorded in connection with the assessment of the recoverability of goodwill or other intangible assets during any of the three fiscal years presented. Impairment of Other Long Lived Assets Property and equipment, along with other long lived assets, are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying amounts may not be recoverable. In evaluating long lived assets for recoverability, we use our best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. To the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value, considering external market participant assumptions. Assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell. In determining future cash flows, we take various factors into account, including changes in merchandising strategy, the emphasis on retail store cost controls, the effects of macroeconomic trends such as consumer spending, and the impacts of more experienced retail store managers and increased local advertising. Since the determination of future cash flows is an estimate of future performance, there may be future impairments in the event that future cash flows do not meet expectations. During Fiscal 2011, Fiscal 2010 and Fiscal 2009, we recorded non cash impairment charges of $2.5 million, $6.6 million, and $55.4 million, respectively, to reduce the net carrying value of certain long lived assets primarily in our Retail segment to their estimated fair value. See Note 11 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 64 Table of Contents Income Taxes In determining the income tax provision for financial reporting purposes, we establish a reserve for uncertain tax positions. If we consider that a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained upon audit, based solely on the technical merits of the position, we recognize the tax benefit. We measure the tax benefit by determining the largest amount that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon settlement, presuming that the tax position is examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. These assessments can be complex and require significant judgment, and we often obtain assistance from external advisors. To the extent that our estimates may change or the final tax outcome of these matters is different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the income tax provision in the period in which such determinations are made. If the initial assessment fails to result in the recognition of a tax benefit, we regularly monitor our position and subsequently recognize the tax benefit if (i) there are changes in tax law or analogous case law that sufficiently raise the likelihood of prevailing on the technical merits of the position to more likely than not, (ii) the statute of limitations expires, or (iii) there is a completion of an audit resulting in a settlement of that tax year with the appropriate agency. Deferred income taxes reflect the tax effect of certain net operating loss, capital loss and general business credit carryforwards and the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities for financial statement and income tax purposes, as determined under enacted tax laws and rates. Valuation allowances are established when management determines that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Tax valuation allowances are analyzed periodically by assessing the adequacy of future expected taxable income, which typically involves the significant use of estimates. Such allowances are adjusted as events occur, or circumstances change, that warrant adjustments to those balances. See Note 13 to the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements for further discussion of income taxes. Contingencies We are periodically exposed to various contingencies in the ordinary course of conducting our business, including certain litigations, alleged information system security breach matters, contractual disputes, employee relation matters, various tax audits, and trademark and intellectual property matters and disputes. We record a liability for such contingencies to the extent that we conclude their occurrence is probable and the related losses are estimable. In addition, if it is reasonably possible that an unfavorable settlement of a contingency could exceed the established liability, we disclose the estimated impact on our liquidity, financial condition and results of operations. Management considers many factors in making these assessments. As the ultimate resolution of contingencies is inherently unpredictable, these assessments can involve a series of complex judgments about future events including, but not limited to, court rulings, negotiations between affected parties and governmental actions. As a result, the accounting for loss contingencies relies heavily on estimates and assumptions. Stock Based Compensation We expense all share based payments to employees and non employee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period, adjusted for estimated forfeitures. Stock Options Stock options are granted to employees and non employee directors with exercise prices equal to fair market value at the date of grant. We use the Black Scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options granted, which requires the input of subjective assumptions. Certain key assumptions involve estimating future uncertain events. The key factors influencing the estimation process include the expected term of the option, the expected stock price volatility factor, the expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate, among others. Generally, once stock option values are determined, current accounting practices do not permit them to be changed, even if the estimates used are different from the actuals. Determining the fair value of stock based compensation at the date of grant requires significant judgment by management, including estimates of the above Black Scholes assumptions. In addition, judgment is required in 65 Table of Contents estimating the number of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited. If actual results differ significantly from these estimates, if management changes the assumptions for future stock based award grants, or if there are changes in market conditions, stock based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted. Restricted Stock and Restricted Stock Units (RSUs) We grant restricted shares of Class A common stock and service based RSUs to certain of our senior executives and non employee directors. In addition, we grant performance based RSUs to such senior executives and other key executives, and certain of our other employees. The fair values of restricted stock shares and RSUs are based on the fair value of unrestricted Class A common stock, as adjusted to reflect the absence of dividends for those restricted securities that are not entitled to dividend equivalents. Compensation expense for performance based RSUs is recognized over the related service period when attainment of the performance goals is deemed probable, which involves judgment on the part of management.
