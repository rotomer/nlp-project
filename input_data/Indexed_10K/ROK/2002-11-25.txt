Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the Companys reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management. Revenue Recognition Sales are generally recorded when all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists, product delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Management is required to make judgments about whether the pricing is fixed or determinable and whether or not collectibility is reasonably assured. The Company records accruals for sales rebates to distributors at the time of shipment based upon historical experience. The liability recorded for the Companys primary distributor rebate program was $36 million at September 30, 2002 and $35 million at September 30, 2001. In addition, the Company has a liability for rebates and sales incentives to commercial customers and other distributors of $32 million at September 30, 2002 and $28 million at September 30, 2001. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions. Additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company has anticipated or for customer specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty. During 2002, the Company recorded an allowance of approximately $9 million to fully reserve a receivable due to the deterioration in the financial condition of one of its independent distributors. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $45 million at September 30, 2002 and $43 million at September 30, 2001. Excess and Obsolete Inventory The Company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions. Additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the Company has estimated. The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $53 million at September 30, 2002 and $50 million at September 30, 2001. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The Company uses judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment test is necessary. Factors the Company considers which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used, and significant negative industry or economic trends. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value. The Company is required to make estimates of its future cash flows related to the asset subject to review. These estimates require assumptions about demand for the Companys products and 14 services, future market conditions and technological developments. Other assumptions include determining the discount rate and future growth rates. During 2002, the Company recorded pre tax impairment charges of $129 million ($108 million after tax) in connection with the adoption of SFAS 142. Additional information regarding the impairment charges is contained in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Financial Statements. Product Warranty Obligations The Company records a liability for product warranty obligations at the time of sale to a customer based upon historical warranty experience. The Company also records a liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable. Additional provision for product warranty obligations may be required if actual product performance is less favorable than anticipated. The liability for product warranty obligations was $31 million at September 30, 2002 and $34 million at September 30, 2001. Retirement Benefits Pension Benefits Pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions including discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets and assumed annual rate of compensation increase for plan employees, among other factors. Changes in discount rate and differences from actual results for each assumption will affect the amount of pension expense recognized in future periods. For fiscal 2002, based on an annual review of actuarial assumptions, the Company reduced the long term expected rate of return on plan assets from 9.75 percent to 9.0 percent and the discount rate from 8.0 percent to 7.5 percent for the pension plan covering most of its employees. All other factors being equal, these changes resulted in incremental pension expense in 2002 of approximately $12 million. For fiscal year 2003, the Company is assuming an expected rate of return on plan assets of 8.5 percent and a discount rate of 7.0 percent. All other factors being equal, and assuming actual experience is consistent with the actuarial assumptions, the Company expects fiscal year 2003 pension expense to increase by approximately $15 million compared to fiscal 2002 including the recognition of actuarial losses related primarily to the accumulated difference between actual and expected returns or pension plan assets. In addition, while not required to contribute any amount to the Companys primary qualified pension plan trust covering the majority of its employees, the Company may choose to contribute up to the maximum allowable tax deductible contribution of approximately $50 million during fiscal 2003. Additional information regarding pension benefits is available in Note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statement in the Financial Statements. Other Postretirement Benefits The costs and obligation for postretirement benefits other than pension are also actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions including the discount rate and expected future increase in per capita costs of covered postretirement health care benefits. Changes in the discount rate and differences between actual and assumed per capita health care costs may affect the recorded amount of the expense in future periods. Effective October 1, 2002, the Company amended its U.S. postretirement health care benefit program in order to mitigate the increasing cost of postretirement health care services. The effect of this change will be to reduce the benefit obligation by $62 million. Net periodic benefit cost in 2003 will be approximately $32 million, which is approximately 20 percent lower than what the cost would have been without implementing this change. Additional information regarding postretirement benefits is available in Note 12 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Financial Statements. Self Insurance Liabilities The Companys self insurance programs include primarily product liability and workers compensation. For product liability and workers compensation, the Company self insures from the first dollar of loss up to specified retention levels. Eligible losses in excess of self insurance retention levels and up to stated limits of liability are covered by policies purchased from third party insurers. The aggregate self insurance liability is 15 estimated using the Companys claim experience and risk exposure levels for the periods being valued. Adjustments to the self insured liabilities may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or jury awards. The liability for these self insurance programs was $48 million at September 30, 2002 and $46 million at September 30, 2001. Litigation, Claims and Contingencies The Company records environmental liabilities based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures utilizing information received from independent environmental consultants. The liabilities include accruals for sites owned by the Company and third party sites where the Company was determined to be a potentially responsible party. At third party sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified, the Company records a liability for its estimated allocable share of costs related to its involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. At environmental sites in which the Company is the only responsible party, a liability is recorded for the total estimated costs of remediation. Future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup. To the extent that remediation procedures change or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected, the estimate of the Companys environmental liabilities may change. The liability for environmental matters, net of related receivables was $28 million at September 30, 2002. Additional information regarding litigation, claims and contingencies is included in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Financial Statements. Income Taxes The Company records a liability for potential tax assessments based on its estimate of the potential exposure. The liability for potential tax assessments may be affected by new laws and new interpretations of laws and rulings by tax authorities, among other reasons. Due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues, actual payments or assessments may differ from estimates. To the extent the Companys estimates differ from actual payments or assessments, income tax expense is adjusted. During 2002, the Company resolved certain matters from previous years resulting in a $48 million reduction of its income tax provision. During 2001, the Company reached agreement with various taxing authorities on refund claims related to certain prior years and recorded $22 million as a reduction of its income tax provision. Additional information regarding income taxes is included in Note 17 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in the Financial Statements. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $23 million at September 30, 2002 for the majority of its deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and state tax credit carryforwards. The valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty of the amounts of net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and state tax credit carryforwards that are expected to be realized. An increase to income would result if the Company determines it could utilize more net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and state tax credit carryforwards than originally expected. At the end of each interim reporting period, the Company estimates the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. The estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned (e.g. United States compared to non United States) as well as tax planning strategies. If the actual results are different from the Companys estimates, adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made. 16 Results of Operations Summary of Results of Operations Year Ended September 30, 2002 2001(c) 2000(c) (in millions) Sales: Control Systems $ 3,060 $ 3,327 $ 3,641 Power Systems 716 748 803 FirstPoint Contact 133 150 168 Other(a) 60 49 Total $ 3,909 $ 4,285 $ 4,661 Segment operating earnings (loss)(b): Control Systems $ 324 $ 425 $ 636 Power Systems 53 39 69 FirstPoint Contact 4 7 (16 ) Other(a) 3 7 Total 381 474 696 Goodwill and purchase accounting items(d) (25 ) (79 ) (82 ) General corporate net (57 ) (53 ) (20 ) Loss on disposition of a business (14 ) Interest expense (66 ) (83 ) (73 ) Special charges (91 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes and accounting change 233 168 507 Provision for income taxes (7 ) (43 ) (163 ) Income from continuing operations before accounting change 226 125 344 Income from discontinued operations 3 180 292 Cumulative effect of accounting change(d) (108 ) Net income $ 121 $ 305 $ 636 (a) Other represents the sales and segment operating earnings of Rockwell Science Center through the third quarter of 2001. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2001, the Companys 50 percent ownership interest in RSC is accounted for using the equity method, and the Companys proportional share of RSCs earnings or losses are included in general corporate net. (b) Information with respect to the composition of segment operating earnings is contained in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Financial Statements. (c) Certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to reflect the transfer of management responsibility of a business from Control Systems to Power Systems which was effective January 1, 2002. In addition, certain amounts have been reclassified from cost of sales to sales as a result of the adoption of EITF 01 14. (d) Effective October 1, 2001, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142). As a result of adopting SFAS 142, the Company no longer amortizes goodwill and certain other intangible assets that have been deemed to have an indefinite useful life. The amortization related to goodwill and the indefinite useful life intangible assets was $56 million in 2001 and $53 million in 2000. In addition, the Company recorded a charge of $56 million ($35 million after tax, or 19 cents per diluted share) related to a trademark impairment and $73 million (before and after tax, or 39 cents per diluted share) related to goodwill impairment in connection with the adoption of SFAS 142. The amount included in goodwill and purchase accounting items in 2002 includes amortization expense for acquired intangible assets that do not have an indefinite life and depreciation expense for purchase accounting adjustments. 17 Demand for the Companys products is largely driven by trends in industrial spending. Sales are affected by the level of industrial production activity, customers new product introductions, upgrades and expansions of existing manufacturing facilities and the creation of new manufacturing facilities. Due to recent weak business conditions, especially in the manufacturing economy, manufacturers have been operating at historically low levels of plant capacity utilization. This condition results in the tendency to defer significant amounts of capital investment until the environment improves. Capacity utilization in the United States, as published by the Federal Reserve, decreased from 80.2 percent in December 2000 to 75.9 percent in September 2002. As a result, demand for the Companys products has deteriorated, the results of which are reflected in the operating results for 2002 and 2001. 2002 Compared to 2001 Sales were $3,909 million in 2002 compared to $4,285 million in 2001. Income from continuing operations before accounting change in 2002 was $226 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, compared to $125 million, or 68 cents per diluted share, in 2001. The 2002 results from continuing operations include a reduction in the income tax provision of $48 million, or 26 cents per diluted share, from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters and income of $9 million ($7 million after tax or four cents per diluted share) from the favorable settlement of intellectual property matters. In 2001, income from continuing operations before accounting change would have been $198 million, or $1.07 per diluted share, excluding amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets of $56 million ($47 million after tax, or 25 cents per diluted share), as well as special charges of $91 million ($60 million after tax, or 32 cents per diluted share) for costs associated with realignment actions and income of $18 million ($12 million after tax, or six cents per diluted share) resulting from the favorable settlement of an intellectual property matter and a reduction in the income tax provision of $22 million, or 12 cents per diluted share, from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. Control Systems Control Systems sales in 2002 were $3,060 million compared to $3,327 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily the result of continued depressed market conditions for automation products. Sales declined 9 percent in the United States in 2002 compared to 2001 while non United States shipments (which exclude the effect of foreign currency translation) declined 4 percent compared to 2001 primarily as a result of a 9 percent decline in Europe. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, non United States shipments declined 6 percent compared to 2001, including an 11 percent decrease in Europe. Despite the overall sales decline, sales of Logix integrated architecture products increased 31 percent. Sales in the Global Manufacturing Solutions business increased 6 percent over 2001 driven by increases in process and engineering solutions sales and the acquisition of Propack. Segment operating earnings were $324 million in 2002 compared to $425 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume, especially in higher margin CPAG and ACIG products. In addition, Control Systems continued to invest in the growth of its Global Manufacturing Solutions business. Control Systems return on sales in 2002 was 10.6 percent compared to 12.8 percent in 2001. Power Systems Power Systems sales in 2002 were $716 million compared to $748 million in 2001. The decline was the result of lower demand due to depressed market conditions. Segment operating earnings increased to $53 million in 2002 from $39 million in 2001. The improvement was the result of cost savings from actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2001 and ongoing initiatives to improve productivity. Power Systems return on sales was 7.4 percent in 2002 compared to 5.2 percent in 2001. FirstPoint Contact FirstPoint Contacts sales in 2002 were $133 million compared to $150 million in 2001. The decline was primarily due to decreased customer capital spending for telecommunications products. Segment operating 18 earnings were $4 million in 2002 compared to $7 million in 2001. Included in 2002 results are charges of $4 million related to severance and an asset impairment. General Corporate Net General corporate expenses were $57 million in 2002 compared to $53 million in 2001. General corporate expenses included income from the settlement of intellectual property matters of $9 million in 2002 and $18 million in 2001 and a gain on the sale of real estate of $5 million in 2001. Also in 2001, general corporate expenses included $3 million of costs associated with the spinoff of Rockwell Collins. Excluding these items, general corporate expenses decreased from $73 million in 2001 to $66 million in 2002, primarily as a result of lower corporate spending. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased to $66 million in 2002 from $83 million in 2001. The decrease was due to lower weighted average borrowings and lower commercial paper borrowing rates in 2002. The Company used commercial paper in the second quarter of 2001 to fund an acquisition by Rockwell Collins. In the third quarter of 2001, the Company received a special payment of $300 million from Rockwell Collins which was used to repay commercial paper borrowings. 2001 Compared to 2000 Sales were $4,285 million in 2001 compared to $4,661 million in 2000. Income from continuing operations in 2001 was $125 million, or 68 cents per diluted share, compared to $344 million, or $1.81 per diluted share, in 2000. The 2001 results from continuing operations included special charges of $91 million ($60 million after tax, or 32 cents per diluted share) for costs associated with realignment actions which were partially offset by an $18 million gain ($12 million after tax, or six cents per diluted share) resulting from the favorable settlement of an intellectual property matter. Control Systems Control Systems sales in 2001 were $3,327 million compared to $3,641 million in 2000, reflecting principally depressed market conditions for automation products in the United States during 2001. Non United States shipments (which exclude the effect of foreign currency translation) were higher and included increases of six percent in Europe, 13 percent in Asia Pacific and 13 percent in Latin America. Sales in 2001 were reduced by approximately $96 million due to a stronger dollar in 2001, particularly against the euro, relative to the foreign currency exchange rates in 2000. Segment operating earnings were $425 million in 2001 compared to $636 million in 2000. The decrease was due to lower volume and costs resulting from planned lower capacity utilization. Control Systems return on sales in 2001 was 12.8 percent compared to 17.5 percent in 2000. Power Systems Power Systems sales in 2001 were $748 million compared to $803 million in 2000, with an increase at the electrical business more than offset by lower volume in mechanical products as distributors continued to pare inventories. Segment operating earnings in 2001 were $39 million compared to $69 million in 2000 primarily due to lower volume and unfavorable product mix. Power Systems return on sales was 5.2 percent in 2001 compared to 8.6 percent in 2000. FirstPoint Contact Sales at FirstPoint Contact were $150 million in 2001 compared to $168 million in 2000. The decrease was due to depressed market conditions in the telecommunications sector. Segment operating earnings were $7 million in 2001 compared to an operating loss of $16 million in 2000. The increase was due to the 19 successful implementation of cost saving initiatives and the absence of approximately $10 million in charges related to such initiatives which are reflected in the results for 2000. General Corporate Net General corporate expenses in 2001 included income of $18 million resulting from the favorable settlement of an intellectual property matter, $3 million of costs associated with the spinoff of Rockwell Collins and a $5 million gain on the sale of real estate. General corporate expenses in 2000 included a $32 million gain on the sale of real estate and $28 million of income resulting from the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company demutualization. Special Charges In 2001, the Company recorded charges of $91 million ($60 million after tax, or 32 cents per diluted share) for costs associated with a realignment of its business operations to reduce costs in response to the continued decline in demand in industrial automation markets. Total cash expenditures related to the realignment actions will be approximately $50 million, of which $43 million had been spent as of September 30, 2002. The special charges are related to the business segments as follows: Control Systems, $76 million; Power Systems, $5 million; and Corporate, $10 million. See Note 13, Special Charges, in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Financial Statements. Accounting Change Effective October 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 142. This standard requires that companies no longer amortize goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets, such as trademarks. This standard also requires that companies evaluate goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment. In 2002, as a result of this analysis, the Company recorded charges of $56 million ($35 million after tax, or 19 cents per diluted share) related to a trademark impairment and $73 million (before and after tax, or 39 cents per diluted share) related to goodwill impairment at a Power Systems reporting unit. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations in 2002 relate to a net benefit of $3 million for the resolution of certain obligations related to two discontinued businesses. On June 29, 2001, the Company completed the spinoff of its Rockwell Collins avionics and communications business into an independent, separately traded, publicly held company. In connection with the spinoff, all outstanding shares of Rockwell Collins were distributed to Rockwell Automation shareowners on the basis of one Rockwell Collins share for each outstanding Rockwell Automation share. At the time of the spinoff, Rockwell Collins made a special payment to the Company of $300 million. The Company recorded a decrease to shareowners equity for the net assets of Rockwell Collins as of June 29, 2001 of approximately $1.2 billion (including $300 million of debt incurred to make the special payment to the Company). Included in 2001 income from discontinued operations was $21 million of costs related to the spinoff. Rockwell Scientific Company LLC Since June 29, 2001, the Company and Rockwell Collins each have owned 50 percent of Rockwell Scientific Company LLC (RSC) (formerly known as Rockwell Science Center). Results of Rockwell Science Center are included in continuing operations through the third quarter of 2001. Sales of Rockwell Science Center for the first nine months of 2001 were $60 million compared to $49 million for the full year in 2000. The increase was primarily due to higher sales to the United States Government. Segment operating earnings decreased to $3 million for the first nine months of 2001 compared to $7 million for the full year in 2000 due to lower royalty income. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2001, the Companys 50 percent ownership interest in RSC is accounted for using the equity method, and the Companys proportional share of RSCs earnings or losses are included in general corporate net. 20 Acquisitions In September 2002, the Companys Control Systems segment acquired the engineering services and system integration assets of SPEL, spol. s.r.o. The acquisition is expected to accelerate the establishment of the Company as a complete solution provider in Central Europe. This acquisition also strategically locates the Company in a region with future growth opportunities. In May 2002, the Companys Control Systems segment acquired the assets of the controller division of Samsung Electronics Company Limiteds Mechatronics business (the Controller Division). The Company combined its existing Korean business with the Controller Division to form a new business that operates under the name Rockwell Samsung Automation and creates technologies for the design and development of automation products. The acquisition is expected to expand the Companys existing operations in Korea, further the Companys design and product development capabilities and support future commercial and operational expansion in the Asia Pacific region. In March 2002, the Companys Control Systems segment acquired all of the stock of Propack Data GmbH (Propack), a provider of manufacturing information systems for the pharmaceutical and other regulated industries. The acquisition is expected to broaden the Companys position in the pharmaceuticals market, enhance the Companys process solutions business and enable the Company to expand its reach into the manufacturing information markets. In January 2002, the Companys Control Systems segment acquired all of the stock of Tesch GmbH, an electronic products and safety relay manufacturer, expanding the Companys machine safety product and research and development capabilities. The aggregate cash purchase price of the businesses acquired in 2002, of which the majority related to the acquisition of Propack, was approximately $71 million. Assets acquired and liabilities assumed have been recorded at fair values. The excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the acquired tangible and intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. During 2001, the Companys Control Systems segment acquired the batch software and services business of Sequencia Corporation. The total cost of the acquisition was $6 million, which was allocated to intangible assets, including developed technology and assembled workforce, and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. The acquisition expanded Control Systems portfolio of Manufacturing BusinessWare Solutions into the batch application market. During 2000, the Companys Control Systems segment acquired Entek IRD International Corporation (Entek) and acquired substantially all the assets and assumed certain liabilities of Systems Modeling Corporation (SMC). Entek is a provider of machinery condition monitoring solutions and its acquisition has increased Rockwell Automations ability to provide value added services that reduce customers downtime and maintenance costs at their manufacturing facilities. SMC is a developer of shop floor scheduling, simulation and modeling software. The acquisition of SMC complements Control Systems Manufacturing BusinessWare strategy by providing additional capabilities. The total cost of acquisitions in 2000 was $70 million, of which $61 million was allocated to intangible assets, including developed technology, and the excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to tangible and intangible assets was recorded as goodwill. Income Taxes During 2002, the Company resolved certain tax matters for the period of 1995 1999, resulting in a $48 million reduction in its income tax provision. Excluding the effect of this reduction, the effective income tax rate for 2002 was 23.7 percent. See Note 17 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the United States statutory rate to the effective income tax rate. Management believes that the effective income tax rate in 2003 will be approximately 30 percent. The Company anticipates filing in 2003 a federal research and experimentation tax credit refund claim of approximately $100 million for the years 1997 through 2001. The claim will be subject to audit by the Internal 21 Revenue Service. The ultimate potential tax benefit of this claim, if any, is not currently known and therefore no benefit has been recognized for financial reporting purposes. Outlook for 2003 Indicators of the future direction of the global manufacturing economy are mixed, though the Companys end markets have generally stabilized. While the Company does not expect further deterioration in the markets it serves, the Company is managing its cost structure tightly, and first quarter results will include expenses for targeted cost reduction actions. These actions, combined with normal quarterly revenue trends, are expected to result in first quarter earnings per share in the range of 16 to 18 cents. For the full year, the Company will deliver earnings growth of at least 15 percent (to $1.05 per share), even if the current soft business conditions persist. If business conditions improve modestly, the Company expects to achieve earnings growth of 25 percent (to $1.15 per share). Financial Condition The Companys cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized in the following tables (in millions): Year Ended September 30, 2002 2001 2000 Cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 476 $ 335 $ 645 Investing activities (175 ) 153 (228 ) Financing activities (97 ) (197 ) (677 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 9 35 Cash provided by (used for) continuing operations $ 204 $ 300 $ (225 ) The following table summarizes free cash flow for the Company. The Companys definition of free cash flow, which is an internal performance measurement, may be different from definitions used by other companies. Cash provided by operating activities $ 476 $ 335 $ 645 Capital expenditures (104 ) (157 ) (217 ) Free cash flow $ 372 $ 178 $ 428 Cash provided by operating activities was $476 million in 2002 compared to $335 million in 2001. Free cash flow in 2002 was $372 million, after a $24 million contribution made to the Companys qualified pension plan trust related to the spinoff of Rockwell Collins and $12 million in contributions to non United States pension trusts, compared to free cash flow of $178 million in 2001. The higher cash generation in 2002 was driven primarily by working capital improvements and a decrease in capital expenditures. Cash used for investing activities was $175 million in 2002 compared to cash provided by investing activities of $153 million in 2001. Investing activities in 2001 included a special payment of $300 million received from Rockwell Collins in connection with the spinoff on June 29, 2001. Capital expenditures in 2002 were $104 million compared to $157 million in 2001. Capital expenditures in 2003 are expected to be $125 to $150 million, but will ultimately depend on business conditions. In addition to internally generated cash, the Company has access to existing financing sources, including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks. The Companys debt to total capital ratio was 36.6 percent at September 30, 2002 and 36.5 percent at September 30, 2001. During 2000, the Board of Directors approved a $250 million stock repurchase program. The Company spent approximately $63 million to purchase approximately 1.7 million shares during 2001 in connection with this program, but purchased no shares in 2002. At September 30, 2002, there was approximately $104 million 22 remaining on the Companys current $250 million stock repurchase program. The Company anticipates repurchasing stock in 2003, the amount of which will ultimately depend on business conditions. Future significant uses of cash are expected to include capital expenditures, dividends to shareowners, acquisitions, repurchases of common stock in connection with the Companys stock repurchase program and may include contributions to the qualified pension plan trust. Additional information regarding pension contributions is contained in MD&A on page 15 hereof. In addition, the Companys $150 million of 6.8% notes mature in April 2003. It is expected that each of these future uses of cash will be funded by existing cash balances, cash generated by operating activities and commercial paper borrowings; although the funding may include a new issue of debt or other securities. The Company elects to utilize commercial paper markets as its principal source of short term financing. As of September 30, 2002, the Company had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. During the year ended September 30, 2002, the Company had weighted average borrowings of $68 million under its commercial paper program at interest rates ranging from 1.8 percent to 2.7 percent. As of September 30, 2002, the Company had $1 billion of unsecured committed credit facilities available to support its commercial paper borrowings. On October 29, 2002, the Company terminated these credit facilities and entered into new credit facilities with various banks for $337.5 million expiring in October 2003 and $337.5 million expiring in October 2005. Prior to October 2003, the Company expects to enter into a new credit facility similar to the credit facility expiring at that time in an amount deemed sufficient to support its operations. Pursuant to the terms of the new credit facilities, the Companys debt to capital ratio shall not exceed 60 percent. Outstanding commercial paper balances reduce the amount of available borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities. The Companys current commercial paper credit ratings are as follows: Moodys (P 2), Standard & Poors (A 1) and Fitch (F 1). Should the Companys access to the commercial paper market be adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, the Company would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the unsecured committed credit facilities to provide short term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities would likely be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings. Cash dividends to shareowners were $122 million, or $0.66 per share, in 2002 compared to $170 million, or $0.93 per share, in 2001. Prior to the spinoff of Rockwell Collins, the Company paid quarterly cash dividends, which, on an annual basis, equaled $1.02 per share. Since the spinoff of Rockwell Collins, the Company has paid quarterly cash dividends which, on an annual basis, equal $0.66 per share. Although declaration and payment of dividends by the Company are at the sole discretion of the Companys board of directors, the Company expects to pay quarterly dividends in 2003, which, on an annual basis, will equal $0.66 per share. Certain of the Companys contractual cash obligations at September 30, 2002 are summarized as follows: Payments by Period Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Short term debt $ 162 $ 162 $ $ $ $ $ Long term debt 767 1 1 2 2 2 759 Minimum operating lease payments 208 47 42 35 25 20 39 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,137 $ 210 $ 43 $ 37 $ 27 $ 22 $ 798 In connection with the sale of a Power Systems business in 2000, the Company entered into a supply agreement with the buyer of the business. The agreement requires minimum purchases by the Company of approximately $21 million per year through December 31, 2005. In the event that purchases are less than $21 million in a given year, the Company may incur penalties which are a percentage of the amount by which the actual purchases were less than the contractual minimum for the period. Based upon current estimates of 23 future purchases, management does not believe that any penalties payable under the terms of the agreement would be material to the Companys business or financial condition. At September 30, 2002, the Company guaranteed the performance of Conexant related to a $60 million lease obligation. The lease obligation is secured by the real property subject to the lease and is within a range of estimated fair values of the real property. Management expects to be released from the guarantee by December 31, 2003. At September 30, 2002, the Company was the sole guarantor of the performance of RSC under a lease agreement for one of RSCs facilities. The total future minimum payments under the lease are approximately $7 million. The lease agreement has a term which ends in 2011. Effective October 2002, the Company and Rockwell Collins each guarantees one half of the lease obligation of RSC. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The exposure to these risks is managed through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Interest Rate Risk In addition to using cash provided by normal operating activities, the Company utilizes a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on these debt obligations. The Companys short term debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings. At September 30, 2002 and 2001, the Company had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. During 2002, the weighted average commercial paper borrowings were $68 million compared to $293 million in 2001. At September 30, 2002, the carrying value of bank borrowings was $10 million compared to $9 million at September 30, 2001. The Companys results of operations are affected by changes in market interest rates on these short term obligations. If market interest rates would have averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in either 2002 or 2001, the effect on the Companys results of operations would not have been material. The fair values of these obligations approximated their carrying values at September 30, 2002 and 2001, and would not have been materially affected by changes in market interest rates. The Company had outstanding fixed rate long term debt obligations with carrying values of $919 million at September 30, 2002 and $910 million at September 30, 2001. The fair value of this debt was $976 million at September 30, 2002 and $898 million at September 30, 2001. The potential loss in fair value on such fixed rate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt. The Company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixed rate instruments and, therefore, fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on the Companys results of operations or shareowners equity. In September 2002, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract (the Swap) which effectively converted its $350 million aggregate principal amount of 6.15% notes, payable in 2008, to floating rate debt based on six month LIBOR. The floating rate was 4.21 percent at September 30, 2002. A hypothetical 10 percent change in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the swap or the Companys results of operations. Foreign Currency Risk The Company is exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The Companys objective is to minimize its exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the utilization of foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure on transactions denominated in currencies other 24 than the applicable functional currency. In addition, the Company enters into contracts to hedge certain forecasted intercompany transactions. Contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. It is the policy of the Company not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The Company does not hedge its exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to United States dollars. A 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not be significant to the Companys financial condition or results of operations. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings. For derivatives that are hedges, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivatives change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. At September 30, 2002 and 2001, the Company had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts to exchange the euro, pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc. The use of these contracts allows the Company to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be material to the financial condition, results of operations or shareowners equity of the Company. New Accounting Standards In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS 143), which requires entities to recognize the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets in the period incurred, if a reasonable estimate of the fair value can be made. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets (SFAS 144), which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale. Under SFAS 144, the presentation of discontinued operations is broadened to include a component of an entity rather than being limited to a segment of a business. Also, accrual of future operating losses of discontinued businesses will no longer be permitted. In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS 146), which addresses financial accounting and reporting associated with exit or disposal activities. Under SFAS 146, the Company will measure costs associated with an exit or disposal activity at fair value and recognize the costs in the period in which the liability is incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. The Company is required to adopt SFAS 143 and SFAS 144 at the beginning of fiscal year 2003. Management is currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 143 and SFAS 144, but believes there will be no material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations or shareowners equity at the time of adoption. The Company is required to adopt SFAS 146 for all exit and disposal activities initiated after December 31, 2002.
