Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States which require the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The Company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the Companys reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management. Revenue Recognition Sales are generally recorded when all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists, product delivery and acceptance has occurred or services have been rendered, pricing is fixed or determinable, and collection is reasonably assured. Contracts and customer purchase orders are generally used to determine the existence of an arrangement. Shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, are used to verify delivery. The Company assesses whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. The Company assesses collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit checks and analysis, as well as the customers payment history. The Company records accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at the time of sale to a customer based upon historical experience. Additional accruals may be required if actual returns, rebates and incentives differ from historical experience. The accrual for rebates and incentives to customers was $75 million at September 30, 2003 and $74 million at September 30, 2002, of which $5 million at September 30, 2003 and $6 million at September 30, 2002 was included as an offset to accounts receivable. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The Company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions. Additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances, if economic conditions are less favorable than the Company has anticipated or for customer specific circumstances, such as financial difficulty. During 2002, the Company recorded an allowance of approximately $9 million to fully reserve a receivable due to the deterioration in the financial condition of one of its independent distributors. The allowance for doubtful accounts was $28 million at September 30, 2003 and $45 million at September 30, 2002. The decrease in the allowance balance primarily relates to the writeoff of the $9 million distributor receivable and $3 million of account collections for which an allowance had previously been provided. The remainder of the decrease resulted from the Companys regular review of the allowance, considering such factors as historical experience, credit quality and age of the accounts receivable balances. Excess and Obsolete Inventory The Company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions. Additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the Company has estimated. The allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was $56 million at September 30, 2003 and $53 million at September 30, 2002. Impairment of Long Lived Assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable. The Company evaluates the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The Company 14 uses judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment test is necessary. Factors the Company considers which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used and significant negative industry or economic trends. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value. To determine fair value, the Company is required to make estimates of its future cash flows related to the asset subject to review. These estimates require assumptions about demand for the Companys products and services, future market conditions and technological developments. Other assumptions include determining the discount rate and future growth rates. During 2002, the Company recorded pre tax impairment charges of $129 million ($108 million after tax) in connection with the adoption of SFAS 142. Additional information regarding the impairment charges is contained in Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Financial Statements. Product Warranty Obligations The Company records a liability for product warranty obligations at the time of sale to a customer based upon historical warranty experience. The Company also records a liability for specific warranty matters when they become known and are reasonably estimable. An additional provision for product warranty obligations may be required if actual product performance is less favorable than anticipated. The liability for product warranty obligations was $29 million at September 30, 2003 and $31 million at September 30, 2002. Retirement Benefits Pension Benefits Pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by annually reviewed assumptions including discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets and assumed annual rate of compensation increase for plan employees, among other factors. Changes in the discount rate and differences between the assumptions made and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense recognized in future periods. Pension expense in fiscal 2003 was $42 million compared to $25 million in fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2003 pension expense was determined using the following actuarial assumptions: discount rate of 7.0 percent (compared to 7.5 percent for fiscal 2002); expected rate of return on plan assets of 8.5 percent (compared to 9.0 percent for fiscal 2002); and an assumed rate of compensation increase of 4.5 percent (compared to 4.5 percent for fiscal 2002). All other factors being equal, these changes were the primary cause of the incremental pension expense in 2003 over 2002 of approximately $17 million. For fiscal year 2004, the Company is assuming an expected rate of return on plan assets of 8.5 percent and a discount rate of 6.0 percent for determining net periodic benefit cost. All other factors being equal, and assuming actual experience is consistent with the actuarial assumptions, the Company expects fiscal year 2004 pension expense to increase by approximately $24 million compared to fiscal 2003. This increase is primarily attributable to the change in the discount rate and includes the recognition of actuarial losses related primarily to the accumulated difference between actual and expected returns on pension plan assets. In June 2003, the Company made a $50 million voluntary contribution to the Companys primary U.S. qualified pension plan trust compared to a 2002 contribution of $24 million which was related to the spinoff of Rockwell Collins. In addition, while not required to contribute any amount to the Companys primary U.S. qualified pension plan trust in fiscal 2004, the Company may choose to contribute up to the maximum allowable tax deductible contribution of approximately $200 million. The Company currently anticipates making a contribution during fiscal 2004 to the primary U.S. qualified pension plan trust in an amount that approximates the 2003 contribution. 15 Additional information regarding pension benefits, including the Companys pension obligation and minimum pension liability adjustment, is contained in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Financial Statements. Other Postretirement Benefits The costs and obligations for postretirement benefits other than pension are also actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions, including the discount rate. Changes in the discount rate may affect the recorded amount of the expense in future periods. Effective October 1, 2002, the Company amended its primary U.S. postretirement health care benefit program in order to mitigate the Companys share of the increasing cost of postretirement health care services. This change reduced the benefit obligation by $86 million. Net periodic benefit cost in 2003 was approximately $29 million compared to $28 million in 2002. Net periodic benefit cost in 2004 is expected to be $23 million, which reflects the full year effect on expense of the October 1, 2002 plan amendment. Additional information regarding postretirement benefits is contained in Note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Financial Statements. Self Insurance Liabilities The Companys self insurance programs include primarily product liability and workers compensation. For product liability and workers compensation, the Company self insures from the first dollar of loss up to specified retention levels. Eligible losses in excess of self insurance retention levels and up to stated limits of liability are covered by policies purchased from third party insurers. The aggregate self insurance liability is estimated using the Companys claims experience and risk exposure levels for the periods being valued. Adjustments to the self insured liabilities may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or jury awards. The liability for these self insurance programs was $51 million at September 30, 2003 and $48 million at September 30, 2002. Litigation, Claims and Contingencies The Company records liabilities for litigation, claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when the Company has a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation. The Company also records environmental liabilities based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures utilizing information received from independent environmental consultants. The liabilities include accruals for sites owned by the Company and third party sites where the Company was determined to be a potentially responsible party. At third party sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified, the Company records a liability for its estimated allocable share of costs related to its involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. At environmental sites in which the Company is the only responsible party, a liability is recorded for the total estimated costs of remediation. Future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations are not discounted to their present value. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup. To the extent that remediation procedures change, additional contamination is identified, or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected, the estimate of the Companys environmental liabilities may change. The liability for environmental matters, net of related receivables, was $29 million at September 30, 2003 and $28 million at September 30, 2002. This includes an adjustment made during the fourth quarter of 2003 to increase the environmental reserve by approximately $5 million due to higher estimated future costs for environmental remediation near the Russellville, Kentucky facility of the Companys former Measurement and Flow Control business. Also during the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recognized income, reflected in discontinued operations, of approximately $7 million ($4 million after tax) from a favorable determination in a legal proceeding related to the Companys former operation of the Rocky Flats facility of the Department of Energy. 16 Additional information regarding litigation, claims and contingencies is contained in Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Financial Statements. See also Item 3. Legal Proceedings, on page 6 hereof. Income Taxes The Company records a liability for potential tax assessments based on its estimate of the potential exposure. The liability for potential tax assessments may be affected by new laws and new interpretations of laws and rulings by tax authorities, among other reasons. Due to the subjectivity and complex nature of the underlying issues, actual payments or assessments may differ from estimates. To the extent the Companys estimates differ from actual payments or assessments, income tax expense is adjusted. During 2002, the Company resolved certain matters from previous years resulting in a $48 million reduction of its income tax provision. Additional information regarding income taxes is contained in Note 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Financial Statements. The Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $47 million at September 30, 2003 for the majority of its deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and state tax credit carryforwards (Carryforwards). The valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty of the amounts of the Carryforwards that are expected to be realized. An increase to income would result if the Company determines it could utilize more Carryforwards than originally expected. At the end of each interim reporting period, the Company estimates the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. The estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned (e.g., United States compared to non United States) as well as tax planning strategies. If the actual results are different from the Companys estimates, adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made. 17 Results of Operations Summary of Results of Operations Year Ended September 30, 2003 2002 2001 (in millions) Sales: Control Systems $ 3,287 $ 3,060 $ 3,327 Power Systems 705 716 748 FirstPoint Contact 112 133 150 Other(a) 60 Total $ 4,104 $ 3,909 $ 4,285 Segment operating earnings(b): Control Systems $ 398 $ 324 $ 425 Power Systems 54 53 39 FirstPoint Contact 1 4 7 Other(a) 3 Total 453 381 474 Goodwill and purchase accounting items(c) (27 ) (25 ) (79 ) General corporate net(a) (67 ) (57 ) (53 ) Loss on disposition of a business (8 ) Interest expense (52 ) (66 ) (83 ) Special charges (91 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes and accounting change 299 233 168 Provision for income taxes (17 ) (7 ) (43 ) Income from continuing operations before accounting change 282 226 125 Income from discontinued operations 4 3 180 Cumulative effect of accounting change(c) (108 ) Net income $ 286 $ 121 $ 305 (a) Other represents the sales and segment operating earnings of Rockwell Science Center through the third quarter of 2001. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2001, the Companys 50 percent ownership interest in RSC is accounted for using the equity method, and the Companys proportional share of RSCs earnings or losses are included in general corporate net. (b) Information with respect to the composition of segment operating earnings is contained in Note 20 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Financial Statements. (c) Effective October 1, 2001, the Company adopted SFAS 142. As a result of adopting SFAS 142, the Company no longer amortizes goodwill and certain trademarks that have been deemed to have an indefinite useful life, resulting in a decrease in amortization expense in 2002. The 2001 amortization of goodwill and indefinite life trademarks was $56 million. In addition, in 2002 the Company recorded pre tax charges of $56 million related to a trademark impairment and $73 million related to goodwill impairment in connection with the adoption of SFAS 142. These charges have been recorded as the cumulative effect of accounting change in the amount of $129 million ($108 million after tax, or 58 cents per diluted share). The amount included in goodwill and purchase accounting items in 2003 and 2002 includes amortization expense for acquired intangible assets that have a finite life and depreciation expense for purchase accounting adjustments. 18 Demand for the Companys products is largely driven by trends in industrial spending. Sales are affected by the level of industrial production activity, customers new product introductions, upgrades and expansions of existing manufacturing facilities and the creation of new manufacturing facilities. Due to weak business conditions in recent years, especially in the manufacturing economy, manufacturers have been operating at historically low levels of plant capacity utilization. This condition results in the tendency to defer significant amounts of capital investment until the environment improves. The table below depicts the trend since December 2000 in capacity utilization in the United States, as published by the Federal Reserve, and in manufacturing activity in the United States, as reflected by the purchasing managers index (PMI), published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM). According to the ISM, a PMI measure above 50 indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below 50 indicates that it is generally contracting. Capacity Utilization (Percent) PMI Fiscal 2003 September 2003 74.8 53.7 June 2003 74.1 49.8 March 2003 74.8 46.2 December 2002 74.9 55.2 Fiscal 2002 September 2002 76.0 50.7 June 2002 75.9 55.2 March 2002 75.3 54.7 December 2001 74.6 48.5 Fiscal 2001 September 2001 76.0 47.2 June 2001 77.2 43.5 March 2001 79.0 42.5 December 2000 81.1 44.6 2003 Compared to 2002 Sales were $4,104 million in 2003, an increase of 5 percent compared to $3,909 million in 2002. Three percentage points of the growth was due to the effect of currency translation. Segment operating earnings for 2003 were $453 million, an increase of 19 percent compared to $381 million in 2002. Income from continuing operations before accounting change in 2003 was $282 million, or $1.49 per diluted share, compared to $226 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, in 2002. Net income in 2003 was $286 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, compared to $121 million, or 64 cents per diluted share, in 2002. The 2003 results included a tax benefit of $69 million, or 37 cents per diluted share, related to the settlement of a U.S. federal research and experimentation credit refund claim. The 2002 results included a tax benefit of $48 million, or 26 cents per diluted share, from the resolution of certain tax matters for the period 1995 1999 and a charge of $129 million ($108 million after tax, or 58 cents per diluted share) related to the adoption of SFAS 142. Control Systems Control Systems sales in 2003 were $3,287 million, an increase of 7 percent compared to $3,060 million in 2002. More than 3 percentage points of the sales increase was due to the favorable impact of currency translation, primarily resulting from the relative strength of the euro to the U.S. dollar. Sales outside of the U.S. increased 18 percent (9 percent excluding currency translation) (see Supplemental Sales Information on page 27) and U.S. sales increased 1 percent. The Companys Logix and Process Solutions businesses each 19 grew approximately 30 percent over 2002. The Companys Global Manufacturing Solutions business grew approximately 5 percent over 2002. Segment operating earnings were $398 million in 2003, an increase of 23 percent compared to $324 million in 2002. The increase was due to higher volume and the continuing benefits of cost reduction actions. Control Systems return on sales in 2003 was 12.1 percent compared to 10.6 percent in 2002. Power Systems Power Systems sales in 2003 were $705 million compared to $716 million in 2002. Mechanical sales increased 3 percent while Electrical sales decreased 5 percent. Segment operating earnings were $54 million in 2003 compared to $53 million in 2002. Segment operating earnings remained relatively stable despite the decrease in sales due to savings from cost reduction efforts. Power Systems return on sales was 7.7 percent in 2003 compared to 7.4 percent in 2002. FirstPoint Contact FirstPoint Contacts sales in 2003 were $112 million compared to $133 million in 2002. The decrease was primarily due to lower customer capital spending for telecommunications products. Segment operating earnings were $1 million in 2003 compared to $4 million in 2002. Included in 2003 results is a charge of $2 million related to a workforce reduction. Included in 2002 results were charges of $4 million related to severance and an asset impairment. General Corporate Net General corporate expenses were $67 million in 2003 compared to $57 million in 2002. Expense in 2003 included a charge of $5 million due to higher estimated future costs for environmental remediation near the Russellville, Kentucky facility of the Companys former Measurement and Flow Control business. 2002 included $9 million of income related to the settlement of intellectual property matters. Excluding these amounts, corporate expenses decreased in 2003 as a result of lower corporate staff costs and an increase of approximately $2 million in earnings from the Companys investment in RSC. Loss on Disposition of a Business In the second quarter of 2003, the Company sold a majority of its ownership interest in REJ resulting in a loss of approximately $8 million ($3 million after tax, or 1 cent per diluted share). The after tax loss on the sale included a $2 million benefit resulting from the Companys ability to utilize capital loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance had been previously provided. The cash proceeds from the transaction totaled approximately $10 million. Interest Expense Interest expense was $52 million in 2003 compared to $66 million in 2002. The decrease was the result of the retirement at maturity of the $150 million principal amount of 6.80% notes in April 2003, the benefit of an interest rate swap (see Note 9 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements) and lower average short term borrowings. 2002 Compared to 2001 Sales were $3,909 million in 2002 compared to $4,285 million in 2001. Income from continuing operations before accounting change in 2002 was $226 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, compared to $125 million, or 68 cents per diluted share, in 2001. The 2002 results from continuing operations include a reduction in the income tax provision of $48 million, or 26 cents per diluted share, from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. In 2001, income from continuing operations before accounting change included amortization of goodwill and certain other intangible assets of $56 million ($47 million after tax, or 25 cents per diluted share), as well as special charges of $91 million ($60 million after tax, or 32 cents per 20 diluted share) for costs associated with realignment actions and income of $18 million ($12 million after tax, or 6 cents per diluted share) resulting from the favorable settlement of an intellectual property matter and a reduction in the income tax provision of $22 million, or 12 cents per diluted share, from the favorable resolution of certain tax matters. Goodwill and certain trademarks deemed to have an indefinite life are no longer amortized under SFAS 142. Control Systems Control Systems sales in 2002 were $3,060 million compared to $3,327 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily the result of continued depressed market conditions for automation products. Sales in the U.S declined 9 percent in 2002, while sales outside of the U.S. declined 6 percent (4 percent excluding currency translation), primarily as a result of a 7 percent decline in Europe (9 percent excluding currency translation). Despite the overall sales decline, sales of Logix integrated architecture products increased 31 percent. Sales in the Global Manufacturing Solutions business increased 6 percent over 2001 driven by increases in process and engineering solutions sales and the acquisition of Propack. Segment operating earnings were $324 million in 2002 compared to $425 million in 2001. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume, especially in higher margin CPAG and ACIG products. In addition, Control Systems continued to invest in the growth of its Global Manufacturing Solutions business. Control Systems return on sales in 2002 was 10.6 percent compared to 12.8 percent in 2001. Power Systems Power Systems sales in 2002 were $716 million compared to $748 million in 2001. The decline was the result of lower demand due to depressed market conditions. Segment operating earnings increased to $53 million in 2002 from $39 million in 2001. The improvement was the result of cost savings from actions taken in the fourth quarter of 2001 and ongoing initiatives to improve productivity. Power Systems return on sales was 7.4 percent in 2002 compared to 5.2 percent in 2001. FirstPoint Contact FirstPoint Contacts sales in 2002 were $133 million compared to $150 million in 2001. The decline was primarily due to decreased customer capital spending for telecommunications products. Segment operating earnings were $4 million in 2002 compared to $7 million in 2001. Included in the 2002 results are charges of $4 million related to severance and an asset impairment. General Corporate Net General corporate expenses were $57 million in 2002 compared to $53 million in 2001. General corporate expenses included income from the settlement of intellectual property matters of $9 million in 2002 and $18 million in 2001 and a gain on the sale of real estate of $5 million in 2001. Also in 2001, general corporate expenses included $3 million of costs associated with the spinoff of Rockwell Collins. Excluding these items, general corporate expenses decreased from $73 million in 2001 to $66 million in 2002, primarily as a result of lower corporate spending. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased to $66 million in 2002 from $83 million in 2001. The decrease was due to lower weighted average short term borrowings and lower commercial paper borrowing rates in 2002. The Company used commercial paper in the second quarter of 2001 to fund an acquisition by Rockwell Collins. In the third quarter of 2001, the Company received a special payment of $300 million from Rockwell Collins which was used to repay commercial paper borrowings. 21 Special Charges In 2001, the Company recorded charges of $91 million ($60 million after tax, or 32 cents per diluted share) for costs associated with a realignment of its operations to reduce costs in response to the continued decline in demand in industrial markets. Total cash expenditures related to the realignment actions will approximate $50 million, of which substantially all had been spent as of September 30, 2003. The special charges were related to the business segments as follows: Control Systems, $76 million; Power Systems, $5 million; and Corporate, $10 million. See Note 14 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Financial Statements. Discontinued Operations Discontinued operations in 2003 are a benefit of $7 million ($4 million after tax, or 2 cents per diluted share) from a favorable determination in a legal proceeding related to the Companys former operation of the Rocky Flats facility of the Department of Energy. Discontinued operations in 2002 related to a net benefit of $3 million for the resolution of certain obligations related to two discontinued businesses. On June 29, 2001, the Company completed the spinoff of its Rockwell Collins avionics and communications business into an independent, separately traded, publicly held company. In connection with the spinoff, all outstanding shares of common stock of Rockwell Collins were distributed to Rockwell Automation shareowners on the basis of one Rockwell Collins share for each outstanding Rockwell Automation share. At the time of the spinoff, Rockwell Collins made a special payment to the Company of $300 million. The Company recorded a decrease to shareowners equity for the net assets of Rockwell Collins as of June 29, 2001 of approximately $1.2 billion (including $300 million of debt incurred to make the special payment to the Company). Included in 2001 income from discontinued operations was $21 million of costs related to the spinoff. Rockwell Scientific Company LLC Since June 29, 2001, the Company and Rockwell Collins each have owned 50 percent of RSC. Results of Rockwell Science Center are included in continuing operations through the third quarter of 2001. Sales of Rockwell Science Center for the first nine months of 2001 were $60 million. Segment operating earnings were $3 million for the first nine months of 2001. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2001, the Companys 50 percent ownership interest in RSC is accounted for using the equity method, and the Companys proportional share of RSCs earnings or losses are included in general corporate net. Acquisitions See Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding acquisitions. Income Taxes During 2003, the Company recognized in earnings a net tax benefit of $69 million related to a U.S. federal research and experimentation credit refund claim and a tax benefit of approximately $2 million as a result of the Companys ability to utilize certain capital loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance had been previously provided. The ability to utilize the capital loss carryforwards was the result of the sale of a majority of the Companys ownership in REJ which took place in 2003. The full year effective tax rate for 2003 was approximately 6 percent, including the effect of the research and experimentation settlement (23 percent benefit) and the REJ transaction (1 percent benefit). See Note 18 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Financial Statements. Management believes that the effective income tax rate in 2004 will be approximately 30 percent, excluding the income tax expense or benefit related to discrete items, if any, that will be separately reported or reported net of their related tax effects. During 2002, the Company resolved certain tax matters for the period of 1995 1999, resulting in a $48 million reduction in its income tax provision. Including the effect of this reduction, the effective income tax rate for 2002 was 3 percent. 22 Outlook for 2004 Customer demand has strengthened since early September 2003 and management has begun to see a broad improvement across the Companys markets. Management is confident that these early signs are indicative of an emerging upward trend and is optimistic that this trend will be sustainable. Until further evidence emerges, management is planning for revenue growth in 2004 in the mid single digits and expects diluted earnings per share in 2004 in the range of $1.35 to $1.45. Financial Condition The Companys cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, are summarized in the following table (in millions): Year Ended September 30, 2003 2002 2001 Cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 436 $ 476 $ 335 Investing activities (133 ) (175 ) 153 Financing activities (335 ) (97 ) (197 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (31 ) 9 Cash (used for) provided by continuing operations $ (63 ) $ 204 $ 300 The following table summarizes free cash flow (in millions): Cash provided by operating activities $ 436 $ 476 $ 335 Capital expenditures (109 ) (104 ) (157 ) Free cash flow $ 327 $ 372 $ 178 The Companys definition of free cash flow takes into consideration capital investment required to maintain the operations of the Company and execute its strategy. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding the Companys ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. Management uses free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate the performance of the Company. The Companys definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies. Free cash flow was $327 million for the year ended September 30, 2003 compared to $372 million for the year ended September 30, 2002. The decrease in free cash flow was in part the result of a $50 million voluntary contribution made to the Companys primary U.S. qualified pension plan trust in June 2003 compared to the $24 million contribution made in 2002 related to the spinoff of Rockwell Collins. Capital expenditures in 2003 were $109 million compared to $104 million in 2002. Capital expenditures in 2004 are expected to be $125 million to $135 million, but will depend ultimately on business conditions. The Company acquired Weidmller Holding AGs North American business and Interwave Technology, Inc. during 2003 for approximately $26 million (see Note 2 in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of the businesses). During 2002, the Company acquired four businesses for approximately $71 million. The Company elects to utilize commercial paper as its principal source of short term financing. At September 30, 2003 and 2002, the Company had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. During the year ended September 30, 2003, the Company had weighted average borrowings of $27 million under its commercial paper program at interest rates ranging from 1.1 percent to 1.4 percent. During the year ended September 30, 2002, the Company had weighted average borrowings of $68 million under its commercial paper program at interest rates ranging from 1.8 percent to 2.7 percent. 23 In April 2003, the Companys $150 million principal amount of 6.80% notes were retired at maturity using a combination of cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings. The Company repurchased approximately 5.6 million shares of its common stock at a cost of approximately $128 million in 2003, which included repurchases of approximately 70,000 shares at a cost of approximately $1.6 million under a voluntary program that provided shareowners owning fewer than 100 shares of common stock the opportunity to sell all of their shares of common stock to the Company without paying a commission. At September 30, 2003, the Company had approximately $177 million remaining for stock repurchases under existing board authorizations. The Company did not repurchase any shares in 2002. The Company anticipates repurchasing stock in 2004, the amount of which will depend ultimately on business conditions and other cash requirements. Future significant uses of cash are expected to include capital expenditures, dividends to shareowners, acquisitions, repurchases of common stock in connection with the Companys stock repurchase program and may include contributions to the Companys pension plans. Additional information regarding pension contributions is contained in MD&A on page 15 hereof. It is expected that each of these future uses of cash will be funded by cash generated by operating activities and commercial paper borrowings, a new issue of debt or issuance of other securities. In addition to cash generated by operating activities, the Company has access to existing financing sources, including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks. The Companys debt to total capital ratio was 32.7 percent at September 30, 2003 and 36.6 percent at September 30, 2002. As of September 30, 2003, the Company had $675 million of unsecured committed credit facilities available to support its commercial paper borrowings, with $337.5 million expiring in October 2003 and $337.5 million expiring in October 2005. During October 2003, the Company entered into a new $337.5 million credit facility expiring in October 2004. Outstanding commercial paper balances, if any, reduce the amount of available borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities. The terms of the credit facilities contain a covenant under which the Company would be in default if the Companys debt to capital ratio were to exceed 60 percent. In addition to the $675 million credit facilities, short term unsecured credit facilities available to foreign subsidiaries amounted to $121 million at September 30, 2003. The following is a summary of the Companys credit ratings as of September 30, 2003: Short Term Long Term Credit Rating Agency Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Standard & Poors A 1 Negative* A Negative* Moodys P 2 Stable A3 Negative Fitch Ratings F1 Stable A Stable * Standard & Poors changed its outlook to Negative in April 2003 due to its concerns about the Companys exposure to unfunded postretirement benefit liabilities, including defined benefit pension and retiree medical liabilities. Should the Companys access to the commercial paper market be adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, the Company would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the unsecured committed credit facilities to provide short term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings. Cash dividends to shareowners were $122 million, or $0.66 per share, in 2003 and 2002. Prior to the spinoff of Rockwell Collins, the Company paid quarterly cash dividends, which, on an annual basis, equaled $1.02 per share. Since the spinoff of Rockwell Collins, the Company has paid quarterly cash dividends which, on an annual basis, equal $0.66 per share. Although declaration and payment of dividends by the Company are at the sole discretion of the Companys board of directors, the Company expects to pay quarterly dividends in 2004 which, on an annual basis, are expected to equal $0.66 per share. 24 Certain of the Companys contractual cash obligations at September 30, 2003 are summarized as follows: Payments by Period Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Short term debt(a) $ 9 $ 9 $ $ $ $ $ Long term debt(b) 800 350 450 Minimum operating lease payments 214 48 38 29 25 17 57 Purchase commitment(c) 47 21 21 5 Total $ 1,070 $ 78 $ 59 $ 34 $ 25 $ 367 $ 507 (a) Short term debt includes $8 million of industrial development revenue bonds which the Company expects to repay in January 2004 (prior to maturity). (b) Long term debt excludes the unamortized discount of $46 million and the $10 million fair value adjustment recorded for an interest rate swap as permitted by SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. (c) In connection with the sale of a Power Systems business in 2000, the Company entered into a supply agreement with the buyer of the business. The agreement requires minimum purchases by the Company of approximately $21 million per year through December 31, 2005. In the event that purchases are less than $21 million in a given year, the Company may incur penalties which are 25 percent of the amount by which the actual purchases were less than the contractual minimum for the period. Based upon current estimates of future purchases, management does not believe that any penalties payable under the terms of the agreement would be material to the Companys business or financial condition. For additional information on the supply agreement, see Note 19 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in the Financial Statements. At September 30, 2003, the Company guaranteed the performance of Conexant related to a $60 million lease obligation. The lease obligation is secured by the real property subject to the lease and is within a range of estimated fair values of the real property. In consideration for this guarantee, the Company receives $250,000 per quarter from Conexant through December 31, 2003. The guarantee expires in 2005. At September 30, 2003, the Company and Rockwell Collins each guarantee one half of a lease agreement for one of RSCs facilities. The total future minimum payments under the lease are approximately $6 million. The lease agreement has a term which ends in December 2011. In addition, the Company shares equally with Rockwell Collins in providing a $4 million line of credit to RSC, which bears interest at the greater of the Companys or Rockwell Collins commercial paper borrowing rate. At September 30, 2003 and 2002, there were no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The Company is exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. The exposure to these risks is managed through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Interest Rate Risk In addition to cash provided by normal operating activities, the Company utilizes a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations. The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations. The Companys short term debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings. At September 30, 2003 and 2002, the Company had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. During 2003, the weighted average commercial paper borrowings were $27 million compared to $68 million in 2002. There were no bank borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2003. At September 30, 2002, the carrying value of bank borrowings was $10 million. The Companys results of operations are affected by changes in market 25 interest rates on commercial paper borrowings. If market interest rates would have averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in either 2003 or 2002, the effect on the Companys results of operations would not have been material. The fair values of these obligations approximated their carrying values at September 30, 2002, and would not have been materially affected by changes in market interest rates. The Company had outstanding fixed rate long term debt obligations with carrying values of $773 million at September 30, 2003 and $919 million at September 30, 2002. The fair value of this debt was $844 million at September 30, 2003 and $976 million at September 30, 2002. The potential loss in fair value on such fixed rate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt. The Company currently has no plans to repurchase its outstanding fixed rate instruments other than $8 million of industrial development revenue bonds which the Company expects to repay in January 2004 (prior to maturity) and, therefore, fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on the Companys results of operations or shareowners equity. In September 2002, the Company entered into an interest rate swap contract which effectively converted its $350 million aggregate principal amount of 6.15% notes, payable in 2008, to floating rate debt based on six month LIBOR. The floating rate was 3.52 percent at September 30, 2003. A hypothetical 10 percent change in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the swap or the Companys results of operations. Foreign Currency Risk The Company is exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The Companys objective is to minimize its exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the utilization of foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage its exposure on transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency. In addition, the Company enters into contracts to hedge certain forecasted intercompany transactions. Contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. It is the policy of the Company not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. The Company does not hedge its exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to United States dollars. A 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not be significant to the Companys financial condition or results of operations. The Company records all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent for holding them. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings. For derivatives that are hedges, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The ineffective portion of a derivatives change in fair value is immediately recognized in earnings. At September 30, 2003 and 2002, the Company had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts to exchange the euro, pound sterling, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc. The use of these contracts allows the Company to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be material to the financial condition, results of operations or shareowners equity of the Company.

Management believes sales excluding currency translation provides useful information to investors since it reflects regional performance from the Companys activities without the effect of changes in currency rates, which is outside the control of management. Management uses sales excluding currency translation to monitor and evaluate the Companys regional performance.
