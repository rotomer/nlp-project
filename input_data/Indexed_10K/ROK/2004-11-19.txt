Non GAAP Measures The following discussion includes sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and free cash flow, which are non GAAP measures. See Supplemental Sales Information on page 23 hereof for a reconciliation of reported sales to sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates in addition to a discussion of why we believe this non GAAP measure is useful to investors. See Financial Condition on page 21 hereof for a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow and a discussion of why we believe this non GAAP measure is useful to investors. Overview Overall demand for our products is driven by: Levels of global industrial production; Investments in capacity, including upgrades, modifications, and expansions of existing manufacturing facilities, and the creation of new manufacturing facilities; Regional factors that include local political, social, regulatory and economic circumstances; and 14 Industry factors that include customers new product introductions, trends in the actual and forecasted demand for our customers products or services, and the regulatory and competitive environments in which our customers operate. U.S. Industrial Economic Trends In 2004, sales in the U.S. accounted for more than 60 percent of our total sales. Due to weaker business conditions in 2002 and 2003, especially in the U.S. manufacturing economy, manufacturers operated at historically low levels of plant capacity utilization. During 2004, the manufacturing economy experienced improving fundamentals and higher levels of output. In the U.S., this is reflected in various indicators that we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our markets. These indicators include: Industrial equipment spending, which is an economic statistic compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This statistic provides insight into spending trends in the broad U.S. industrial economy, which includes our primary customer base. This measure, over the longer term, has proven to have reasonable predictive value, and to be a good directional indicator of our growth trend. Capacity utilization, which is an indication of plant operating activity, is published by the Federal Reserve. Historically there has been a meaningful correlation between capacity utilization and the level of capital investment made by our customers in their manufacturing base. The purchasing managers index (PMI), as published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which is an indication of the level of manufacturing activity in the U.S. According to the ISM, a PMI measure above 50 indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below 50 indicates that it is generally contracting. The table below depicts the trend for the indicated months since December 2001 in U.S. industrial equipment spending, capacity utilization and the PMI. Industrial Equipment Capacity Spending Utilization (in billions) (percent) PMI Fiscal 2004 September 2004 $ 155.9 77.2 58.5 June 2004 145.0 77.0 61.1 March 2004 143.1 76.6 62.5 December 2003 139.5 75.8 63.4 Fiscal 2003 September 2003 140.8 74.9 54.7 June 2003 139.3 74.0 50.4 March 2003 139.7 74.8 46.6 December 2002 136.9 74.9 53.3 Fiscal 2002 September 2002 137.9 75.7 51.4 June 2002 136.9 76.2 55.7 March 2002 142.5 75.6 55.3 December 2001 136.6 75.1 47.3 Non US Regional Trends Outside the U.S., growth in demand has in part been driven by investments made in infrastructure in emerging economies, such as those found in the Asia Pacific and Latin America regions. Demand for our products in China is moderating somewhat from the rapid expansion experienced in the first half of 2004 as a result of rising local interest rates and other economic and political factors but commercial activity in Korea 15 and India has been strong. In Latin America, demand for our products has been driven by investment in the mining and oil and gas industries, resulting in increased sales in 2004. Industry Views We serve a wide range of industries including consumer products, transportation, basic materials, and oil and gas. During 2004 we benefited from growing demand in nearly all of the industries we serve. Our consumer products segment serves a broad array of customers in the food and beverage, brewing, consumer packaged goods and life sciences industries. This group is generally less cyclical than other heavy manufacturing segments. Sales to the automotive segment are affected by such factors as customer investment in new model introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies. Basic materials segments, including mining, aggregates and cement all benefit from higher commodities prices and higher global demand for basic materials that encourage significant investment in capacity and productivity in these industries. As energy prices rise, customers in the oil and gas industry increase their investment in production and transmission capacity as they did during the latter half of 2004. In addition, higher energy prices have historically caused customers across all industries to consider new investment in more energy efficient manufacturing processes and technologies. Outlook for 2005 The following is a summary of our objectives for 2005: Expand our integrated architecture platform by accelerating the penetration of the batch/hybrid market and demonstrating the value of real time information; Continue our geographic expansion and growth, particularly in emerging economies; Build additional domain expertise in the industries we serve; and Drive continued cost productivity. Our outlook for 2005 assumes that the current economic recovery will continue and that we will experience a favorable industrial environment with gradual growth during 2005. While we expect demand for our products to benefit from this trend, we also assume that our growth will vary, and may exceed or lag trend levels in any given quarter. As of the date hereof, we expect to grow revenue in 2005 by 6 to 8 percent, excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, and to raise operating margins to approximately 15 percent. As of the date hereof, we expect full year 2005 diluted earnings per share in the range of $2.15 to $2.25, and plan to generate free cash flow in excess of net income in part through disciplined capital deployment. 16 Summary of Results of Operations Year Ended September 30, 2004 2003 2002 (in millions) Sales: Control Systems $ 3,658.6 $ 3,287.4 $ 3,059.3 Power Systems 752.5 704.9 716.4 Total $ 4,411.1 $ 3,992.3 $ 3,775.7 Segment operating earnings(a): Control Systems $ 527.9 $ 397.6 $ 323.9 Power Systems 67.5 54.6 53.4 Total 595.4 452.2 377.3 Purchase accounting depreciation and amortization (27.3 ) (26.9 ) (24.6 ) General corporate net (88.3 ) (66.8 ) (57.4 ) Loss on disposition of a business (8.4 ) Interest expense (41.7 ) (52.5 ) (66.1 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes and accounting change 438.1 297.6 229.2 Provision for income taxes (84.0 ) (16.2 ) (5.5 ) Income from continuing operations before accounting change 354.1 281.4 223.7 Income from discontinued operations 60.8 5.0 5.6 Cumulative effect of accounting change(b) (107.8 ) Net income $ 414.9 $ 286.4 $ 121.5 (a) Information regarding how we define segment operating earnings is contained in Note 18 in the Financial Statements. (b) The cumulative effect of accounting change recorded in 2002 represents impairment charges recorded in connection with the adoption of SFAS 142. Additional information regarding the impairment charges is contained in Note 3 in the Financial Statements. In September 2004, we sold our FirstPoint Contact business for cash and a note convertible into a minority interest in the corporate parent of the buyer of the business resulting in a gain of $33.5 million ($32.1 million after tax, or $0.17 per diluted share). The results of operations of FirstPoint Contact and the gain on sale are included in Income from Discontinued Operations in this annual report. 2004 Compared to 2003 Increase 2004 2003 (Decrease) (in millions, except per share amounts) Sales $ 4,411.1 $ 3,992.3 $ 418.8 Income from continuing operations 354.1 281.4 72.7 Diluted earnings per share 1.85 1.48 0.37 Sales increased 10 percent compared to 2003 driven by growth at both Control Systems and Power Systems. Three percentage points of the growth was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates. Income from continuing operations in 2004 includes $46.3 million ($0.24 per diluted share) of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax matters as well as the benefit of state tax refunds. The 2003 17 result included a tax benefit of $69.4 million ($0.37 per diluted share) related to the settlement of a U.S. federal research and experimentation credit refund claim. Control Systems Increase 2004 2003 (Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) Sales $ 3,658.6 $ 3,287.4 $ 371.2 Segment operating earnings 527.9 397.6 130.3 Segment operating margin 14.4 % 12.1 % 2.3pts Control Systems sales increased 11 percent compared to 2003. Four percentage points of the sales increase was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, primarily resulting from the relative strength of the euro to the U.S. dollar. Sales outside of the U.S. increased 15 percent (6 percent excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates) and U.S. sales increased 8 percent. Control Systems experienced sales growth in all regions with exceptional strength in the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America where we continued to increase market penetration. Sales growth was primarily driven by maintenance related and smaller productivity related projects. These projects were the result of pent up demand after the period of under investment in productive assets during 2002 and 2003. In addition to these ongoing required investments, we experienced an increase in activity related to larger scale projects in the second half of fiscal year 2004. These larger projects were driven by our customers requirements for incremental productivity improvements and capacity optimization. Our Logix platform business continued its strong growth with an increase of 30 percent over 2003. Industrial components and adjustable speed drives experienced double digit growth as well. These gains were partially offset by moderate declines in drive systems and legacy control platforms. Segment operating margins increased due to higher volume, favorable product mix and productivity improvements. Volume leverage improved during the year due to our continuing productivity efforts and ongoing facility rationalization programs. Power Systems Increase 2004 2003 (Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) Sales $ 752.5 $ 704.9 $ 47.6 Segment operating earnings 67.5 54.6 12.9 Segment operating margin 9.0 % 7.7 % 1.3pts Power Systems sales increased 7 percent compared to 2003. The Mechanical and Electrical businesses contributed about equally to the growth. The sales increase was mainly the result of volume strength in the second half of 2004. Higher global demand for basic materials and subsequent higher prices for these materials encouraged significant investment in capacity optimization and productivity and drove our sales. Significant cost and productivity initiatives launched in the second quarter, financial leverage on incremental volume, and price increases more than offset rising raw material prices, resulting in the improved segment operating margin. General Corporate Net General corporate expenses were $88.3 million in 2004 compared to $66.8 million in 2003. Expense in 2004 includes charges of $16.4 million due to higher estimated costs for environmental remediation at several legacy sites, $7.0 million of contributions to our charitable corporation, and $5.0 million of costs associated with corporate staff changes. Expense in 2003 included a charge of $4.7 million due to higher estimated future costs for environmental remediation at a legacy site. 18 Loss on Disposition of a Business In the second quarter of 2003, we sold a majority of our ownership interest in Reliance Electric Limited Japan (REJ) resulting in a loss of $8.4 million ($2.5 million after tax, or $0.01 per diluted share). The cash proceeds from the transaction totaled $10.4 million. Interest Expense Interest expense was $41.7 million in 2004 compared to $52.5 million in 2003. The decrease was the result of the retirement at maturity of the $150.0 million principal amount of 6.80% notes in April 2003, the benefit of an interest rate swap (see Note 6 in the Financial Statements) and lower average short term borrowings. 2003 Compared to 2002 Increase 2003 2002 (Decrease) (in millions, except per share amounts) Sales $ 3,992.3 $ 3,775.7 $ 216.6 Income from continuing operations before accounting change 281.4 223.7 57.7 Diluted earnings per share 1.48 1.19 0.29 Sales increased 6 percent compared to 2002. Three percentage points of the growth was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates. The growth was driven by a 7 percent increase at Control Systems which more than offset a 2 percent decrease at Power Systems. Income from continuing operations before accounting change in 2003 included a tax benefit of $69.4 million, or $0.37 per diluted share, related to the settlement of a U.S. federal research and experimentation credit refund claim. The 2002 results included a tax benefit of $48.2 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, from the resolution of certain tax matters for the period 1995 through 1999. Control Systems Increase 2003 2002 (Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) Sales $ 3,287.4 $ 3,059.3 $ 228.1 Segment operating earnings 397.6 323.9 73.7 Segment operating margin 12.1 % 10.6 % 1.5pts Control Systems sales increased 7 percent compared to 2002. More than 3 percentage points of the increase was due to the favorable impact of currency translation, primarily resulting from the relative strength of the euro to the U.S. dollar. Sales outside of the U.S. increased 18 percent (9 percent excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates) and U.S. sales increased 1 percent. Our Logix platform business grew approximately 30 percent over 2002. The improvement in segment operating margin was due to higher volume and the continuing benefits of cost reduction actions. Power Systems Increase 2003 2002 (Decrease) (in millions, except percentages) Sales $ 704.9 $ 716.4 $ (11.5 ) Segment operating earnings 54.6 53.4 1.2 Segment operating margin 7.7 % 7.4 % 0.3pts 19 Power Systems sales decreased 2 percent compared to 2002. Mechanical sales increased 3 percent while Electrical sales decreased 5 percent. Segment operating earnings remained relatively stable despite the decrease in sales due to savings from cost reduction efforts. General Corporate Net General corporate expenses were $66.8 million in 2003 compared to $57.4 million in 2002. Expense in 2003 included a charge of $4.7 million due to higher estimated future costs for environmental remediation at a legacy site. The 2002 amount included $9.4 million of income related to the settlement of intellectual property matters. Excluding these amounts, corporate expenses decreased in 2003 as a result of lower corporate staff costs and an increase of approximately $1.4 million in earnings from our investment in RSC. Loss on Disposition of a Business In the second quarter of 2003, we sold a majority of our ownership interest in REJ resulting in a loss of $8.4 million ($2.5 million after tax, or $0.01 per diluted share). The cash proceeds from the transaction totaled $10.4 million. Interest Expense Interest expense was $52.5 million in 2003 compared to $66.1 million in 2002. The decrease was the result of the retirement at maturity of the $150.0 million principal amount of 6.80% notes in April 2003, the benefit of an interest rate swap (see Note 6 in the Financial Statements) and lower average short term borrowings. Discontinued Operations See Note 13 in the Financial Statements for information regarding the composition of discontinued operations. Income Taxes During 2004, we recognized tax benefits of $46.3 million in Income from Continuing Operations and $18.4 million in Income from Discontinued Operations related to the following items: $34.5 million resulting from the resolution of certain tax matters, in part related to former businesses. A majority of the benefits recognized related to non U.S. tax matters in addition to an agreement with a taxing authority related to the treatment of an investment; $4.3 million related to additional state tax benefits associated with the U.S. research and experimentation credit refund claim in 2003 (see discussion below); and $25.9 million related to a refund from the State of California for the period 1989 to 1991. Of this amount, $7.5 million is included as a reduction in the income tax provision and $18.4 million is included in Income from Discontinued Operations. Including these items, the full year effective tax rate for 2004 was approximately 19 percent. In the aggregate, these items decreased the effective tax rate by approximately 11 percent. During 2003, we recognized in earnings a net tax benefit of $69.4 million related to a U.S. federal research and experimentation credit refund claim and a tax benefit of approximately $2.6 million as a result of our ability to utilize certain capital loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance had been previously provided. The ability to utilize the capital loss carryforwards was the result of the sale of a majority of our ownership in REJ which took place in 2003. The full year effective tax rate for 2003 was approximately 5 percent, including the effect of the research and experimentation settlement (23 percent benefit) and the REJ transaction (1 percent benefit). 20 See Note 16 in the Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the United States statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate. We expect that the effective income tax rate in 2005 will be approximately 31 percent, excluding the income tax expense or benefit related to discrete items, if any, that will be separately reported or reported net of their related tax effects. Subsequent to September 30, 2004, the President signed into law both the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 and the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004. This legislation contains numerous corporate tax changes, including eliminating a tax benefit relating to U.S. product exports, a new deduction relating to U.S. manufacturing, a lower U.S. tax rate on non U.S. dividends and an extension of the research and experimentation credit. This new legislation is not anticipated to materially affect our results of operations or our financial condition. Financial Condition The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (in millions): Year Ended September 30, 2004 2003 2002 Cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 596.9 $ 419.9 $ 461.9 Investing activities (65.2 ) (131.4 ) (171.0 ) Financing activities (312.0 ) (335.3 ) (97.4 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 1.8 (31.0 ) (0.4 ) Cash provided by (used for) continuing operations $ 221.5 $ (77.8 ) $ 193.1 The following table summarizes free cash flow (in millions): Cash provided by operating activities $ 596.9 $ 419.9 $ 461.9 Capital expenditures (98.0 ) (107.6 ) (99.6 ) Free cash flow $ 498.9 $ 312.3 $ 362.3 Our definition of free cash flow takes into consideration capital investment required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies. Free cash flow was $498.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2004 compared to $312.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2003. The following factors contributed to the significant increase in free cash flow: Income before income taxes in 2004 was $140.5 million higher than in 2003; U.S. federal tax payments were lower in 2004 as a result of the tax benefits related to voluntary pension contributions and increased benefits from the exercise of stock options. U.S. federal tax payments were $10.0 million in 2004 compared to $43.0 million in 2003; and We received net tax refunds of $30.6 million from various tax authorities related to prior years. These factors more than offset the higher voluntary contributions to our U.S. qualified pension trust which totaled $125.0 million in 2004 compared to $50.0 million in 2003. 21 We anticipate that cash payments for income taxes will approach our income tax expense in the near future. When necessary, we utilize commercial paper as our principal source of short term financing. At September 30, 2004 and 2003, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. During 2004 and 2003, we did not have significant commercial paper borrowings due to our cash position. In January 2004, we repaid our $8.4 million of industrial development revenue bonds prior to maturity using cash on hand. In April 2003, we repaid our $150.0 million principal amount of 6.80% notes at maturity using a combination of cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings. We repurchased approximately 7.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $258.4 million in 2004. At September 30, 2004, we had approximately $168.5 million remaining for stock repurchases under existing board authorizations. We repurchased approximately 5.6 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $128.4 million in 2003. We anticipate repurchasing stock in 2005, the amount of which will depend ultimately on business conditions, stock price and other cash requirements. Future significant uses of cash are expected to include capital expenditures, dividends to shareowners, acquisitions of businesses and repurchases of common stock and may include contributions to our pension plans. We expect capital expenditures in 2005 to be about $120 million. Additional information regarding pension contributions is contained in MD&A on page 14 hereof. We expect that each of these future uses of cash will be funded by existing cash balances, cash generated by operating activities, commercial paper borrowings, a new issue of debt or issuance of other securities. In addition to cash generated by operating activities, we have access to existing financing sources, including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks. Our debt to total capital ratio was 28.9 percent at September 30, 2004 and 32.7 percent at September 30, 2003. As of September 30, 2004, we had $675.0 million of unsecured committed credit facilities, with $337.5 million expiring in October 2004 and $337.5 million expiring in October 2005. These facilities were available for general corporate purposes, including support for our commercial paper borrowings. On October 26, 2004, we entered into a new five year $600.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. It replaced both the facility expiring on that date and the facility expiring in October 2005 (which we cancelled on that date). Borrowings under our new credit facility bear interest based on short term money market rates in effect during the period such borrowings are outstanding. The terms of our credit facility contain a covenant under which we would be in default if our debt to capital ratio were to exceed 60 percent. In addition to our $600.0 million credit facility, short term unsecured credit facilities available to foreign subsidiaries amounted to $130.4 million at September 30, 2004. The following is a summary of our credit ratings as of September 30, 2004: Short Term Long Term Credit Rating Agency Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Standard & Poors A 1 Negative A Negative Moodys P 2 Stable A3 Negative Fitch Ratings F1 Stable A Stable Among other things, our credit facility is a standby liquidity facility that can be drawn, if needed, to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures. This access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the ratings set forth in the table above that have been given to our commercial paper. While we are not required to do so, under our current policy with respect to these ratings, we expect to limit our other borrowings under the credit facility, if any, to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures. Should our access to the commercial paper market be adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the unsecured 22 committed credit facilities to provide short term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings. Cash dividends to shareowners were $122.5 million ($0.66 per share) in 2004 and $122.4 million ($0.66 per share) in 2003. Although declaration and payment of dividends are at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, we expect to pay quarterly dividends in 2005 at least equal to the quarterly per share amount paid in 2004. Certain of our contractual cash obligations at September 30, 2004 are summarized as follows: Payments by Period Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Long term debt and interest(a) $ 2,241.4 $ 48.7 $ 48.7 $ 48.7 $ 387.9 $ 27.1 $ 1,680.3 Minimum operating lease payments 210.9 51.0 41.8 33.6 26.9 19.1 38.5 Purchase commitment(b) 26.3 21.0 5.3 Total $ 2,478.6 $ 120.7 $ 95.8 $ 82.3 $ 414.8 $ 46.2 $ 1,718.8 (a) The amounts for long term debt assume that the respective debt instruments will be outstanding until their scheduled maturity dates. The amounts include interest, but exclude the amounts to be received under an interest rate swap, the unamortized discount of $46.0 million, and the $3.7 million fair value adjustment recorded for the interest rate swap as permitted by SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. See Note 6 in the Financial Statements for additional information regarding our long term debt. (b) In connection with the sale of a Power Systems business in 2000, we entered into a supply agreement with the buyer of the business. The agreement requires us to purchase a minimum of $21.0 million per year through December 31, 2005. In the event that purchases are less than $21.0 million in a given year, we may incur penalties which are 25 percent of the amount by which the actual purchases were less than the contractual minimum for the period. Based upon current estimates of future purchases, we do not believe that any penalties payable under the terms of the agreement would be material to our business or financial condition. For additional information on the supply agreement, see Note 17 in the Financial Statements. We sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans for certain employees. See Note 12 in the Financial Statements for information regarding these plans and expected future cash outflows related to the plans. At September 30, 2004, we guaranteed the performance of Conexant related to a lease obligation of approximately $60.0 million. The lease obligation is secured by the real property subject to the lease and is within a range of estimated fair values of the real property. In consideration for this guarantee, we received $250,000 per quarter from Conexant through December 31, 2003 and receive $500,000 per quarter from Conexant through December 31, 2004 unless we are released from the guarantee prior thereto. We expect to be released from the guarantee in 2005. At September 30, 2004, we and Rockwell Collins each guarantee one half of a lease agreement for one of Rockwell Scientific Company LLCs (RSC) facilities. The total future minimum payments under the lease are $5.5 million. The lease agreement has a term that ends in December 2011. In addition, we share equally with Rockwell Collins in providing a $4.0 million line of credit to RSC, which bears interest at the greater of our or Rockwell Collins commercial paper borrowing rate. At September 30, 2004 and 2003, there were no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit. During October 2004, the line of credit was increased to $6.0 million, with us and Rockwell Collins still sharing equally. Supplemental Sales Information We translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States using exchange rates effective during the respective period. Therefore, reported sales are affected by changes in currency rates, which are outside of our control. We believe that sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which 23 is a non GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates. We use sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates to monitor and evaluate our regional performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective periods sales using the same currency exchange rates as were in effect in the preceding year. The following is a reconciliation of our reported sales to sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates (in millions): Year Ended September 30, 2004 Year Ended September 30, 2003 Sales Sales Excluding Excluding the Effect the Effect of Changes of Changes in Currency in Currency Currency Exchange Currency Exchange Sales Translation Rates Sales Translation Rates US $ 2,727.0 $ $ 2,727.0 $ 2,530.2 $ $ 2,530.2 Canada 339.8 (30.9 ) 308.9 303.8 (22.3 ) 281.5 Europe, Middle East, Africa 779.6 (83.1 ) 696.5 685.4 (101.3 ) 584.1 Asia Pacific 400.4 (21.0 ) 379.4 330.7 (17.4 ) 313.3 Latin America 164.3 2.5 166.8 142.2 35.0 177.2 Total Company Sales $ 4,411.1 $ (132.5 ) $ 4,278.6 $ 3,992.3 $ (106.0 ) $ 3,886.3 The following is a reconciliation of reported sales of our Control Systems segment to sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates (in millions): Year Ended September 30, 2004 Year Ended September 30, 2003 Sales Sales Excluding Excluding the Effect the Effect of Changes of Changes in Currency in Currency Currency Exchange Currency Exchange Sales Translation Rates Sales Translation Rates US $ 2,054.2 $ $ 2,054.2 $ 1,893.8 $ $ 1,893.8 Canada 302.4 (27.4 ) 275.0 267.8 (19.8 ) 248.0 Europe, Middle East, Africa 766.0 (81.6 ) 684.4 668.7 (98.8 ) 569.9 Asia Pacific 382.9 (21.0 ) 361.9 326.1 (17.4 ) 308.7 Latin America 153.1 1.7 154.8 131.0 33.7 164.7 Total Control Systems Sales $ 3,658.6 $ (128.3 ) $ 3,530.3 $ 3,287.4 $ (102.3 ) $ 3,185.1 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe the following are the critical accounting policies that could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management. Revenue Recognition Sales are generally recorded when all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists; product has been delivered according to contract terms and acceptance as may be required by contract terms has occurred or services have been rendered; pricing is fixed or determinable; and collection is reasonably assured. 24 We generally use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an arrangement. We use shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based primarily on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis, as well as the customers payment history. We record accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based upon historical experience. Adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns, rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual. A critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed. If the time period were to change by 10 percent, the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately $4.0 million. The accrual for rebates and incentives to customers was $79.1 million at September 30, 2004 and $70.8 million at September 30, 2003, of which $7.8 million at September 30, 2004 and $5.4 million at September 30, 2003 was included as an offset to accounts receivable. Impairment of Long Lived Assets We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable through future cash flows. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. We use judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment test is necessary. Factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used and significant negative industry or economic trends. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value. To determine fair value, we are required to make estimates of the future cash flows related to the asset being reviewed. These estimates require assumptions about demand for our products and services, future market conditions and technological developments. Other assumptions include the discount rate and future growth rates. During 2002, we recorded pre tax impairment charges of $128.7 million ($107.8 million after tax) in connection with the adoption of SFAS 142. We perform our annual impairment test on non amortized intangible assets during the second quarter of our fiscal year. As of the second quarter of fiscal 2004, the $72.8 million net book value of our Reliance trademark approximated its estimated fair value, as computed with the assistance of independent valuation specialists. Either an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in planned future growth or profitability rates could result in a material impairment charge to writedown the book value of the Reliance trademark to the revised estimated fair value. Additional information regarding the impairment charges is contained in Note 3 in the Financial Statements. Retirement Benefits Pension Benefits Pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by annually reviewing assumptions including discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets and assumed annual rate of compensation increase for plan employees, among other factors. Changes in the discount rate and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense recognized in future periods. Our worldwide pension expense in 2004 was $68.8 million compared to $41.6 million in 2003. Approximately 80 percent of this cost relates to our U.S. qualified pension plan. We used the following 25 actuarial assumptions to determine our 2004 U.S. pension expense: discount rate of 6.0 percent (compared to 7.0 percent for 2003); expected rate of return on plan assets of 8.5 percent (compared to 8.5 percent for 2003); and an assumed rate of compensation increase of 4.5 percent (compared to 4.5 percent for 2003). The decrease in discount rate, as well as the amortization of actuarial losses, were the primary causes of the $27.2 million increase in pension expense in 2004 over 2003. For 2005, we are assuming that the expected rate of return on plan assets and rate of compensation increase will remain consistent with the 2004 assumptions, but that the discount rate will increase from 6.0% to 6.25%. Assuming this discount rate increase and that actual experience is consistent with the actuarial assumptions, we expect 2005 pension expense to remain approximately the same as 2004. The following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the assumptions for our U.S. pension plans (in millions): Pension Benefits Change in Change in Projected Benefit Net Periodic Obligation Benefit Cost Discount Rate $ 62.7 $ 6.7 Rate of Return 3.0 In 2004, we made voluntary contributions of $125.0 million to our primary U.S. qualified pension plan trust compared to a $50.0 million voluntary contribution in 2003. We currently anticipate making contributions during 2005 to our qualified pension plans in an amount that approximates the 2005 net periodic pension cost. Additional information regarding pension benefits, including our pension obligation and minimum pension liability adjustment, is contained in Note 12 in the Financial Statements. Other Postretirement Benefits We estimate, with the assistance of independent actuarial consultants, the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits other than pensions using assumptions, including the discount rate and, for plans other than our primary U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit program, expected trends in the cost for healthcare services. Changes in these assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods. Effective October 1, 2002, we amended our primary U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit program in order to mitigate our share of the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare services. As a result of this amendment, there will be no increase in healthcare costs resulting from healthcare inflationary trends beginning January 1, 2005. This amendment reduced our other postretirement benefit obligation by $86.5 million. Net periodic benefit cost in 2004 was approximately $23.4 million compared to $29.1 million in 2003. This decrease is primarily due to the effect of amending our primary U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit program. We expect net periodic benefit cost in 2005 of approximately $25 million. The expected increase is due to the amortization of actuarial losses offset by an increase in the discount rate (as of our June 30, 2004 measurement date) by 25 basis points to 6.25%. Additional information regarding postretirement benefits is contained in Note 12 in the Financial Statements. Self Insurance Liabilities Our principal self insurance programs include product liability and workers compensation where we self insure up to a specified dollar amount. Claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies purchased from commercial insurers. We estimate the liability for the majority of the self insured 26 claims with the assistance of an independent actuarial consultant using our claims experience for the periods being valued. Adjustments to the self insured liabilities may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or outcome of liability claims. The liability for these self insurance programs was $53.4 million at September 30, 2004 and $51.1 million at September 30, 2003. As described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago. See Item 3 on page 6 hereof, for further discussion. Litigation, Claims and Contingencies We record liabilities for litigation, claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation. We also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures utilizing information received from independent environmental consultants. The liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own and third party sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party. At third party sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. At environmental sites where we are the only responsible party, we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation. We do not discount future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their present value. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup. To the extent that remediation procedures change, additional contamination is identified, or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected, the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change. The liability for environmental matters, net of related receivables, was $38.8 million at September 30, 2004 and $28.9 million at September 30, 2003. During 2004, we recorded adjustments totaling $16.9 million to increase the environmental reserves related to several legacy sites. These adjustments were in addition to an adjustment made during the fourth quarter of 2003 to increase the environmental reserve by $4.7 million due to higher estimated future costs for environmental remediation at our legacy sites. Our recorded liability for environmental matters almost entirely relates to businesses formerly owned by us (legacy businesses) but for which we retained the responsibility to remediate. The nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a material charge to earnings is low. As a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters, we expect that gradually over a long period of time, our environmental obligations will decline. However, changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations. In 2004, we recorded income of $7.6 million ($4.6 million after tax) as a result of a final judgment in a defense claim legal proceeding related to our former operation of the Rocky Flats facility of the Department of Energy. This amount is in addition to income of $7.3 million ($4.4 million after tax) recognized in 2003 related to the Rocky Flats defense claim legal proceeding. In March 2004, we received $15.1 million related to this matter. This amount is displayed, net of the related tax, in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows as Cash Provided by Discontinued Operations. Additional information regarding litigation, claims and contingencies is contained in Note 17 in the Financial Statements. See also Item 3. Legal Proceedings, on page 6 hereof. Income Taxes We record a liability for probable income tax assessments based on our estimate of the potential exposure. To the extent our estimates differ from actual payments or assessments, income tax expense is adjusted. 27 Our income tax positions are based on diligent research of the applicable income tax laws, claimed with knowledge, and vigorously defended. We conduct business in many countries, which requires an interpretation of the income tax laws and rulings in each of those taxing jurisdictions. Due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction in which we do business, differences and the interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the subjectivity of factual interpretations, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. During 2004, we resolved certain tax matters, resulting in our recognizing $34.5 million of tax benefits. The majority of these matters related to non U.S. jurisdictions. During 2002, we resolved certain matters from previous years resulting in a $48.2 million reduction of our income tax provision. While our tax positions are claimed with knowledge, taxing authorities are increasingly asserting interpretations of laws and facts in an effort to increase their tax revenue especially in instances where transactions involve two or more countries. Such cross border transactions between our affiliates involving the transfer price for products, services, and or intellectual property is one of the primary issues we face. Due to our presence in Canadian markets, Canadian transfer pricing matters are the most significant of all countries in which we do business. Transfer pricing matters as well as legal structures relating to current and previously divested businesses represent nearly $57 million of our tax liabilities for income tax assessments. We have recorded a valuation allowance of $63.0 million at September 30, 2004 for the majority of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and state tax credit carryforwards (Carryforwards). The valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty of the amounts of the Carryforwards that are expected to be realized. An increase to income would result if we determine we will be able to utilize more Carryforwards than currently expected. At the end of each interim reporting period, we estimate the effective tax rate expected to be applicable for the full fiscal year. The estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned (e.g., United States compared to non United States) as well as tax planning strategies. If the actual results are different from our estimates, adjustments to the effective tax rate may be required in the period such determination is made. Additional information regarding income taxes is contained in Note 16 in the Financial Statements. Recently Adopted Accounting Standards See Note 1 in the Financial Statements regarding recently adopted accounting standards. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. We are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Interest Rate Risk In addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities, we utilize a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations. We are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations. Our short term debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings. At September 30, 2004 and 2003, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. During 2004, the weighted average commercial paper borrowings were $1.8 million compared to $26.5 million in 2003. There were no bank borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2004 and 2003. Our results of operations are affected by changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings. If market interest rates would have averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in either 2004 or 2003, the effect on our results of operations would not have been material. 28 We had outstanding fixed rate long term debt obligations with carrying values of $757.7 million at September 30, 2004 and $772.4 million at September 30, 2003. The fair value of this debt was $837.1 million at September 30, 2004 and $843.4 million at September 30, 2003. The potential reduction in fair value on such fixed rate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt. We currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed rate instruments and, therefore, fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners equity. In September 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap contract that effectively converted our $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.15% notes, payable in 2008, to floating rate debt based on six month LIBOR. The floating rate was 4.27 percent at September 30, 2004. A hypothetical 10 percent change in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the swap or our results of operations. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and the utilization of foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage our exposure on transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency. In addition, we enter into contracts to hedge certain forecasted intercompany transactions. Contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. It is our policy not to enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. We do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to United States dollars. A 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings. For derivatives that are hedges, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We recognize the ineffective portion of a derivatives change in fair value in earnings immediately. At September 30, 2004 and 2003, we had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts to exchange the euro, pound sterling, Swiss franc, Australian dollar and Canadian dollar. The use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be material to our financial condition, results of operations or shareowners equity. 29
