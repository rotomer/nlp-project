Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Non GAAP Measures The following discussion includes sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and free cash flow, which are non GAAP measures. See Supplemental Sales Information for a reconciliation of reported sales to sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates in addition to a discussion of why we believe this non GAAP measure is useful to investors. See Financial Condition for a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow and a discussion of why we believe this non GAAP measure is useful to investors. Overview Overall demand for our products is driven by: Investments in capacity, including upgrades, modifications, and expansions of existing manufacturing facilities, and the creation of new manufacturing facilities; Industry factors that include our customers new product introductions, trends in the actual and forecasted demand for our customers products or services, and the regulatory and competitive environments in which our customers operate; Levels of global industrial production; and Regional factors that include local political, social, regulatory and economic circumstances. U.S. Industrial Economic Trends In 2005, sales in the U.S. accounted for more than 60 percent of our total sales. The trend of improving conditions experienced in the U.S. manufacturing economy during 2004 continued into 2005, as reflected in the various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served markets. These indicators include: Industrial equipment spending, which is an economic statistic compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This statistic provides insight into spending trends in the broad U.S. industrial economy, which includes our primary customer base. This measure, over the longer term, has proven to have reasonable predictive value, and to be a good directional indicator of our growth trend. Capacity utilization, which is an indication of plant operating activity published by the Federal Reserve. Historically there has been a meaningful correlation between capacity utilization and the level of capital investment made by our customers in their manufacturing base. The purchasing managers index (PMI), published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which is an indication of the level of manufacturing activity in the U.S. According to the ISM, a PMI measure above 50 indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below 50 indicates that it is generally contracting. 18 Table of Contents The table below depicts the continued gradual improvement in U.S. industrial equipment spending (expressed in billions of USD), capacity utilization (expressed as a percentage), and the continued expansion in manufacturing activity, as indicated by the PMI (expressed as defined above) since December 2002.

Non U.S. Regional Trends Outside the U.S., demand is principally driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region and by our customers ability and propensity to invest in their manufacturing assets. These customers may include both multinational companies with expanding global presence and growing indigenous companies. Recent strength in demand has, in part, been driven by investment in infrastructure in developing economies, in basic materials production capacity in response to higher end product pricing and in expanding consumer markets. The table below presents our actual sales for the year ended September 30, 2005 by geographic region and the change in sales from the year ended September 30, 2004 (in millions, except percentages): Change Excluding the Effect of Changes Change vs. in Currency Exchange Year Ended Year Ended Rates vs. Year Ended September 30, 2005 September 30, 2004 September 30, 2004(1) United States and Canada $ 3,477.2 13% 12% Europe, Middle East and Africa 823.5 6% 1% Asia Pacific 483.1 21% 16% Latin America 219.4 34% 27% Total sales $ 5,003.2 13% 11% (1) See Supplemental Sales Information for information on this non GAAP measure. Industry Views We serve customers in a wide range of industries including consumer products, transportation, basic materials, and oil and gas. During 2005 we benefited from growing demand in most of the industries we serve. 19 Table of Contents Our consumer products customers are engaged in the food and beverage, brewing, consumer packaged goods and life sciences industries. As automation is key to their ability to differentiate their product offerings, their investment is generally less cyclical than heavy manufacturing customers. Factors such as customer investment in new model introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies affect our sales to transportation customers. Our customers in basic materials industries, including mining, aggregates, metals, forest products and cement, all benefit from higher commodities prices and higher global demand for basic materials, both of which encourage investment in capacity and productivity in these industries. As energy prices rise, customers in the oil and gas industry increase their investment in production and transmission capacity. In addition, higher energy prices have historically caused customers across all industries to consider new investment in more energy efficient manufacturing processes and technologies, such as intelligent motor controls. Outlook for 2006 The following is a summary of our objectives for 2006: Sustain the growth of our Logix platform by accelerating the proliferation and adoption of our integrated architecture features and functionality, and by aggressively pursuing growth in an expanded addressable market; Continue our geographic expansion and growth, particularly in emerging economies; Demonstrate and expand our industry specific domain expertise and solutions capability; and Drive continued cost productivity. Our outlook for 2006 assumes that the economic environment will remain favorable and that a continuing industrial recovery will result in growth during 2006. While we expect demand for our products to benefit from this trend, we also assume that our growth will vary, and may exceed or lag trend levels in any given quarter. As of the date of filing this report, based upon current economic activities and business trends, we expect to grow revenue in 2006 by 7 to 9 percent, excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates. As of the date hereof, we also expect full year 2006 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.00 to $3.10, and plan to generate free cash flow of approximately $280 million, after giving effect to our $450 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. qualified pension trust in October 2005. 20 Table of Contents Summary of Results of Operations Year Ended September 30, 2005 2004 2003 (in millions) Sales: Control Systems $ 4,123.6 $ 3,658.6 $ 3,287.4 Power Systems 879.6 752.5 704.9 Total $ 5,003.2 $ 4,411.1 $ 3,992.3 Segment operating earnings(a): Control Systems $ 756.9 $ 527.9 $ 397.6 Power Systems 110.3 67.5 54.6 Total 867.2 595.4 452.2 Purchase accounting depreciation and amortization (14.7 ) (27.3 ) (26.9 ) General corporate net (69.7 ) (88.3 ) (66.8 ) Loss on disposition of a business (8.4 ) Interest expense (45.8 ) (41.7 ) (52.5 ) Income from continuing operations before income taxes 737.0 438.1 297.6 Provision for income taxes (218.6 ) (84.0 ) (16.2 ) Income from continuing operations 518.4 354.1 281.4 Income from discontinued operations(b) 21.6 60.8 5.0 Net income $ 540.0 $ 414.9 $ 286.4 (a) Information regarding how we define segment operating earnings is included in Note 18 in the Financial Statements. (b) In September 2004, we sold our FirstPoint Contact business for cash and a note convertible into a minority interest in the corporate parent of the buyer of the business resulting in a gain of $33.5 million ($32.1 million after tax, or $0.17 per diluted share). In September 2005, the note was converted to non voting equity shares accounted for under the cost method. The results of operations of FirstPoint Contact and the gain on sale are included in Income from discontinued operations. Additional information related to Income from discontinued operations is included in Note 13 in the Financial Statements. 2005 Compared to 2004 (in millions, except per share amounts) 2005 2004 Increase Sales $ 5,003.2 $ 4,411.1 $ 592.1 Income from continuing operations 518.4 354.1 164.3 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 2.77 1.85 0.92 Sales increased 13 percent compared to 2004 driven by double digit growth at both Control Systems and Power Systems. Two percentage points of the growth was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, primarily resulting from the strength of the major European currencies and the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar. Sales rose by double digit percentages in all regions except for EMEA where difficult economic conditions dampened growth in the major economies of Western Europe, primarily France, Germany and the U.K. The emerging economies in Asia Pacific, led by China and India, experienced particularly strong growth. Strength of the oil and gas and mining industries in Latin America and oil and gas industry in Canada contributed to particularly strong sales growth in those regions. Sales in the global water/ wastewater, oil and gas, aggregate and cement, and mining industries grew at a rate higher than our annual growth rate of 13 percent. Sales in the food and transportation industries grew at rates approximate to our annual growth rate, while sales in life sciences, semiconductor, and beverage grew at a rate less than our annual growth rate. 21 Table of Contents Income from continuing operations benefited from higher volume, productivity programs and favorable pricing offset slightly by inflation in comparison to the prior year. Additionally, income from continuing operations in 2005 includes $19.7 million ($0.10 per share) of tax benefits related to the resolution of claims and other tax matters in connection with the closure of the 1998 through 2002 federal audit and $8.4 million after tax ($0.04 per share) of benefits related to insurance settlements, offset by $14.2 million after tax ($0.08 per share) related to special charges associated with restructuring activities in Europe and a U.S. plant closing. Income from continuing operations in 2004 includes $46.3 million ($0.24 per share) of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax matters and state tax refunds, offset by $16.3 million after tax ($0.09 per share) of special facilities related charges. Control Systems (in millions, except percentages) 2005 2004 Increase Sales $ 4,123.6 $ 3,658.6 $ 465.0 Segment operating earnings 756.9 527.9 229.0 Segment operating margin 18.4 % 14.4 % 4.0pts Control Systems sales increased 13 percent compared to 2004. Three percentage points of the sales increase was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, primarily resulting from the relative strength of the major European currencies and the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar. Sales of our Logix offering grew by more than 26 percent compared to 2004, which was somewhat offset by a decline in our legacy control platform products that are being replaced by Logix. Growth in sales of our Logix offering was driven by our introduction of new functionality and an expanded addressable market. Our intelligent motor control products also delivered significantly higher revenue driven by strong sales to extraction based and heavy industrial customers. Higher commodity prices and a renewed investment in energy efficiency programs led to the strong demand from these customers. Segment operating earnings increased by 43 percent compared to 2004. The increase in segment operating earnings is due to higher volume, cost productivity and favorable pricing that was somewhat offset by inflation. Control Systems 2005 results include $12.3 million (pre tax) of benefits related to insurance settlements offset by $16.5 million (pre tax) of special charges associated with realignment of administrative functions and a reduction in workforce in Europe. Prior year segment operating earnings includes a $26.3 million (pre tax) charge related to a facilities rationalization program. Power Systems (in millions, except percentages) 2005 2004 Increase Sales $ 879.6 $ 752.5 $ 127.1 Segment operating earnings 110.3 67.5 42.8 Segment operating margin 12.5 % 9.0 % 3.5pts Power Systems sales increased 17 percent compared to 2004 with growth in both our Dodge mechanical and Reliance electrical business groups. Growth was driven by demand from the power centric customers in heavy, extraction based industries such as mining and oil and gas. Higher commodity prices are causing the segments predominantly U.S. based customers to invest in capacity expansion after several years of under investment and reduced capital spending. Power Systems operating earnings grew 63 percent due to higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity somewhat offset by inflation and significantly higher material costs. Segment operating earnings in 2005 include a charge of $5.0 million (pre tax) associated with a facility closure and the corresponding write down of property to its fair value compared to $4.0 million (pre tax) of charges related to restructuring activities in 2004. 22 Table of Contents General Corporate Net General corporate expenses were $69.7 million in 2005 compared to $88.3 million in 2004. Expense dropped primarily due to decreased environmental costs, lower contributions to our charitable corporation and increased interest income. Interest Expense Interest expense was $45.8 million in 2005 compared to $41.7 million in 2004, primarily due to higher interest rates associated with our interest rate swap (see Note 6 in the Financial Statements). 2004 Compared to 2003 (in millions, except per share amounts) 2004 2003 Increase Sales $ 4,411.1 $ 3,992.3 $ 418.8 Income from continuing operations 354.1 281.4 72.7 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 1.85 1.48 0.37 Sales increased 10 percent compared to 2003 driven by growth at both Control Systems and Power Systems. Three percentage points of the growth was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates. Income from continuing operations in 2004 included $46.3 million ($0.24 per share) of tax benefits related to the resolution of certain tax matters as well as the benefit of state tax refunds. The 2003 results included a tax benefit of $69.4 million ($0.37 per share) related to the settlement of a U.S. federal research and experimentation credit refund claim. Control Systems (in millions, except percentages) 2004 2003 Increase Sales $ 3,658.6 $ 3,287.4 $ 371.2 Segment operating earnings 527.9 397.6 130.3 Segment operating margin 14.4 % 12.1 % 2.3pts Control Systems sales increased 11 percent compared to 2003. Four percentage points of the sales increase was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, primarily resulting from the relative strength of the euro to the U.S. dollar. Sales outside of the U.S. increased 15 percent (6 percent excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates) and U.S. sales increased 8 percent. Control Systems experienced sales growth in all regions with exceptional strength in the emerging economies of Asia and Latin America where we continued to increase market penetration. Sales growth was primarily driven by maintenance related and smaller productivity related projects. These projects were the result of pent up demand after the period of under investment in productive assets during 2002 and 2003. In addition to these investments, we experienced an increase in activity related to larger scale projects in the second half of fiscal year 2004. These larger projects were driven by our customers requirements for incremental productivity improvements and capacity optimization. Our Logix platform business continued its strong growth with an increase of 30 percent over 2003. Industrial components and adjustable speed drives experienced double digit growth as well. These gains were partially offset by moderate declines in drive systems and legacy control platforms. Segment operating margins increased due to higher volume, favorable product mix and productivity improvements. Volume leverage improved during the year due to our continuing productivity efforts and ongoing facility rationalization programs. 23 Table of Contents Power Systems (in millions, except percentages) 2004 2003 Increase Sales $ 752.5 $ 704.9 $ 47.6 Segment operating earnings 67.5 54.6 12.9 Segment operating margin 9.0 % 7.7 % 1.3pts Power Systems sales increased 7 percent compared to 2003. The Mechanical and Electrical business groups contributed about equally to the growth. The sales increase was mainly the result of volume strength in the second half of 2004. Higher global demand for basic materials and subsequent higher prices for these materials encouraged significant investment in capacity optimization and productivity and drove our sales. Significant cost and productivity initiatives launched in the second quarter of 2004, financial leverage on incremental volume and price increases more than offset rising raw material prices, resulting in the improved segment operating margin. General Corporate Net General corporate expenses were $88.3 million in 2004 compared to $66.8 million in 2003. Expense in 2004 includes charges of $16.4 million due to higher estimated costs for environmental remediation at several legacy sites, $7.0 million of contributions to our charitable corporation and $5.0 million of costs associated with corporate staff changes. Expense in 2003 included a charge of $4.7 million due to higher estimated future costs for environmental remediation at a legacy site. Loss on Disposition of a Business In the second quarter of 2003, we sold a majority of our ownership interest in Reliance Electric Limited Japan (REJ) resulting in a loss of $8.4 million ($2.5 million after tax, or $0.01 per diluted share). The cash proceeds from the transaction totaled $10.4 million. Interest Expense Interest expense was $41.7 million in 2004 compared to $52.5 million in 2003. The decrease was the result of the retirement at maturity of the $150.0 million principal amount of 6.80% notes in April 2003, the benefit of an interest rate swap (see Note 6 in the Financial Statements) and lower average short term borrowings. Discontinued Operations See Note 13 and Note 16 in the Financial Statements for information regarding discontinued operations. Income Taxes During 2005, we recognized tax benefits of $19.7 million ($0.10 per diluted share) related to the resolution of claims and other tax matters in connection with the closure of the federal audit cycle for the years 1998 through 2002. In 2004, we recognized tax benefits of $46.3 million ($0.24 per diluted share) related to the following items: $34.5 million resulting from the resolution of certain tax matters primarily related to former businesses. A majority of the benefits recognized related to non U.S. tax matters in addition to an agreement with a taxing authority related to the treatment of an investment; $4.3 million related to additional state tax benefits associated with the U.S. research and experimentation credit refund claim in 2003 (see discussion below); and $7.5 million related to a refund from the State of California for the period 1989 to 1991. 24 Table of Contents During 2003, we recognized a net tax benefit of $69.4 million ($0.37 per diluted share) related to a U.S. federal research and experimentation credit refund claim and a tax benefit of approximately $2.6 million as a result of our ability to utilize certain capital loss carryforwards for which a valuation allowance had been previously provided. The full year effective tax rate for 2005 was 29.7 percent as compared to 19.2 percent for 2004. The discrete items described above decreased the effective tax rate by 2.6 percent in 2005 and 10.5 percent in 2004. The full year effective tax rate for 2003 was 5.4 percent, including the effect of the research and experimentation settlement (23.3 percent benefit) and the utilization of capital loss carryforwards (0.9 percent benefit). See Note 16 in the Financial Statements for a reconciliation of the United States statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate. Current and projected growth in income in higher tax jurisdictions has resulted, and may continue to result, in an increasing effective tax rate over time. We expect that the effective income tax rate in 2006 will be approximately 33.5 percent, excluding the income tax expense or benefit related to discrete items, if any, that will be separately reported or reported net of their related tax effects. See Note 13 and Note 16 in the Financial Statements for information on tax matters related to discontinued operations. Financial Condition The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (in millions): Year Ended September 30, 2005 2004 2003 Cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 638.9 $ 596.9 $ 419.9 Investing activities (122.8 ) (65.2 ) (131.4 ) Financing activities (550.6 ) (312.0 ) (335.3 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (3.1 ) 1.8 (31.0 ) Cash (used for) provided by continuing operations $ (37.6 ) $ 221.5 $ (77.8 ) The following table summarizes free cash flow (in millions): Cash provided by operating activities $ 638.9 $ 596.9 $ 419.9 Capital expenditures (124.1 ) (98.0 ) (107.6 ) Free cash flow $ 514.8 $ 498.9 $ 312.3 Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investment required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies. Free cash flow was $514.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2005 compared to $498.9 million for the year ended September 30, 2004. Increased pre tax earnings more than offset the increase in voluntary contributions to our U.S. pension plan ($150.0 million in 2005 compared to $125.0 million in 2004), capital spending and working capital needs. The increased capital spending includes investments in information technology and certain long lived asset replacements. 25 Table of Contents When necessary, we utilize commercial paper as our principal source of short term financing. At September 30, 2005 and 2004, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. During 2005 we had no commercial paper borrowings and during 2004 we did not have significant commercial paper borrowings due to our cash position. In January 2004, we repaid our $8.4 million of industrial development revenue bonds prior to maturity using cash on hand. In April 2003, we repaid our $150.0 million principal amount of 6.80% notes at maturity using a combination of cash on hand and commercial paper borrowings. In 2005, we repurchased approximately 9.8 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $499.2 million, compared to repurchases of approximately 7.5 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $258.4 million in 2004. We anticipate repurchasing stock in 2006, the amount of which will depend ultimately on business conditions, stock price and other cash requirements. At September 30, 2005 we had authorization from our Board of Directors to purchase up to approximately 8.8 million additional shares through September 30, 2006. In October 2005, we contributed $450 million to our U.S. qualified pension trust. The contribution was funded with a combination of cash on hand and $300 million of commercial paper borrowings. In November 2005, we sold 24 owned properties in a sale leaseback transaction for net cash proceeds of approximately $148 million. The cash proceeds were used to repay commercial paper borrowings. We expect future significant uses of cash to include capital expenditures, dividends to shareowners, repayments of short term borrowings, acquisitions of businesses and repurchases of common stock and may include additional contributions to our pension plans. We expect capital expenditures in 2006 to be about $150 million. We expect that each of these future uses of cash will be funded by existing cash balances, cash generated by operating activities, commercial paper borrowings, a new issue of debt or issuance of other securities. In addition to cash generated by operating activities, we have access to existing financing sources, including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks. Our debt to total capital ratio was 31.2 percent at September 30, 2005 and 28.9 percent at September 30, 2004. In October 2004, we entered into a five year $600.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced our then existing $675.0 million unsecured credit facilities. Borrowings under our credit facility bear interest based on short term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding. The terms of our credit facility contain a covenant under which we would be in default if our debt to total capital ratio were to exceed 60 percent. In addition to our $600.0 million credit facility, short term unsecured credit facilities of approximately $115 million at September 30, 2005 were available to foreign subsidiaries. The following is a summary of our credit ratings as of September 30, 2005: Short Term Long Term Credit Rating Agency Rating Outlook Rating Outlook Standard & Poors A 1 Stable A Stable Moodys P 2 Stable A3 Stable Fitch Ratings F1 Stable A Stable Moodys changed its long term outlook from negative to stable during the second quarter of 2005 to reflect our leading position in the global industrial automation market, our healthy balance sheet and solid cash flow generation. Among other things, we can draw our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility, to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures. This access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the ratings set forth in the table above that have been given to our commercial paper. Under our current policy with respect to these ratings, we expect to limit our other borrowings under the credit facility, if any, to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures. 26 Table of Contents If our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the unsecured committed credit facilities to provide short term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings. Cash dividends to shareowners were $142.7 million ($0.78 per share) in 2005 and $122.5 million ($0.66 per share) in 2004. Although declaration and payment of dividends are at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, we expect to continue to pay quarterly dividends in 2006 of $0.225 per outstanding share. Certain of our contractual cash obligations at September 30, 2005 are: Payments by Period Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Long term debt and interest(a) $ 2,192.7 $ 48.7 $ 48.7 $ 387.9 $ 27.1 $ 27.1 $ 1,653.2 Minimum operating lease payments(b) 206.5 51.5 45.2 37.3 26.4 15.0 31.1 Total $ 2,399.2 $ 100.2 $ 93.9 $ 425.2 $ 53.5 $ 42.1 $ 1,684.3 (a) The amounts for long term debt assume that the respective debt instruments will be outstanding until their scheduled maturity dates. The amounts include interest, but exclude the amounts to be received under an interest rate swap, the $(6.3) million fair value adjustment recorded for the interest rate swap as permitted by SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, and the unamortized discount of $45.5 million. See Note 6 in the Financial Statements for additional information regarding our long term debt. (b) See Note 20 in the Financial Statements for information regarding our November 2005, sale leaseback transaction. We sponsor pension and other postretirement benefit plans for certain employees. See Note 12 in the Financial Statements for information regarding these plans and expected future cash outflows related to the plans. At September 30, 2005, we and Rockwell Collins each guarantee one half of a lease agreement for one of Rockwell Scientific Company LLCs (RSC) facilities. The total future minimum payments under the lease are $4.8 million. The lease agreement has a term that ends in December 2011. In addition, we share equally with Rockwell Collins in providing a $6.0 million line of credit to RSC, which bears interest at the greater of our or Rockwell Collins commercial paper borrowing rate. At September 30, 2005 and 2004, there were no outstanding borrowings under this line of credit. Supplemental Sales Information We translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States using exchange rates effective during the respective period. Therefore, reported sales are affected by changes in currency rates, which are outside of our control. We believe that sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which is a non GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates. We use sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates to monitor and evaluate our regional performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective periods sales using the same currency exchange rates as were in effect in the preceding year. We attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of origin. 27 Table of Contents The following is a reconciliation of our reported sales to sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates (in millions): Year Ended September 30, 2005 Year Ended September 30, 2004 Sales Sales Excluding Excluding the Effect the Effect of Changes of Changes in Currency in Currency Currency Exchange Currency Exchange Sales Translation Rates Sales Translation Rates US $ 3,058.8 $ $ 3,058.8 $ 2,727.0 $ $ 2,727.0 Canada 418.4 (32.4 ) 386.0 339.8 (30.9 ) 308.9 Europe, Middle East and Africa 823.5 (36.4 ) 787.1 779.6 (83.1 ) 696.5 Asia Pacific 483.1 (20.5 ) 462.6 400.4 (21.0 ) 379.4 Latin America 219.4 (11.1 ) 208.3 164.3 2.5 166.8 Total Company Sales $ 5,003.2 $ (100.4 ) $ 4,902.8 $ 4,411.1 $ (132.5 ) $ 4,278.6 The following is a reconciliation of reported sales of our Control Systems segment to sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates (in millions): Year Ended September 30, 2005 Year Ended September 30, 2004 Sales Sales Excluding Excluding the Effect the Effect of Changes of Changes in Currency in Currency Currency Exchange Currency Exchange Sales Translation Rates Sales Translation Rates US $ 2,275.5 $ $ 2,275.5 $ 2,054.2 $ $ 2,054.2 Canada 370.0 (28.7 ) 341.3 302.4 (27.4 ) 275.0 Europe, Middle East and Africa 815.4 (36.1 ) 779.3 766.0 (81.6 ) 684.4 Asia Pacific 457.7 (20.3 ) 437.4 382.9 (21.0 ) 361.9 Latin America 205.0 (11.0 ) 194.0 153.1 1.7 154.8 Total Control Systems Sales $ 4,123.6 $ (96.1 ) $ 4,027.5 $ 3,658.6 $ (128.3 ) $ 3,530.3 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management. Retirement Benefits Pension Benefits Pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts, including the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, the assumed annual compensation increase rate, retirement rate, mortality rate and employee turnover rate. Changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense recognized in future periods. Our global pension expense in 2005 was $66.2 million compared to $68.8 million in 2004. Approximately 80 percent of our 2005 global pension expense relates to our U.S. qualified pension plan. The actuarial 28 Table of Contents assumptions used to determine our 2005 U.S. pension expense included the following: discount rate of 6.25 percent (compared to 6.00 percent for 2004); expected rate of return on plan assets of 8.50 percent (compared to 8.50 percent for 2004); and an assumed compensation increase rate of 4.50 percent (compared to 4.50 percent for 2004). In 2005, we made voluntary contributions of $150.0 million to our primary U.S. qualified pension plan trust compared to $125.0 million in 2004. We estimate our pension expense will be approximately $82 million in 2006, an increase of approximately $16 million over 2005. Our estimated 2006 pension expense reflects the following changes in the U.S. pension plan: the net cost related to changes in actuarial assumptions; the benefit of a $100 million contribution in September 2005 and a $450 million contribution in October 2005; and the benefit related to a plan amendment that eliminates the early retirement subsidy for certain employees. For 2006, changes in actuarial assumptions include a 100 basis point reduction in our discount rate to 5.25 percent from the 6.25 percent used in 2005. The discount rate is set as of our June 30th measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans. Our assumed rate of return on plan assets will remain at 8.50 percent, consistent with 2005. We considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term as well as the current and expected mix of plan investments in setting this assumption. We have assumed a compensation increase rate of 4.06 percent in 2006, compared to 4.50 percent used in 2005. We established this rate using an analysis of all elements of employee compensation that are considered pension eligible earnings. Additionally, in establishing our 2006 pension assumptions, we performed an actuarial experience study that changed other assumptions including retirement rate, employee turnover rate, and mortality rate as a result of utilizing the RP2000 table projected forward 10 years. Effective for 2006, we amended our U.S. pension plan to eliminate the early retirement subsidy for certain employees. The effect of the amendment is a reduction of approximately $70 million in our pension benefit obligation and a corresponding reduction in annual pension expense recognized over the average remaining service life of plan participants. The following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the assumptions for our U.S. pension plans (in millions): Pension Benefits Change in Change in Projected Benefit Net Periodic Obligation Benefit Cost Discount Rate $ 75.5 $ 8.1 Rate of Return 4.1 Additional information regarding pension benefits, including our pension obligation and minimum pension liability adjustment, is contained in Note 12 in the Financial Statements. Other Postretirement Benefits We estimate, with the assistance of third party actuarial consultants, the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits other than pensions using assumptions, including the discount rate and, for plans other than our primary U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit program, expected trends in the cost for healthcare services. Changes in these assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods. The discount rate used to calculate our 2005 other postretirement benefits expense was 6.25 percent (compared to 6.00 percent in 29 Table of Contents 2004). For 2006, the discount rate assumption for other postretirement benefit expense will decrease to 5.0 percent. Effective October 1, 2002, we amended our primary U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit program in order to mitigate our share of the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare services. As a result of this amendment to our primary U.S. program, there is no increase in healthcare costs resulting from healthcare inflationary trends as of January 1, 2005. Net periodic benefit cost in 2005 was $24.9 million compared to $23.4 million in 2004. We expect net periodic benefit cost in 2006 of approximately $36 million and the estimated postretirement projected benefit obligation to approximate $425 million. The expected increases are primarily due to the decrease in discount rate (as of our June 30, 2005 measurement date) by 125 basis points to 5.0 percent. Additional information regarding postretirement benefits is contained in Note 12 in the Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition We record sales of products and services, representing approximately 90% of our consolidated sales, when all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists; pricing is fixed or determinable; collection is reasonably assured; and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred, as may be required according to contract terms, or services have been rendered. We recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales on construction type contracts using either the percentage of completion or completed contract methods of accounting. We record sales relating to these contracts using the percentage of completion method when we determine that progress towards completion is reasonably and reliably estimable; we use the completed contract method for all others. Under the percentage of completion method, we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using either (i) the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion or (ii) units of delivery. Under the percentage of completion method, we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified. We record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified. We use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale. We use shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis, as well as the customers payment history. Returns, Rebates and Incentives Our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the end user or original equipment manufacturing (OEM) customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product. We also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates, account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria. Certain distributors are offered a right to return product, subject to contractual limitations. We record accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience. Adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns, rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual. A critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed. If the time period were to change by 10 percent, the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately $5.0 million. 30 Table of Contents Returns, rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits. Rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided. Accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or, where a right of set off exists, as a reduction of accounts receivable. The accrual for customer returns, rebates and incentives was $117.6 million at September 30, 2005 and $86.1 million at September 30, 2004, of which $9.4 million at September 30, 2005 and $7.8 million at September 30, 2004 was included as an offset to accounts receivable. Impairment of Long Lived Assets We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable through future cash flows. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. We use judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment test is necessary. Factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used and significant negative industry or economic trends. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value. To determine fair value, we must make estimates of the future cash flows related to the asset being reviewed. These estimates require assumptions about demand for our products and services, future market conditions and technological developments. Other assumptions include the discount rate and future growth rates. We perform our annual impairment test on non amortized intangible assets during the second quarter of our fiscal year. As of the second quarter of 2005, the estimated fair value of our Reliance trademark exceeded its $72.8 million net book value. We calculated the estimated fair value with the assistance of third party valuation specialists. Either an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in planned future growth or profitability of our Electrical (Reliance) business group could result in an impairment charge to write down the book value of the Reliance trademark to the revised estimated fair value. Litigation, Claims and Contingencies We record liabilities for litigation, claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation. We also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures utilizing information received from independent environmental consultants. The liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own and third party sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party. At third party sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. At environmental sites where we are the only responsible party, we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation. We do not discount future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their present value. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup. To the extent that remediation procedures change, additional contamination is identified, or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected, the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change. The reserve for environmental matters, net of related receivables, was $39.3 million at September 30, 2005 and $38.8 million at September 30, 2004. During 2005, we recorded adjustments totaling $8.5 million to increase the environmental reserves related to several legacy sites compared to 2004 adjustments of $16.9 million. Our recorded liability for environmental matters almost entirely relates to businesses formerly owned by us (legacy businesses) for which we retained the responsibility to remediate. The nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to 31 Table of Contents earnings is low. As a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters, we expect that gradually, over a long period of time, our environmental obligations will decline. However, changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations. Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product liability. As described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago. See Item 3 for further discussion. Our principal self insurance programs include product liability where we are self insured up to a specified dollar amount. Claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies purchased from commercial insurers. We estimate the reserve for product liability claims, excluding asbestos, with the assistance of a third party actuarial consultant using our claims experience for the periods being valued. Adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims. The reserve for product liability claims was $29.5 million at September 30, 2005 and $32.3 million at September 30, 2004. Additional information regarding litigation, claims and contingencies is contained in Note 17 in the Financial Statements. Income Taxes We operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by various U.S. Federal, state and foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods. Additionally, we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years. Our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction, the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. While we have support for the positions taken on our tax returns, taxing authorities are increasingly asserting interpretations of laws and facts and challenging cross jurisdictional transactions. Cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products, services, and or intellectual property as well as various U.S. state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures. We regularly assess our position with regard to tax exposures and record liabilities for these uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties, if any, according to the principles of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We have recorded an accrual of $103.1 million at September 30, 2005 that reflects our estimate of the likely outcome of current and future audits and is recorded in Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A final determination of these tax audits or changes in our estimates may result in additional future income tax expense or benefit. We have recorded a valuation allowance of $55.5 million at September 30, 2005 for the majority of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards, capital loss carryforwards and state tax credit carryforwards (Carryforwards) based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction. The valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty of the amounts of the Carryforwards that are expected to be realized. Our income would increase if we determine we will be able to utilize more Carryforwards than currently expected. At the end of each interim reporting period, we estimate the effective tax rate expected to apply to the full fiscal year. The estimated effective tax rate contemplates the expected jurisdiction where income is earned as well as tax planning strategies. Current and projected growth in income in higher tax jurisdictions has resulted, and may continue to result, in an increasing effective tax rate over time. If the actual results differ from our estimates, we may have to adjust the effective tax rate in the interim period such determination is made. 32 Table of Contents Additional information regarding income taxes is contained in Note 16 in the Financial Statements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Interest Rate Risk In addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities, we use a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations. We are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations. Our short term debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings. At September 30, 2005 and 2004, we had no commercial paper or bank borrowings outstanding. During 2005, we had no commercial paper borrowings. In 2004, the weighted average commercial paper borrowing was $1.8 million. Changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations. If market interest rates would have averaged 10 percent higher than actual levels in either 2005 or 2004, the effect on our results of operations would not have been significant. In October 2005, we issued $300 million of unsecured commercial paper obligations with maturities of 1 to 28 days. We used the proceeds of the commercial paper to partially fund a $450 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. qualified pension plan trust made on October 11, 2005. As these obligations mature, we anticipate issuing additional short term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. We had outstanding fixed rate long term debt obligations with carrying values of $748.2 million at September 30, 2005 and $757.7 million at September 30, 2004. The fair value of this debt was $826.2 million at September 30, 2005 and $837.1 million at September 30, 2004. The potential reduction in fair value on such fixed rate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt. We currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed rate instruments and, therefore, fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners equity. In September 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap contract that effectively converted our $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.15% notes, payable in 2008, to floating rate debt based on six month LIBOR. The floating rate was 6.23 percent at September 30, 2005. A hypothetical 10 percent change in market interest rates would not be significant to the overall fair value of the swap or our results of operations. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage our exposure on transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency. In addition, we enter into contracts to hedge certain forecasted intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next four years. Contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. We do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to United States dollars. A 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations. 33 Table of Contents We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings. For derivatives that are hedges, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We recognize the ineffective portion of a derivatives change in fair value in earnings immediately. At September 30, 2005 and 2004, we had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts to exchange the euro, Swiss franc, Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, and Australian dollar for U.S. dollars. The use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations. 34 Table of Contents
