Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Non GAAP Measures The following discussion includes sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and free cash flow, which are non GAAP measures. See Supplemental Sales Information for a reconciliation of reported sales to sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates in addition to a discussion of why we believe this non GAAP measure is useful to investors. See Financial Condition for a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow and a discussion of why we believe this non GAAP measure is useful to investors. Overview Overall demand for our products and services is driven by: Investments in manufacturing capacity, including upgrades, modifications, and expansions of existing manufacturing facilities, and the creation of new manufacturing facilities; Our customers needs for greater productivity, cost reduction, quality, and overall global competitiveness; Industry factors that include our customers new product introductions, trends in the actual and forecasted demand for our customers products or services, and the regulatory and competitive environments in which our customers operate; Levels of global industrial production; Regional factors that include local political, social, regulatory and economic circumstances; and The seasonal capital spending patterns of our customers due to their annual capital budgeting processes and their working schedules. U. S. Industrial Economic Trends In 2006, sales in the U.S. accounted for more than 62 percent of our total sales. The trend of improving conditions in the U.S. manufacturing economy during 2004 and 2005 continued into the first half of 2006 and moderated somewhat in the second half. The various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served markets include: Industrial Equipment Spending, which is an economic statistic compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This statistic provides insight into spending trends in the broad U.S. industrial economy, which includes our primary customer base. This measure, over the longer term, has proven to have reasonable predictive value, and to be a good directional indicator of our growth trend. Capacity Utilization, which is an indication of plant operating activity published by the Federal Reserve. Historically there has been a meaningful correlation between Capacity Utilization and the level of capital investment made by our customers in their manufacturing base. The Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which is an indication of the level of manufacturing activity in the U.S. According to the ISM, a PMI measure above 50 indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below 50 indicates that it is generally contracting. 16 The table below depicts the continued gradual improvement in U.S. Industrial Equipment Spending and Capacity Utilization, and the sustained strength in the PMI since December 2003. While we still expect moderate growth in 2007, we are planning for a deceleration to a more sustainable level of growth in the U.S. economy in 2007.

Non U.S. Regional Trends Outside the U.S., demand is principally driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region and by our customers ability and propensity to invest in their manufacturing assets. These customers may include both multinational companies with expanding global presence and growing indigenous companies. Recent strength in demand has, in part, been driven by investment in infrastructure in developing economies, in basic materials production capacity in response to higher end product pricing and in expanding consumer markets. We continue to see strong demand in China, India and Latin America. We also saw considerable growth in Europe during the second half of 2006, following nearly two years of little or no growth. In 2006, our European operations benefited from our targeted growth investments in customer facing resources as well as improving macro economic conditions. We expect strong growth in Latin America, Europe and the emerging economies in Asia Pacific will continue into 2007. Revenue by Geographic Region The table below presents our actual sales for the year ended September 30, 2006 by geographic region and the change in sales from the year ended September 30, 2005 (in millions, except percentages): Change Excluding the Effect of Changes Change vs. In Currency Exchange Year Ended Year Ended Rates vs. Year Ended September 30, 2006(1) September 30, 2005 September 30, 2005(2) U.S. and Canada $ 3,827.1 12% 11% Europe, Middle East and Africa 856.5 4% 7% Asia Pacific 573.1 11% 11% Latin America 304.7 26% 19% Total sales $ 5,561.4 11% 11% (1) We attribute sales to the geographic regions based upon country of destination.

During 2006 we benefited from growing demand in most of the industries we serve. Our consumer products customers are engaged in the food and beverage; home, health and beauty; and life sciences industries. These customers needs include global expansion, incremental capacity from existing facilities, an increasingly flexible manufacturing environment and regulatory compliance. In addition, these customers operate in an environment where product innovation and time to market are critical factors. As a result, consumer products customers capital investments are generally less cyclical than those of heavy manufacturing customers. In transportation, factors such as plant closings, customer investment in new model introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies affect our sales. While our global automotive revenue was flat in 2006, our traditional North American automotive installed base experienced a significant slowdown during the second half of the year. This had a negative impact on sales and operating earnings in our Control Systems business, primarily on sales of our Logix and PLC products. Our plan for 2007 does not anticipate any recovery. Our customers in basic materials industries, including mining, aggregates, metals, forest products and cement, all benefit from higher commodity prices and higher global demand for basic materials, both of which encourage investment in capacity and productivity in these industries. As energy prices rise, customers in the oil and gas industry increase their investment in production and transmission capacity. During 2006, high energy prices contributed to strong growth in resource and energy based industries. In addition, higher energy prices have historically caused customers across all industries to consider investing in more energy efficient manufacturing processes and technologies, such as intelligent motor controls. Outlook for 2007 The following is a summary of key objectives for 2007: Successfully complete the divestiture of the principal businesses of our Power Systems operating segment; Execute our cost productivity initiatives; Continue our globalization efforts with a particular focus on emerging markets; and Sustain the growth of our integrated control and information architecture by accelerating the proliferation and adoption rate, enhancing features and functionality, and by aggressively pursuing growth in an expanded addressable market. Our key objectives assume a certain amount of cost productivity in 2007. Our cost productivity initiatives will likely include workforce reductions and facility rationalization. These actions are consistent with the planned divestiture of most of our Power Systems operating segment and our globalization and cost productivity efforts. Costs associated with these actions will be recorded when the relevant recognition criteria have been met. Our outlook for 2007 is based on expected demand and assumes sustained momentum outside of North America with slower rates of growth in the U.S. and Canada than in the previous three years. Our outlook also assumes sustained momentum across most industrial end markets. The actual growth reported in any particular quarter may out perform or lag that trend. This oscillation of performance around a trend is attributed to the inherent variability in our business with short lead times and minimal backlog in our non project businesses. Extrapolation of growth rates or levels of profitability from any one quarter can lead to incorrect conclusions about future performance. As of the date of filing this report, based upon current economic conditions and business trends, we expect to grow revenue in 2007 by 7 to 8 percent, consistent with our long term growth trend. As of the date hereof, we also expect full year 2007 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $3.70 to $3.90. This includes an expected effective income tax rate that will average about 32 percent for the full year, excluding the effect of acquisitions, divestitures or other items separately reported net of their related tax effects. This tax rate assumes continued execution of our globalization strategy. We also plan to generate free cash flow approximately equal to net income. This guidance does not incorporate the impact of future acquisitions or divestures, including the planned divestiture of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses. 18 Summary of Results of Operations Year Ended September 30, 2006 2005 2004 (in millions) Sales: Control Systems $ 4,551.3 $ 4,123.6 $ 3,658.6 Power Systems 1,010.1 879.6 752.5 Total $ 5,561.4 $ 5,003.2 $ 4,411.1 Segment operating earnings (a): Control Systems $ 873.1 $ 756.9 $ 527.9 Power Systems 162.6 110.3 67.5 Total 1,035.7 867.2 595.4 Purchase accounting depreciation and amortization (13.3 ) (14.7 ) (27.3 ) General corporate net (92.5 ) (69.7 ) (88.3 ) Interest expense (58.4 ) (45.8 ) (41.7 ) Gain on sale of investment (b) 19.9 Income from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change 891.4 737.0 438.1 Provision for income taxes (c) (263.3 ) (218.6 ) (84.0 ) Income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change 628.1 518.4 354.1 (Loss) income from discontinued operations (d) (3.0 ) 21.6 60.8 Cumulative effect of accounting change (e) (18.1 ) Net income $ 607.0 $ 540.0 $ 414.9 (a) Information regarding how we define segment operating earnings is included in Note 18 in the Financial Statements.

Total sales were not significantly affected year over year by changes in currency exchange rates. Sales in the U.S. and Canada increased by 11 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Sales in the U.S. and Canada benefited from the strength in our power centric businesses, however, were negatively impacted by the weakness in the North American automotive market in the second half of the year. Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew by 11 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 with particularly strong growth in the emerging economies, including China and India. Latin America sales grew by 19 percent in 2006 compared to 2005, excluding the effect of currency translation, led by strength in the oil and gas and mining industries. Sales in Europe grew by 7 percent in 2006 compared to 2005, excluding the effects of currency translation. Europe experienced considerable growth during the second half of 2006. Our operations in Europe benefited from our investment in customer facing resources and improving macro economic conditions. Segment Operating Earnings Segment operating earnings increased by $168.5 million from 2005 to $1,035.7 million in 2006. Segment operating earnings benefited from higher volume, productivity programs and favorable pricing, partially offset by inflation and higher growth initiative spending in comparison to the prior year. Segment operating earnings in 2006 include $19.8 million of stock compensation expense due to the adoption of a new accounting standard, SFAS 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)). Additionally, 2006 results include $27.3 million of increased pension and retiree medical expense compared to 2005. Segment operating earnings in 2005 include a benefit of $12.3 million related to an insurance settlement and a charge of $21.5 million related to special charges associated with restructuring activities in Europe and a U.S. plant closing. General Corporate Net General corporate expenses were $92.5 million in 2006 compared to $69.7 million in 2005. The increase includes $9.7 million of stock compensation expense, lower interest income and higher contributions to the Rockwell Automation Charitable Corporation. Interest Expense Interest expense was $58.4 million in 2006 compared to $45.8 million in 2005. The increase was due to our commercial paper borrowings during 2006, as well as higher interest rates associated with our interest rate swap (see Note 6 in the Financial Statements). Income Taxes The effective tax rate for 2006 was 29.5 percent compared to 29.7 percent in 2005. The 2006 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 percent due to the reversal of $27.2 million ($0.15 per diluted share) of valuation allowances on capital loss carryforwards, settlement of audit matters with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for the years 2003 and 2004, lower non U.S. tax rates, Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) and Extra Territorial Income (ETI) tax benefits and other provision adjustments. The effective tax rate for 2005 was lower than the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent due to a benefit of $19.7 million ($0.10 per diluted share) related to the settlement of audit matters with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for the years 1998 through 2002, utilization of foreign tax credits, FSC and ETI tax benefits and other provision adjustments. See Note 16 in the Financial Statements for additional information on tax events in 2006 and 2005 affecting the respective tax rates. 20 Discontinued Operations See Note 13 and Note 16 in the Financial Statements regarding discontinued operations.

Sales in the U.S. and Canada increased by 11 percent in 2006 compared to 2005, excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Sales in the U.S. and Canada benefited from the strength in our power centric businesses, however, were negatively impacted by the weakness in the North American automotive market in the second half of the year. Sales in the Asia Pacific region grew by 9 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 with particularly strong growth in the emerging economies including China and India. Latin America sales grew by 19 percent in 2006 compared to 2005, excluding the effect of currency translation, led by strength in the oil and gas and mining industries. European sales grew by 7 percent in 2006 compared to 2005, excluding the effects of currency translation. Europe experienced considerable growth in the second half of 2006. Our operations in Europe benefited from our investment in customer facing resources and improving macro economic conditions. Operating Earnings Segment operating earnings grew 15% due to higher volume, productivity programs, lower restructuring costs and favorable pricing, partially offset by inflation and higher growth initiative spending in comparison to the prior year. Segment operating earnings in 2006 include $15.8 million of stock compensation expense due to the adoption of a new accounting standard, SFAS 123(R). Additionally, 2006 results include $21.5 million of increased pension and retiree medical expense compared to 2005. Segment operating earnings in 2005 include a benefit of $12.3 million related to an insurance settlement and a charge of $16.5 million related to special charges associated with restructuring activities in Europe. Power Systems (in millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 Increase Sales $ 1,010.1 $ 879.6 $ 130.5 Segment operating earnings 162.6 110.3 52.3 Segment operating margin 16.1 % 12.5 % 3.6pts Sales Power Systems sales increased 15 percent compared to 2005 with growth in both our Dodge mechanical and Reliance electrical business groups. Sales at Power Systems benefited from continued strong momentum resulting from high energy and commodity prices. These higher prices resulted in the segments predominantly U.S. based customers investing in capacity expansion after several years of under investment and reduced capital spending. Operating Earnings Power Systems operating earnings grew 47 percent due to higher volume, productivity initiatives, a balanced dynamic between price and cost, and lower restructuring costs, somewhat offset by inflation. Segment operating earnings in 2006 include stock compensation expense of $4.0 million and increased pension and retiree medical expense of $5.8 million compared to 2005. Segment operating earnings in 2005 include a charge of $5.0 million associated with a facility closure and the corresponding write down of property to its fair value. 21 2005 Compared to 2004 (in millions, except per share amounts) 2005 2004 Increase Sales $ 5,003.2 $ 4,411.1 $ 592.1 Income from continuing operations 518.4 354.1 164.3 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations 2.77 1.85 0.92 Sales Sales increased 13 percent compared to 2004 driven by double digit growth at both Control Systems and Power Systems. Two percentage points of the growth was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, primarily resulting from the strength of the major European currencies and the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar. Sales rose by double digit percentages in all regions except for EMEA where difficult economic conditions dampened growth in the major economies of Western Europe, primarily France, Germany and the U.K. The emerging economies in Asia Pacific, led by China and India, experienced particularly strong growth. Strength of the oil and gas and mining industries in Latin America and oil and gas industry in Canada contributed to particularly strong sales growth in those regions. Sales in the global water/wastewater, oil and gas, aggregate and cement, and mining industries grew at a rate higher than our annual growth rate of 13 percent. Sales in the food and transportation industries grew at rates approximate to our annual growth rate, while sales in life sciences, semiconductor, and beverage grew at a rate less than our annual growth rate. Segment Operating Earnings Segment operating earnings benefited from higher volume, productivity programs and favorable pricing offset slightly by inflation in comparison to the prior year. Additionally, segment operating earnings in 2005 include $21.5 million related to special charges associated with restructuring activities in Europe and a U.S. plant closing, offset by $12.3 million of benefits received related to insurance settlements. Segment operating earnings in 2004 include $26.3 million for special facilities related charges. General Corporate Net General corporate expenses were $69.7 million in 2005 compared to $88.3 million in 2004. Expense decreased primarily due to reduced environmental costs, lower contributions to our charitable corporation and increased interest income. Interest Expense Interest expense was $45.8 million in 2005 compared to $41.7 million in 2004, primarily due to higher interest rates associated with our interest rate swap (see Note 6 in the Financial Statements). Income Taxes The effective tax rate was 29.7 percent in 2005 and 19.2 percent in 2004. The effective tax rate for 2005 was lower than the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent due to a benefit of $19.7 million ($0.10 per diluted share) related to the settlement of audit matters with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for the years 1998 through 2002, utilization of foreign tax credits, FSC and ETI tax benefits and other provision adjustments. The effective tax rate for 2004 was lower than the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent due to benefits totaling $46.3 million ($0.24 per diluted share) from the resolution of various tax matters in non U.S. jurisdictions, state tax benefits involving refund claims, lower non U.S. tax rates, FSC and ETI tax benefits and other provision adjustments. See Note 16 in the Financial Statements for a complete reconciliation of the United States statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate and additional information on tax events in 2005 and 2004 affecting the respective tax rates. Discontinued Operations See Note 13 and Note 16 in the Financial Statements regarding discontinued operations. 22 Control Systems (in millions, except percentages) 2005 2004 Increase Sales $ 4,123.6 $ 3,658.6 $ 465.0 Segment operating earnings 756.9 527.9 229.0 Segment operating margin 18.4 % 14.4 % 4.0pts Sales Control Systems sales increased 13 percent compared to 2004. Three percentage points of the sales increase was due to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, primarily resulting from the relative strength of the major European currencies and the Canadian dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar. Sales of our Logix offering grew by more than 26 percent compared to 2004, which was somewhat offset by a decline in our legacy control platform products that are being replaced by Logix. Growth in sales of our Logix offering was driven by our introduction of new functionality and an expanded addressable market. Our intelligent motor control products also delivered significantly higher revenue driven by strong sales to extraction based and heavy industrial customers. Higher commodity prices and a renewed investment in energy efficiency programs led to the strong demand from these customers. Operating Earnings Segment operating earnings increased by 43 percent compared to 2004. The increase in segment operating earnings is due to higher volume, cost productivity and favorable pricing that was somewhat offset by inflation. Control Systems 2005 results include $12.3 million of benefits related to insurance settlements offset by $16.5 million of special charges associated with realignment of administrative functions and a reduction in workforce in Europe. Prior year segment operating earnings include a $26.3 million charge related to a facilities rationalization program. Power Systems (in millions, except percentages) 2005 2004 Increase Sales $ 879.6 $ 752.5 $ 127.1 Segment operating earnings 110.3 67.5 42.8 Segment operating margin 12.5 % 9.0 % 3.5pts Sales Power Systems sales increased 17 percent compared to 2004 with growth in both our Dodge mechanical and Reliance electrical business groups. Growth was driven by demand from the power centric customers in heavy, extraction based industries such as mining and oil and gas. Higher commodity prices are causing the segments predominantly U.S. based customers to invest in capacity expansion after several years of under investment and reduced capital spending. Operating Earnings Power Systems operating earnings grew 63 percent due to higher volume, favorable pricing and productivity somewhat offset by inflation and significantly higher material costs. Segment operating earnings in 2005 include a charge of $5.0 million associated with a facility closure and the corresponding write down of property to its fair value compared to $4.0 million of charges related to restructuring activities in 2004. 23 Financial Condition The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (in millions): Year Ended September 30, 2006 2005 2004 Cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 426.2 $ 638.9 $ 596.9 Investing activities 82.5 (122.8 ) (65.2 ) Financing activities (556.4 ) (550.6 ) (312.0 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash (1.2 ) (3.1 ) 1.8 Cash (used for) provided by continuing operations $ (48.9 ) $ (37.6 ) $ 221.5 The following table summarizes free cash flow (in millions): Cash provided by operating activities $ 426.2 $ 638.9 $ 596.9 Excess income tax benefit from stock option exercises 47.4 Capital expenditures (150.1 ) (124.1 ) (98.0 ) Free cash flow $ 323.5 $ 514.8 $ 498.9 Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investment required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. In the first quarter of 2006, we adopted SFAS 123(R) (see Note 1 in the Financial Statements), which requires that we report excess tax benefits related to share based compensation as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We have added this benefit back to our operating cash flow to present free cash flow on a basis that is consistent with our historical presentation. In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may differ from definitions used by other companies. Free cash flow was $323.5 million for the year ended September 30, 2006 compared to $514.8 million for the year ended September 30, 2005. Free cash flow in 2006 includes voluntary contributions to our U.S. pension plan of $450.0 million compared to $150.0 million of such contributions in 2005. In addition, increased capital spending and working capital in 2006 resulted from the operating growth and growth investments that occurred during the year. Commercial paper is our principal source of short term financing. Commercial paper borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2006 were $219.0 million. The weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was 5.4 percent. At September 30, 2005, and throughout 2005, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding due to our cash position. In October 2005, we contributed $450 million to our U.S. qualified pension trust. We funded the contribution with a combination of cash on hand and $300 million of commercial paper borrowings. In November 2005, we sold 24 owned properties in a sale leaseback transaction for net cash proceeds of approximately $147.5 million. We used the cash proceeds to repay commercial paper borrowings. In September of 2006 we received $83.4 million of cash from the sale of our investment in RSC. In 2006, we repurchased approximately 12.2 million shares of our common stock of which 0.4 million shares did not settle until October 2006. The total cost of these shares was $743.1 million, of which $20.6 million was recorded in accounts payable at September 30, 2006. We repurchased 9.8 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $499.2 million in 2005. We anticipate repurchasing stock in 2007, the amount of which will depend ultimately on business conditions, stock price and other cash requirements. At September 30, 2006 we had authorization from our Board of Directors to purchase up to approximately 5.6 million additional shares through September 30, 2007. On November 7, 2006, we announced that we have entered into a definitive agreement to divest the principal businesses included in our Power Systems operating segment for $1.8 billion, comprised of $1.75 billion in cash and $50 million in common stock of the acquirer. The divestiture is subject to customary closing conditions and regulatory approval and is expected to close in our second fiscal quarter. We expect to use a significant portion of the after tax cash proceeds to repurchase common stock, to pay down outstanding commercial paper balances, or to pursue growth opportunities. 24 We expect future significant uses of cash to include repurchases of common stock, repayments of short term borrowings, dividends to shareowners, capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses and may include additional contributions to our pension plans. We expect capital expenditures in 2007 to be about $175 million. We expect to fund each of these future uses of cash with existing cash balances, cash generated by operating activities, commercial paper borrowings, divestures of businesses, a new issue of debt or issuance of other securities. In addition to cash generated by operating activities, we have access to existing financing sources, including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks. Our debt to total capital ratio was 33.5 percent at September 30, 2006 and 31.2 percent at September 30, 2005. In October 2004, we entered into a five year $600.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility that replaced our then existing $675.0 million unsecured credit facilities. In September 2006 we entered into a 364 day $250.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Both credit facilities remain in effect and we had not drawn down under either of them at September 30, 2006 or 2005. Borrowings under these credit facilities bear interest based on short term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding. The terms of these credit facilities contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debt to total capital ratio was to exceed 60 percent. We were in compliance with all covenants under these credit facilities at September 30, 2006 and 2005. In addition to our $600.0 million and $250.0 million credit facilities, short term unsecured credit facilities of approximately $125.2 million at September 30, 2006 were available to foreign subsidiaries. The following is a summary of our credit ratings as of September 30, 2006: Credit Rating Agency Short Term Rating Long Term Rating Outlook Standard Poors A 1 A Stable Moodys P 2 A3 Positive Fitch Ratings F1 A Stable Among other uses, we can draw our credit facilities as standby liquidity facilities to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures. This access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the ratings set forth in the table above that have been given to our commercial paper. Under our current policy with respect to these ratings, we expect to limit our other borrowings under the credit facilities, if any, to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facilities so that we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures. If our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and the unsecured committed credit facilities to provide short term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings. Cash dividends to shareowners were $159.3 million ($0.90 per share) in 2006 and $142.7 million ($0.78 per share) in 2005. Although declaration and payment of dividends are at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, we expect to pay quarterly dividends in 2007 of $0.29 per outstanding share.

Therefore, changes in currency rates affect our reported sales. We believe that sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates, which is a non GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates. We use sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates to monitor and evaluate our regional performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective periods sales using the same currency exchange rates as were in effect in the preceding year. We attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination. The following is a reconciliation of our reported sales to sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates (in millions): Year Ended September 30, 2006 Year Ended September 30, 2005 Sales Sales Excluding Excluding the Effect the Effect of Changes of Changes in Currency in Currency Currency Exchange Currency Exchange Sales Translation Rates Sales Translation Rates U.S. and Canada $ 3,827.1 $ (31.5 ) $ 3,795.6 $ 3,420.6 $ (32.0 ) $ 3,388.6 Europe, Middle East and Africa 856.5 25.7 882.2 821.3 (35.6 ) 785.7 Asia Pacific 573.1 0.3 573.4 518.7 (21.2 ) 497.5 Latin America 304.7 (14.8 ) 289.9 242.6 (11.6 ) 231.0 Total Company Sales $ 5,561.4 $ (20.3 ) $ 5,541.1 $ 5,003.2 $ (100.4 ) $ 4,902.8 The following is a reconciliation of reported sales of our Control Systems segment to sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates (in millions): Year Ended September 30, 2006 Year Ended September 30, 2005 Sales Sales Excluding Excluding the Effect the Effect of Changes of Changes in Currency in Currency Currency Exchange Currency Exchange Sales Translation Rates Sales Translation Rates U.S. and Canada $ 2,923.6 $ (28.0 ) $ 2,895.6 $ 2,619.4 $ (28.4 ) $ 2,591.0 Europe, Middle East and Africa 834.4 25.8 860.2 807.4 (35.3 ) 772.1 Asia Pacific 521.8 1.2 523.0 480.4 (20.9 ) 459.5 Latin America 271.5 (14.4 ) 257.1 216.4 (11.5 ) 204.9 Total Control Systems Sales $ 4,551.3 $ (15.4 ) $ 4,535.9 $ 4,123.6 $ (96.1 ) $ 4,027.5 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management. 26 Retirement Benefits Pension Benefits Pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts, including the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, the assumed annual compensation increase rate, the retirement rate, the mortality rate and the employee turnover rate. Changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense recognized in future periods. Our global pension expense in 2006 was $83.6 million compared to $66.2 million in 2005. Approximately 70 percent of our 2006 global pension expense relates to our U.S. qualified pension plan. The actuarial assumptions used to determine our 2006 U.S. pension expense included the following: discount rate of 5.25 percent (compared to 6.25 percent for 2005); expected rate of return on plan assets of 8.50 percent (compared to 8.50 percent for 2005); and an assumed compensation increase rate of 4.06 percent (compared to 4.50 percent for 2005). In 2006, we made voluntary contributions of $450.0 million to our primary U.S. qualified pension plan trust compared to $150.0 million in 2005. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law in August 2006. We are currently evaluating this legislation and the effect it will have on our future pension contributions. We estimate our pension expense will be approximately $46 million in 2007, a decrease of approximately $37 million from 2006. Our estimated 2007 pension expense reflects the net cost related to changes in actuarial assumptions in the U.S. pension plan and the benefit of the $450.0 million contribution in October 2005. For 2007, changes in actuarial assumptions include an increase in our discount rate to 6.50 percent from the 5.25 percent rate used in 2006. The discount rate is set as of our June 30th measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans. Our assumed rate of return on plan assets will be reduced to 8.00 percent, compared to the 8.50 percent assumed rate of return used in 2006. We considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term as well as the current and expected mix of plan investments in setting this assumption. We intend, over time, to change the U.S. plans mix of investments by increasing the weighting in debt securities. We have assumed a compensation increase rate of 4.19 percent in 2007 compared to 4.06 percent used in 2006. We established this rate using an analysis of all elements of employee compensation that are considered pension eligible earnings. The following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the assumptions for our U.S. pension plans (in millions): Pension Benefits Change in Change in Projected Benefit Net Periodic Benefit Obligation Cost Discount Rate $ 62.0 $ 7.2 Rate of Return 4.5 Additional information regarding pension benefits, including our pension obligation and minimum pension liability adjustment, is contained in Note 12 in the Financial Statements. Other Postretirement Benefits We estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits other than pensions using assumptions, including the discount rate and, for plans other than our primary U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit program, expected trends in the cost for healthcare services. Changes in these assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods. The discount rate used to calculate our 2006 other postretirement benefits expense was 5.00 percent (compared to 6.25 percent in 2005). For 2007, the discount rate assumption for other postretirement benefit expense will increase to 6.50 percent. The discount rate is set as of our June 30th measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans. 27 Effective October 1, 2002, we amended our primary U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit program in order to mitigate our share of the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare services. As a result of this amendment to our primary U.S. program, there is no increase in healthcare costs resulting from healthcare inflationary trends as of January 1, 2005. Net periodic benefit cost in 2006 was $35.4 million compared to $24.9 million in 2005. We expect net periodic benefit cost in 2007 of approximately $13 million and the estimated postretirement projected benefit obligation to approximate $255 million. The decreases are due primarily to the increase in the discount rate by 150 basis points to 6.50 percent and our transition of all eligible retirees to a more efficient Medicare Advantage Plan. Additional information regarding postretirement benefits is contained in Note 12 in the Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition We record sales of products and services, representing approximately 90 percent of our consolidated sales, when all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists; pricing is fixed or determinable; collection is reasonably assured; and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred, as may be required according to contract terms, or services have been rendered. We recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as construction type contracts using either the percentage of completion or completed contract methods of accounting. We record sales relating to these contracts using the percentage of completion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable; we use the completed contract method for all others. Under the percentage of completion method, we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using either (i) the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion or (ii) units of delivery. Under the percentage of completion method, we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified. We record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified. We use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale. We use shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis, as well as the customers payment history. Returns, Rebates and Incentives Our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the end user or original equipment manufacturing (OEM) customer to whom our distributor ultimately sells the product. We also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates, account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria. Certain distributors are offered a right to return product, subject to contractual limitations. We record accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience. Adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns, rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual. A critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed. If the time period were to change by 10 percent, the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately $6.0 million. Returns, rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits. Rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided. Accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or, where a right of set off exists, as a reduction of accounts receivable. The accrual for customer returns, rebates and incentives was $121.8 million at September 30, 2006 and $117.6 million at September 30, 2005, of which $8.5 million at September 30, 2006 and $9.4 million at September 30, 2005 was included as an offset to accounts receivable. 28 Impairment of Long Lived Assets We evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be fully recoverable through future cash flows. We evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. We use judgment when applying the impairment rules to determine when an impairment test is necessary. Factors we consider that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to historical or forecasted operating results, a significant decrease in the market value of an asset, a significant change in the extent or manner in which an asset is used and significant negative industry or economic trends. Impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying value of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value. To determine fair value, we must make estimates of the future cash flows related to the asset being reviewed. These estimates require assumptions about demand for our products and services, future market conditions and technological developments. Other assumptions include the discount rate and future growth rates. We perform our annual impairment test on non amortized intangible assets during the second quarter of our fiscal year. As of the second quarter of 2006, the estimated fair value of our Reliance trademark exceeded its $72.8 million net book value. Either an increase in the discount rate or a decrease in planned future growth or profitability of our Electrical business group could result in an impairment charge to write down the book value of the Reliance trademark to the revised estimated fair value. Litigation, Claims and Contingencies We record liabilities for litigation, claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation. We also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures. The liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated and third party sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party. At third party sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. At environmental sites where we are the only responsible party, we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation. We do not discount future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their present value. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup. To the extent that remediation procedures change, additional contamination is identified, or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected, the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change. Effective September 30, 2006, we adopted FIN 47, which clarifies the guidance included in SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS 143). Under FIN 47, companies must accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal operation of the long lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional. Identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities. We estimated conditional asset retirement obligations using site specific knowledge and historical industry expertise. The application of FIN 47 resulted in a charge, net of tax, of $18.1 million included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2006 as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. Our reserve for environmental matters, net of related receivables, was $66.6 million at September 30, 2006 and $39.3 million at September 30, 2005. The reserve in 2006 includes $29.3 million recorded in Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at September 30, 2006 resulting from our adoption of FIN 47; see Note 17 in the Financial Statements for additional information. During 2006, we recorded adjustments totaling $5.2 million, excluding the adoption of FIN 47, to increase the environmental reserves related to several legacy sites compared to 2005 adjustments of $8.5 million. 29 Our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses formerly owned by us (legacy businesses) for which we retained the responsibility to remediate. The nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low. As a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters, we expect that gradually, over a long period of time, our environmental obligations will decline. However, changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations. Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product liability. As described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago. See Item 3 for further discussion. Our principal self insurance programs include product liability where we are self insured up to a specified dollar amount. Claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies purchased from commercial insurers. We estimate the reserve for product liability claims, excluding asbestos, using our claims experience for the periods being valued. Adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims. The reserve for product liability claims was $29.7 million at September 30, 2006 and $29.5 million at September 30, 2005. Additional information regarding litigation, claims and contingencies is contained in Note 17 in the Financial Statements. Income Taxes We operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by various U.S. Federal, state and foreign jurisdictions for various tax periods. Additionally, we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years. Our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction, the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. While we have support for the positions taken on our tax returns, taxing authorities are increasingly asserting interpretations of laws and facts and challenging cross jurisdictional transactions. Cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products, services, and or intellectual property as well as various U.S. state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures. We regularly assess our position with regard to tax exposures and record liabilities for uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties, if any, according to the principles of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies. We have recorded an accrual of $85.1 million at September 30, 2006 and $103.1 million at September 30, 2005 that reflects our estimate of the likely outcome of current and future audits, which is included in Other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A final determination of these tax audits or changes in our estimates may result in additional future income tax expense or benefit. We have recorded a valuation allowance for the majority of our deferred tax assets in the amount of $36.8 million at September 30, 2006 and $55.5 million at September 30, 2005 related to non U.S. net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards (Carryforwards) based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction. The valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty that the Carryforward amount will be realized. Our income would increase if we determine we will be able to utilize more Carryforwards than currently expected. At the end of each interim reporting period, we estimate a base effective tax rate, which is the effective tax rate that we expect for the full fiscal year based on our most recent forecast of pretax income, permanent book and tax differences and global tax planning strategies. We use this base rate to provide for income taxes on a year to date basis, excluding the effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items or items that are reported net of their related tax effects. We recognize the tax effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items in the period in which they are realizable. Additional information regarding income taxes is contained in Note 16 in the Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 in the Financial Statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements. 30 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Interest Rate Risk In addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities, we use a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations. We are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations. Our short term debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings. At September 30, 2006, we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $219.0 million at a weighted average interest rate of 5.4 percent; we had no commercial paper or significant bank borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2005 or during 2005. The weighted average interest rate on the 2006 commercial paper borrowings was 4.8 percent. Changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations. In 2006 and 2005, a 10 percent increase in average market interest rates would not have had a significant effect on our results of operations. At September 30, 2006 we had $219.0 million of unsecured commercial paper obligations outstanding with maturities of three days. As these obligations mature, we issued, and anticipate continuing to issue, additional short term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. We had outstanding fixed rate long term debt obligations with carrying values of $748.2 million at September 30, 2006 and $748.2 million at September 30, 2005. The fair value of this debt was $804.2 million at September 30, 2006 and $826.2 million at September 30, 2005. The potential reduction in fair value on such fixed rate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt. We currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed rate instruments and, therefore, fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners equity. In September 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap contract that effectively converted our $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.15% notes, payable in 2008, to floating rate debt based on six month LIBOR. The floating rate was 8.02 percent at September 30, 2006. A hypothetical 10 percent change in market interest rates would not be significant to the overall fair value of the swap or our results of operations. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage our exposure on transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency. In addition, we enter into contracts to hedge certain forecasted intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next three years. Contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. We do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to United States dollars. A 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings. For derivatives that are hedges, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We recognize the ineffective portion of a derivatives change in fair value in earnings immediately. At September 30, 2006 and 2005, we had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts relating to the euro, British pound sterling, South Korean won and Swiss franc. The use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations. 31 The following table indicates the total U.S. dollar equivalents of net transactional foreign exchange exposure related to (short) long contracts outstanding by currency: September 30, 2006 2005 Euro $ (399.8 ) $ (482.0 ) British pound (35.7 ) (42.7 ) South Korean won (21.5 ) (19.0 ) Swiss franc 12.7 46.0 Other 1.5 10.3 Total $ (442.8 ) $ (487.4 ) All of the contracts included in the table above will have offsetting effects from actual transactions that have occurred or will occur in the future. We designated certain of these contracts related to intercompany transactions forecasted to occur through November 2009 as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The remaining foreign exchange contracts offset actual underlying receivables and payables in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 32
