Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Results of Operations Non GAAP Measures The following discussion includes organic sales and free cash flow, which are non GAAP measures. See Supplemental Sales Information for a reconciliation of reported sales to organic sales in addition to a discussion of why we believe this non GAAP measure is useful to investors. See Financial Condition for a reconciliation of cash flows from operating activities to free cash flow and a discussion of why we believe this non GAAP measure is useful to investors. Overview We are a leading global provider of industrial automation power, control and information products and services. Overall demand for our products and services is driven by: investments in manufacturing capacity, including upgrades, modifications, and expansions of existing manufacturing facilities, and the creation of new manufacturing facilities; our customers needs for greater productivity, cost reduction, quality, safety and overall global competitiveness; industry factors that include our customers new product introductions, trends in the actual and forecasted demand for our customers products or services, and the regulatory and competitive environments in which our customers operate; levels of global industrial production; regional factors that include local political, social, regulatory and economic circumstances; and the seasonal capital spending patterns of our customers due to their annual capital budgeting processes and their working schedules. U. S. Industrial Economic Trends In 2007, sales to U.S. customers accounted for 54 percent of our total sales. The various indicators we use to gauge the direction and momentum of our served U.S. markets include: Industrial Equipment Spending is an economic statistic compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This statistic provides insight into spending trends in the broad U.S. industrial economy. Global Insights uses this statistic along with other economic indicators to forecast industrial equipment spending. These measures over the longer term have proven to have reasonable predictive value as a directional indicator of our domestic growth. Capacity Utilization, which is an indication of plant operating activity published by the Federal Reserve. Historically there has been a meaningful correlation between Capacity Utilization and the level of capital investment made by our U.S. customers in their manufacturing base. The Manufacturing Purchasing Managers Index (PMI), published by the Institute for Supply Management (ISM), which is an indication of the current and near term state of manufacturing activity in the U.S. According to the ISM, a PMI measure above 50 indicates that the U.S. manufacturing economy is generally expanding while a measure below 50 indicates that it is generally contracting. 16 The table below depicts the continued general gradual improvement in U.S. Industrial Equipment Spending since December 2004. Capacity Utilization has remained above 80 percent since December 2005 while the PMI has sustained a rate over 50 since December 2004. Although we have seen consistent strength over the past few years in the manufacturing indicators we follow, we are seeing a deceleration in the rate of manufacturing growth in the North American market.

Non U.S. Regional Trends In 2007, sales to non U.S. customers accounted for 46 percent of our total sales. Outside the U.S., demand for our products and services is principally driven by the strength of the industrial economy in each region and by our customers ability and propensity to invest in their manufacturing assets. These customers may include both multinational companies with expanding global presence and a growing number of local companies. Recent strength in demand for our products and services has, in part, been driven by investments in infrastructure in developing economies, investments in basic materials production capacity in response to higher commodity pricing and expanding consumer markets. We continued to see strong demand in China, India and Latin America during 2007. We also saw considerable growth in Europe during 2007, as we benefited from our targeted growth investments in customer facing resources and improving macro economic conditions. We expect strong growth in Latin America, Europe and the emerging economies in Asia Pacific to continue into 2008. 17 Revenue by Geographic Region The table below presents our actual sales for the year ended September 30, 2007 by geographic region and the change in sales from the year ended September 30, 2006 (in millions, except percentages): Year EndedSeptember 30, 2007(1) Change vs. Year EndedSeptember 30, 2006 Change in Organic Sales vs. Year EndedSeptember 30, 2006(2) United States $ 2,687.0 3% 3% Canada 341.1 3% (1%) Europe, Middle East and Africa 1,054.2 27% 14% Asia Pacific 588.8 13% 7% Latin America 332.8 23% 19% Total sales $ 5,003.9 10% 6% (1) We attribute sales to the geographic regions based upon country of destination. (2) Organic sales are sales excluding the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions. See Supplemental Sales Information for information on this non GAAP measure. Industry Views We serve customers in a wide range of industries, including consumer, resource based and transportation. Our consumer industry customers are engaged in the food and beverage, home and personal care, and life sciences industries. These customers needs include global expansion, incremental capacity from existing facilities, an increasingly flexible manufacturing environment and regulatory compliance. In addition, these customers operate in an environment where product innovation and time to market are critical factors. Consumer products customers capital investments are generally less cyclical than those of resource based customers. Our customers in resource based industries, including oil and gas, mining, aggregates, metals, water/wastewater, forest products and cement, all benefit from higher commodity prices and higher global demand for basic materials, both of which encourage investment in capacity and productivity in these industries. Higher energy prices have historically caused customers across all industries to consider investing in more energy efficient manufacturing processes and technologies, such as intelligent motor controls. In transportation, factors such as excess capacity, geographic expansion, investment in new model introductions and more flexible manufacturing technologies affect our sales. Outlook for 2008 The following is a summary of our key objectives for 2008: continue to grow profitably and diversify our business, by aggressively pursuing growth in an expanded addressable market and enhancing our market access both organically and through synergistic acquisitions; execute our cost productivity initiatives; expand our global business footprint with a focus on production efficiencies and enhanced customer experience; remain focused on our ERP system implementation across the globe with minimal disruption to our business and clients; and sustain the growth of our integrated control and information architecture by accelerating the proliferation and adoption rate and enhancing features and functionality. 18 Our outlook for 2008 is based on anticipated strength in customer demand in Europe and emerging markets. We believe our investments in technology leadership, expanded served markets and stronger global presence are creating more worldwide opportunities for growth than ever before, despite a deceleration in the rate of manufacturing growth in the North American market. This ongoing diversification of our revenue base, combined with our recent acquisitions, cause us to be optimistic that 2008 will be another good year. We remain intensely focused on executing our growth and productivity initiatives as we continue to evolve our global footprint, not just in manufacturing, but in engineering, back office and customer support infrastructure. As of the date of filing this report, based upon current economic conditions and business trends, we expect revenue to grow by 10 to 12 percent in 2008. We anticipate acquisitions will contribute approximately 3 percentage points to this growth rate and that our services and solutions business will continue to become a larger portion of our revenue. We also believe that we will continue to benefit from the strong momentum in our growth initiatives, particularly process applications and safety. We expect continued growth from the commercial investments we have made in EMEA and Latin America, continued strength in emerging markets and improved performance in the Asia Pacific region, especially China, offset by somewhat slower rates of growth in developed economies. As of the date hereof, we also expect 2008 diluted earnings per share to be in the range of $4.25 to $4.45. This includes an expected effective income tax rate that will average about 28 to 29 percent for the full year, subject to quarterly variability. We anticipate an earnings benefit from volume leverage, productivity initiatives and a decrease in our year over year average share count. These items will be partially offset by our investments in new products, services, technologies and expertise to serve new applications and markets, combined with inflation in material and employee costs and the globalization of our business model. We also expect acquisitions will put downward pressure on operating margin and that, combined with purchase accounting expense, will have a negative impact on diluted earnings per share. We also plan to generate free cash flow of approximately 95 percent of net income in 2008. 19 Summary of Results of Operations Year Ended September 30, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Sales Architecture & Software $ 2,221.3 $ 2,059.2 $ 1,917.7 Control Products & Solutions 2,782.6 2,497.2 2,193.8 Total $ 5,003.9 $ 4,556.4 $ 4,111.5 Segment operating earnings(a) Architecture & Software $ 587.7 $ 533.9 $ 517.0 Control Products & Solutions 397.0 339.9 237.2 Purchase accounting depreciation and amortization (16.4 ) (10.6 ) (10.0 ) General corporate net (72.8 ) (90.7 ) (68.5 ) Special charges(b) (43.5 ) Interest expense (63.4 ) (56.6 ) (45.8 ) Gain on sale of investment(c) 19.9 Income from continuing operations before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change 788.6 735.8 629.9 Provision for income taxes (219.3 ) (206.5 ) (182.2 ) Income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change 569.3 529.3 447.7 Income from discontinued operations(d) 918.5 95.4 92.3 Cumulative effect of accounting change(e) (17.7 ) Net income $ 1,487.8 $ 607.0 $ 540.0 Diluted earnings per share: Continuing operations $ 3.53 $ 2.94 $ 2.39 Discontinued operations 5.70 0.53 0.49 Cumulative effect of accounting change (0.10 ) Net income $ 9.23 $ 3.37 $ 2.88 Diluted weighted average outstanding shares 161.2 179.9 187.2 (a) Information regarding how we define segment operating earnings is included in Note 18 in the Financial Statements. (b) Amount in 2007 represents costs ($27.7 million after tax, or $0.17 per diluted share) related to various restructuring activities designed to execute on our cost productivity initiatives and to advance our globalization strategy. See Note 14 in the Financial Statements for more information. (c) Amount in 2006 represents a gain on sale ($12.0 million after tax, or $0.07 per diluted share) related to the sale of our 50 percent interest in RSC. See Note 2 in the Financial Statements for more information. (d) See Note 13 in the Financial Statements for a description of items reported as discontinued operations. (e) Effective September 30, 2006, we adopted FIN 47, resulting in a charge of $28.6 million ($17.7 million after tax, or $0.10 per diluted share). See Note 17 in the Financial Statements for more information. 20 2007 Compared to 2006 (in millions, except per share amounts) 2007 2006 Change Sales $ 5,003.9 $ 4,556.4 $ 447.5 Income from continuing operations before accounting change 569.3 529.3 40.0 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations before accounting change 3.53 2.94 0.59 Sales Sales increased 10 percent in 2007 compared to 2006. Organic sales increased 6 percent, as foreign currency translation and acquisitions added 3 and 1 percentage points to the growth rate, respectively. Sales in the United States increased 3 percent in 2007 compared to 2006. Full year sales were strong in Europe and Latin America, as organic growth rates were 14 percent and 19 percent, respectively. Asia Pacific sales grew organically by 7 percent over 2006, while Canada reported a 1 percent decline in organic growth. We continued to see our growth investments in EMEA, Latin America and in the life sciences industry deliver incremental revenue. These increases were partially offset by a sales decline in the North American automotive industry due to weakness in our important Detroit customer base. General Corporate Net General corporate expenses were $72.8 million in 2007 compared to $90.7 million in 2006. The decrease is due primarily to interest income on the proceeds of the Power Systems sale. Expenses during 2007 also include charges of $13.9 million related to environmental remediation costs at legacy sites, partially offset by a $12.1 million dividend related to an equity interest we acquired as a result of the divestiture of our FirstPoint Contact business. Special Charges Special charges of $43.5 million include costs related to various restructuring actions designed to execute on our cost productivity initiatives and to advance our globalization strategy. Actions included workforce reductions, realignment of administrative functions and rationalization and consolidation of global operations. We expect total cash expenditures to approximate $39.0 million in connection with these actions, of which we paid $5.3 million through September 30, 2007. Non cash special charges include write downs of certain inventory, machinery and equipment totaling $4.5 million. Interest Expense Interest expense was $63.4 million in 2007 compared to $56.6 million in 2006. The increase was due to higher average commercial paper borrowings in 2007 as well as higher interest rates associated with our interest rate swap (see Note 6 in the Financial Statements). Income Taxes The effective tax rate for 2007 was 27.8 percent compared to 28.1 percent in 2006. The 2007 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 percent because we benefited from lower non U.S. tax rates, resolved certain tax matters and claims related to the closure of the 2005 U.S. federal audit cycle and various state tax audits and made other provision adjustments. The 2006 effective tax rate was lower than the federal statutory rate of 35 percent because we reversed $27.2 million ($0.15 per diluted share) of valuation allowances on capital loss carryforwards, settled audit matters with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for the years 2003 and 2004, benefited from lower tax rates outside the U.S., received Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC) and Extra Territorial Income (ETI) tax benefits and made other provision adjustments. 21 See Note 16 in the Financial Statements for a complete reconciliation of the United States statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate and more information on tax events in 2007 and 2006 affecting the respective tax rates. Income from Continuing Operations before Accounting Change Income from continuing operations in 2007 increased 8 percent from 2006. The increase is due primarily to increased sales, lower retirement benefits expense, improved operating margins and increased dividend and interest income, partially offset by special charges, additional environmental charges and higher interest expense. Discontinued Operations Amounts reported for discontinued operations primarily relate to the operating results of the principal businesses of our former Power Systems operating segment for periods before the divestiture and the gain on sale of the principal businesses of our former Power Systems operating segment. Net income on operating activities of Power Systems was $42.3 million in 2007 and $100.1 million in 2006. We reported an after tax gain on the sale of Power Systems of $868.2 million ($5.39 per share) in 2007. We also reported after tax income of $8.0 million during 2007 related to other discontinued operations activities, compared to a $4.7 million loss from other discontinued operations activities in 2006. See also Note 13 in the Financial Statements for more information on discontinued operations. Architecture & Software (in millions, except percentages) 2007 2006 Change Sales $ 2,221.3 $ 2,059.2 $ 162.1 Segment operating earnings 587.7 533.9 53.8 Segment operating margin 26.5 % 25.9 % 0.6pts Sales Architecture & Software sales increased 8 percent compared to 2006. Organic growth accounted for 5 percent of the increase, as foreign currency translation added 3 percentage points to the growth rate. We continued to see growth in process applications, safety and the CompactLogix product offering. Operating Margin Segment operating margin increased by 0.6 points in 2007 compared to 2006 due to the successful execution of our productivity initiatives, price increases and lower retirement benefits expense, partially offset by inflation and spending to support growth. Control Products & Solutions (in millions, except percentages) 2007 2006 Change Sales $ 2,782.6 $ 2,497.2 $ 285.4 Segment operating earnings 397.0 339.9 57.1 Segment operating margin 14.3 % 13.6 % 0.7pts Sales Control Products & Solutions sales increased 11 percent compared to 2006. Organic growth contributed 7 percent of the increase, as foreign currency translation and acquisitions added 4 percentage points to the growth rate. Year over year results benefited from strong growth in our power centric and solutions businesses. 22 Operating Margin Segment operating margin increased 0.7 points in 2007 compared to 2006 due to productivity efforts, price increases and lower retirement benefits expense, partially offset by inflation and spending to support growth. 2006 Compared to 2005 (in millions, except per share amounts) 2006 2005 Change Sales $ 4,556.4 $ 4,111.5 $ 444.9 Income from continuing operations before accounting change 529.3 447.7 81.6 Diluted earnings per share from continuing operations before accounting change 2.94 2.39 0.55 Sales Sales increased 11 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 with growth in both our Architecture & Software and Control Products & Solutions segments. Total sales were not significantly affected year over year by changes in currency exchange rates. Organic sales in the U.S. and Canada increased by 11 percent in 2006 compared to 2005, despite being negatively impacted by the weakness in the North American automotive market in the second half of the year. Organic sales in the Asia Pacific region grew by 9 percent in 2006 compared to 2005 with particularly strong growth in the emerging economies, including China and India. Latin America organic sales grew by 19 percent in 2006 compared to 2005, led by strength in the oil and gas and mining industries. Organic sales in Europe grew by 7 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Europe experienced considerable growth during the second half of 2006. Our operations in Europe benefited from our investment in customer facing resources and improving macro economic conditions. General Corporate Net General corporate expenses were $90.7 million in 2006 compared to $68.5 million in 2005. The increase includes $9.7 million of stock compensation expense, lower interest income and higher contributions to the Rockwell Automation Charitable Corporation. Interest Expense Interest expense was $56.6 million in 2006 compared to $45.8 million in 2005. The increase was due to our commercial paper borrowings during 2006, as well as higher interest rates associated with our interest rate swap (see Note 6 in the Financial Statements). Income Taxes The effective tax rate for 2006 was 28.1 percent compared to 28.9 percent in 2005. The 2006 effective tax rate differed from the federal statutory rate of 35 percent due to the reversal of $27.2 million ($0.15 per diluted share) of valuation allowances on capital loss carryforwards, settlement of audit matters with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for the years 2003 and 2004, lower non U.S. tax rates, FSC and ETI tax benefits and other provision adjustments. The effective tax rate for 2005 was lower than the federal statutory tax rate of 35 percent due to a benefit of $19.3 million ($0.10 per diluted share) related to the settlement of audit matters with the U.S. Internal Revenue Service for the years 1998 through 2002, utilization of foreign tax credits, FSC and ETI tax benefits and other provision adjustments. See Note 16 in the Financial Statements for a complete reconciliation of the United States statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate and more information on tax events in 2006 and 2005 affecting the respective tax rates. 23 Income from Continuing Operations before Accounting Change Income from continuing operations before accounting change increased 18 percent to $529.3 million, compared to 2005. The increase is due to higher volume, productivity programs, favorable pricing and a slightly lower effective tax rate, partially offset by inflation and higher growth initiative spending in comparison to the prior year. Income from continuing operations before accounting change includes $16.7 million (after tax) of share based compensation expense due to the adoption of a new accounting standard, SFAS 123(R), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)). Additionally, 2006 results include $13.4 million (after tax) of increased pension and retiree medical expense, lower interest income, higher charitable contributions, and higher interest expense compared to 2005. Income from continuing operations before accounting change in 2005 includes an after tax benefit of $8.4 million related to an insurance settlement and an after tax charge of $11.1 million related to restructuring activities in Europe. Discontinued Operations Amounts reported for discontinued operations primarily relate to the results of our former Power Systems operating segment. Power Systems sales in 2006 were $989.2 million, an increase of 15 percent compared to $860.7 million in 2005, due to growth in both our Dodge mechanical and Reliance electrical business groups. Sales at Power Systems benefited from continued strong momentum resulting from high energy and commodity prices. These higher prices resulted in the businesses predominantly U.S. based customers continuing to invest in capacity expansion after several years of under investment and reduced capital spending. Power Systems net income was $100.1 million, an increase of 41 percent compared to $70.8 million in 2005 due to higher volume, productivity initiatives, a balanced dynamic between price and cost, and lower restructuring costs, somewhat offset by inflation. Net income in 2006 includes share based compensation expense of $2.5 million and increased pension and retiree medical expense of $3.5 million compared to 2005. Net income in 2005 includes a charge of $3.1 million associated with a facility closure and the corresponding write down of property to its fair value. Discontinued operations in 2006 also includes charges related to our former aerospace and defense businesses operation of the Rocky Flats facility, the loss on our sale of the ElectroCraft business, and ElectroCrafts loss from operations. Discontinued operations in 2005 includes tax matters and ElectroCrafts loss from operations. See Note 13 in the Financial Statements for more information regarding Discontinued Operations. Architecture & Software (in millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 Change Sales $ 2,059.2 $ 1,917.7 $ 141.5 Segment operating earnings 533.9 517.0 16.9 Segment operating margin 25.9 % 27.0 % (1.1)pts Sales Architecture & Software sales increased 7 percent in 2006 compared to 2005. Our Logix platform business grew about 20 percent, despite the slowdown in sales to our traditional North American automotive market during the second half of the year. Operating Margin Segment operating margin fell by 1.1 points due to higher employee expenses, inflation and higher growth initiative spending in comparison to the prior year, partially offset by higher volume, productivity programs, favorable pricing, and lower restructuring costs. Segment operating earnings in 2006 include $7.0 million of stock compensation expense due to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Additionally, 2006 results include $7.8 million 24 of increased pension and retiree medical expense compared to 2005. Segment operating earnings in 2005 include a benefit of $5.6 million related to an insurance settlement and a charge of $6.3 million related to restructuring activities in Europe. Control Products & Solutions (in millions, except percentages) 2006 2005 Change Sales $ 2,497.2 $ 2,193.8 $ 303.4 Segment operating earnings 339.9 237.2 102.7 Segment operating margin 13.6 % 10.8 % 2.8pts Sales Control Products & Solutions sales increased 14 percent due to growth in both our control products and our solutions businesses. This growth benefited from the strength of our power centric businesses. Operating Margin Segment operating margin increased by 2.8 points due to higher volume, productivity programs, favorable pricing and lower restructuring costs, partially offset by higher employee expenses, inflation and higher growth initiative spending in comparison to the prior year. Segment operating earnings in 2006 include $8.8 million of stock compensation expense due to the adoption of SFAS 123(R). Additionally, 2006 results include $13.7 million of increased pension and retiree medical expense compared to 2005. Segment operating earnings in 2005 include a benefit of $6.7 million related to an insurance settlement and a charge of $10.2 million related to restructuring activities in Europe. Financial Condition The following is a summary of our cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows (in millions): Year Ended September 30, 2007 2006 2005 Cash provided by (used for): Operating activities $ 444.9 $ 313.3 $ 548.3 Investing activities 1,398.9 52.7 (96.3 ) Financing activities (1,673.1 ) (556.1 ) (551.7 ) Effect of exchange rate changes on cash 38.8 (1.2 ) (3.1 ) Cash provided by (used for) continuing operations $ 209.5 $ (191.3 ) $ (102.8 ) The following table summarizes free cash flow (in millions): Cash provided by continuing operating activities $ 444.9 $ 313.3 $ 548.3 Capital expenditures of continuing operations (131.0 ) (122.3 ) (102.7 ) Tax payments related to the gain on divestiture of Power Systems 190.0 Excess income tax benefit from stock option exercises 27.1 47.4 Free cash flow $ 531.0 $ 238.4 $ 445.6 Our definition of free cash flow, which is a non GAAP financial measure, takes into consideration capital investments required to maintain the operations of our businesses and execute our strategy. In the first quarter of 2006 we adopted SFAS 123(R) (see Note 11 in the Financial Statements), which requires that we report the excess income tax benefit from the exercise of stock options as a financing cash flow rather than as an operating cash flow. We have added this benefit back to our calculation of free cash flow in order to generally classify cash 25 flows arising from income taxes as operating cash flows. In our opinion, free cash flow provides useful information to investors regarding our ability to generate cash from business operations that is available for acquisitions and other investments, service of debt principal, dividends and share repurchases. We use free cash flow, as defined, as one measure to monitor and evaluate performance. Our definition of free cash flow may be different from definitions used by other companies. Our definition of free cash flow excludes the operating cash flows and capital expenditures related to our discontinued operations. Operating, investing and financing cash flows of our discontinued operations are presented separately in our statement of cash flows. Cash flows from the operating activities of our discontinued operations are reported in our statement of cash flows net of their separately calculated income tax effects. U.S. Federal and state income taxes paid as a result of the gain on sale of the principal businesses of our former Power Systems operating segment have been classified within continuing operations consistent with the cash proceeds. These taxes paid in 2007 have been excluded from free cash flow to present free cash flow that is representative of the performance of our continuing businesses. Free cash flow was $531.0 million for the year ended September 30, 2007 compared to $238.4 million for the year ended September 30, 2006. The increase in free cash flow was largely the result of the $450.0 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. qualified pension plan trust in 2006, compared to $8.0 million of voluntary contributions in 2007. This increase was partially offset by increased working capital requirements during 2007. In January 2007, we received $1.75 billion of cash proceeds from the sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses. We used the cash proceeds to repurchase shares of our common stock to offset the dilutive effect of the divestiture, to pay taxes on the gain on sale and to acquire Industrial Control Services Group Limited (ICS Triplex). In 2007, we repurchased approximately 23.8 million shares of our common stock of which 0.1 million shares did not settle until October 2007. The total cost of these shares was $1,506.1 million, of which $7.5 million was recorded in accounts payable at September 30, 2007. This is compared to purchases of approximately 12.2 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $743.1 million in 2006. Of these purchases, 0.4 million shares amounting to $20.6 million did not settle until October 2006 and were recorded in accounts payable at September 30, 2006. We anticipate repurchasing stock in 2008, the amount of which will depend ultimately on business conditions, stock price and other cash requirements. At September 30, 2007 we had approximately $26.3 million remaining for stock repurchases under an existing board authorization. On November 7, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized us to repurchase up to an additional $1.0 billion of shares of our common stock. We expect future significant uses of cash to include repayments of short term borrowings and the $350.0 million notes due in the second quarter of fiscal 2008, repurchases of common stock, dividends to shareowners, capital expenditures and acquisitions of businesses and may include additional contributions to our pension plans. We expect capital expenditures in 2008 to be about $145 million. We expect to fund these future uses of cash with a combination of existing cash balances, cash generated by operating activities, long term borrowings, commercial paper borrowings or proceeds from the sale of our securities in the capital markets. On November 7, 2007, our Board of Directors authorized us to issue up to $500 million of long term debt. The proceeds of this debt, if issued, primarily would be used to reduce outstanding debt, including retiring the $350 million notes due in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. In addition to cash generated by operating activities, we have access to existing financing sources, including the public debt markets and unsecured credit facilities with various banks. Our debt to total capital ratio was 34.7 percent at September 30, 2007 and 33.5 percent at September 30, 2006. Our debt to total capital ratio at September 30, 2007 was influenced by the adoption of SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) that occurred during 2007. 26 Commercial paper is our principal source of short term financing. Commercial paper borrowings outstanding at September 30, 2007 were $173.0 million. The weighted average interest rate on these borrowings was 5.1 percent. At September 30, 2006, commercial paper borrowings outstanding were $219.0 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 5.4 percent. In October 2004, we entered into a five year $600.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. Our credit facility remains in effect and we had not drawn down under it at September 30, 2007 or 2006. Borrowings under our credit facility bear interest based on short term money market rates in effect during the period the borrowings are outstanding. The terms of our credit facility contain covenants under which we would be in default if our debt to total capital ratio was to exceed 60 percent. We were in compliance with all covenants under our credit facility at September 30, 2007 and 2006. In addition to our $600.0 million credit facility, short term unsecured credit facilities of approximately $172.3 million at September 30, 2007 were available to foreign subsidiaries. In September 2006 we entered into a 364 day $250.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility. We terminated our $250.0 million credit facility effective March 30, 2007, as we no longer considered the liquidity provided by this facility to be necessary. The following is a summary of our credit ratings as of September 30, 2007: Credit Rating Agency Short Term Rating Long Term Rating Outlook Standard & Poors A 1 A Stable Moodys P 1 A2 Stable Fitch Ratings F1 A Stable Among other uses, we can draw our credit facility as a standby liquidity facility to repay our outstanding commercial paper as it matures. This access to funds to repay maturing commercial paper is an important factor in maintaining the ratings set forth in the table above that have been given to our commercial paper. Under our current policy with respect to these ratings, we expect to limit our other borrowings under our credit facility, if any, to amounts that would leave enough credit available under the facility so that we could borrow, if needed, to repay all of our then outstanding commercial paper as it matures. If our access to the commercial paper market is adversely affected due to a change in market conditions or otherwise, we would expect to rely on a combination of available cash and our unsecured committed credit facilities to provide short term funding. In such event, the cost of borrowings under the unsecured committed credit facilities could be higher than the cost of commercial paper borrowings. Cash dividends to shareowners were $184.7 million ($1.16 per share) in 2007, $159.3 million ($0.90 per share) in 2006 and $142.7 million ($0.78 per share) in 2005. Although we declare and pay dividends at the sole discretion of our Board of Directors, we expect to pay quarterly dividends in 2008 of at least $0.29 per outstanding share.

We may make additional contributions to this plan at the discretion of management. (e) This item includes long term obligations under agreements with various service providers. Supplemental Sales Information We translate sales of subsidiaries operating outside of the United States using exchange rates effective during the respective period. Therefore, changes in currency rates affect our reported sales. Sales by businesses we acquired also affect our reported sales. We believe that organic sales, defined as sales excluding the effects of changes in currency exchange rates and acquisitions, which is a non GAAP financial measure, provides useful information to investors because it reflects regional performance from the activities of our businesses without the effect of changes in currency rates or acquisitions made during the period. We use organic sales as one measure to monitor and evaluate our regional performance. We determine the effect of changes in currency exchange rates by translating the respective periods sales using the currency exchange rates that were in effect in the prior year. We determine the effect of acquisitions by excluding sales in the current period for which there are no sales in the comparable prior period. Organic sales growth is calculated by comparing organic sales to reported sales in the prior year. No adjustments have been made to 2006 sales for acquisitions as the effect was not significant. We attribute sales to the geographic regions based on the country of destination. The following is a reconciliation of our reported sales to organic sales (in millions): Year Ended September 30, 2007 Year Ended September 30, 2006 Year EndedSeptember 30,2005 Sales Effect ofChanges inCurrencyandAcquisitions OrganicSales Sales Effect ofChanges inCurrency OrganicSales Sales United States $ 2,687.0 $ (10.3 ) $ 2,676.7 $ 2,599.0 $ (6.6 ) $ 2,592.4 $ 2,308.9 Canada 341.1 (11.2 ) 329.9 332.1 (21.3 ) 310.8 303.5 Europe, Middle East and Africa 1,054.2 (103.9 ) 950.3 832.6 25.8 858.4 804.0 Asia Pacific 588.8 (30.7 ) 558.1 521.4 1.2 522.6 479.8 Latin America 332.8 (10.1 ) 322.7 271.3 (14.5 ) 256.8 215.3 Total Company Sales $ 5,003.9 $ (166.2 )(a) $ 4,837.7 $ 4,556.4 $ (15.4 ) $ 4,541.0 $ 4,111.5 The following is a reconciliation of our reported sales by operating segment to organic sales (in millions): Year Ended September 30, 2007 Year Ended September 30, 2006 Year EndedSeptember 30,2005 Sales Effect ofChanges inCurrencyandAcquisitions OrganicSales Sales Effect ofChanges inCurrency OrganicSales Sales Architecture & Software $ 2,221.3 $ (57.1 ) $ 2,164.2 $ 2,059.2 $ (2.1 ) $ 2,057.1 $ 1,917.7 Control Products & Solutions 2,782.6 (109.1 ) 2,673.5 2,497.2 (13.3 ) 2,483.9 2,193.8 Total Company Sales $ 5,003.9 $ (166.2 )(a) $ 4,837.7 $ 4,556.4 $ (15.4 ) $ 4,541.0 $ 4,111.5 (a) Comprised of $116.6 million related to the effect of changes in currency exchange rates and $49.6 million related to acquisitions. 28 Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We have prepared the consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported. Actual results could differ from those estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies could have the most significant effect on our reported results or require subjective or complex judgments by management. In prior years, we listed impairment of long lived assets as a critical accounting policy and estimate. The most subjective portion of this balance was the Reliance trademark relating to the principal businesses of our former Power Systems operating segment. With the sale of these businesses, including the related trademark, impairment of long lived assets is no longer considered a critical accounting policy and estimate. Retirement Benefits Pension Benefits Pension costs and obligations are actuarially determined and are influenced by assumptions used to estimate these amounts, including the discount rate, the expected rate of return on plan assets, the assumed annual compensation increase rate, the retirement rate, the mortality rate and the employee turnover rate. Changes in any of the assumptions and the amortization of differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of pension expense in future periods. Our global pension expense in 2007 was $46.3 million compared to $71.6 million in 2006. Approximately 57 percent of our 2007 global pension expense relates to our U.S. pension plan. The actuarial assumptions used to determine our 2007 U.S. pension expense included the following: discount rate of 6.50 percent (compared to 5.25 percent for 2006); expected rate of return on plan assets of 8.00 percent (compared to 8.50 percent for 2006); and an assumed compensation increase rate of 4.19 percent (compared to 4.06 percent for 2006). The increase in the U.S. discount rate partially offset by the decrease in the expected rate of return on the U.S. plan assets accounts for the majority of the decline in our global pension expense. In 2007, we made voluntary contributions of $8.0 million to our primary U.S. qualified pension plan trust compared to $450.0 million in 2006. The Pension Protection Act of 2006 was signed into law in August 2006. Interpretive guidance is still evolving. We are currently evaluating this legislation and the effect it will have on our future pension contributions. We estimate our pension expense will be approximately $29.6 million in 2008, a decrease of approximately $16.7 million from 2007. For 2008, our U.S. discount rate will remain at 6.50 percent. The discount rate was set as of our June 30th measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans. Our assumed rate of return on U.S. plan assets will remain at 8.00 percent. We considered actual returns on plan assets over the long term as well as the current and expected mix of plan investments in setting this assumption. We intend, over time, to change the U.S. plans mix of investments by increasing the weighting in debt securities. We have assumed a U.S. compensation increase rate of 4.15 percent in 2008 compared to 4.19 percent used in 2007. We established this rate by analyzing all elements of compensation that are pension eligible earnings. The following chart illustrates the estimated change in benefit obligation and net periodic pension cost assuming a change of 25 basis points in the key assumption for our U.S. pension plans (in millions): Pension Benefits Change inProjected BenefitObligation Change inNet PeriodicBenefit Cost Discount Rate $ 74.9 $ 8.8 29 More information regarding pension benefits is contained in Note 12 in the Financial Statements. Other Postretirement Benefits We estimate the costs and obligations for postretirement benefits other than pensions using assumptions, including the discount rate and, for plans other than our primary U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit program, expected trends in the cost for healthcare services. Changes in these assumptions and differences between the assumptions and actual experience will affect the amount of postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods. The discount rate used to calculate our 2007 other postretirement benefits expense was 6.50 percent (compared to 5.00 percent in 2006). For 2008, the discount rate assumption for other postretirement benefit expense will decrease to 6.25 percent. The discount rate was set as of our June 30th measurement date and was determined by modeling a portfolio of bonds that match the expected cash flow of our benefit plans. Effective October 1, 2002, we amended our primary U.S. postretirement healthcare benefit program in order to mitigate our share of the increasing cost of postretirement healthcare services. As a result of this amendment, our obligation is less sensitive to increasing healthcare costs resulting from inflationary trends since January 1, 2005. Net periodic benefit cost recorded in continuing operations in 2007 was $13.0 million compared to $18.7 million in 2006. We expect net periodic benefit cost in 2008 of approximately $15.5 million and the estimated postretirement projected benefit obligation to approximate $227.4 million. The increase in net periodic benefit cost is due primarily to the decrease in the discount rate by 25 basis points to 6.25 percent. More information regarding postretirement benefits is contained in Note 12 in the Financial Statements. Revenue Recognition For approximately 90 percent of our consolidated sales, we record sales when all of the following have occurred: an agreement of sale exists; pricing is fixed or determinable; collection is reasonably assured; and product has been delivered and acceptance has occurred, as may be required according to contract terms, or services have been rendered. We recognize revenue for software products and related services in accordance with Statement of Position (SOP) 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition, as issued by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. We recognize substantially all of the remainder of our sales as construction type contracts using either the percentage of completion or completed contract methods of accounting. We record sales relating to these contracts using the percentage of completion method when we determine that progress toward completion is reasonably and reliably estimable; we use the completed contract method for all others. Under the percentage of completion method, we recognize sales and gross profit as work is performed using either (i) the relationship between actual costs incurred and total estimated costs at completion or (ii) units of delivery. Under the percentage of completion method, we adjust sales and gross profit for revisions of estimated total contract costs or revenue in the period the change is identified. We record estimated losses on contracts when they are identified. We use contracts and customer purchase orders to determine the existence of an agreement of sale. We use shipping documents and customer acceptance, when applicable, to verify delivery. We assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment. We assess collectibility based on the creditworthiness of the customer as determined by credit evaluations and analysis, as well as the customers payment history. Returns, Rebates and Incentives Our primary incentive program provides distributors with cash rebates or account credits based on agreed amounts that vary depending on the end user or original equipment manufacturer (OEM) customer to whom our 30 distributor ultimately sells the product. We also offer various other incentive programs that provide distributors and direct sale customers with cash rebates, account credits or additional products and services based on meeting specified program criteria. Certain distributors are offered a right to return product, subject to contractual limitations. We record accruals for customer returns, rebates and incentives at the time of revenue recognition based primarily on historical experience. Adjustments to the accrual may be required if actual returns, rebates and incentives differ from historical experience or if there are changes to other assumptions used to estimate the accrual. A critical assumption used in estimating the accrual for our primary distributor rebate program is the time period from when revenue is recognized to when the rebate is processed. If the time period were to change by 10 percent, the effect would be an adjustment to the accrual of approximately $6.0 million. Returns, rebates and incentives are recognized as a reduction of sales if distributed in cash or customer account credits. Rebates and incentives are recognized in cost of sales for additional products and services to be provided. Accruals are reported as a current liability in our balance sheet or, where a right of set off exists, as a reduction of accounts receivable. The accrual for customer returns, rebates and incentives was $128.6 million at September 30, 2007 and $111.2 million at September 30, 2006, of which $8.1 million at September 30, 2007 and $8.5 million at September 30, 2006 was included as an offset to accounts receivable. Fair Value Measurements We have increased the use of fair value measurements in our financial statements due to recent accounting pronouncements and obligations retained in connection with the sale of the principal businesses of our former Power Systems operating segment. Share based compensation We account for share based compensation under SFAS 123(R). Compensation costs are based on the grant date fair value of the instruments using a valuation model, and are generally recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting term. We estimate the average risk free interest rate, expected dividend yield, expected volatility and expected term of the compensation instrument outstanding in order to determine fair value. The valuation model is most sensitive to the expected volatility and term assumptions. Share based compensation expense net of the related income tax benefit amounted to $18.8 million in 2007 and $16.7 million in 2006. Asset Retirement Obligations We account for conditional asset retirement obligations under Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations (FIN 47). We accrue for costs related to a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset that results from the acquisition, construction, development or the normal operation of the long lived asset. The obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is not conditional even though the timing or method may be conditional. Identified conditional asset retirement obligations include asbestos abatement and remediation of soil contamination beneath current and previously divested facilities. We estimate conditional asset retirement obligations using site specific knowledge and historical industry expertise. A significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates. The application of FIN 47 resulted in a charge, net of tax, of $17.7 million included in the Consolidated Statement of Operations for the year ended September 30, 2006 as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. We recorded these liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet, which totaled $5.3 million in other current liabilities and $21.8 million in other liabilities at September 30, 2007 and $28.7 million in other liabilities at September 30, 2006. Indemnifications In conjunction with the sale of our Dodge mechanical and Reliance Electric motors and motor repair services businesses, we agreed to indemnify Baldor for costs and damages related to certain legacy legal, 31 environmental and asbestos matters of these businesses arising before January 31, 2007, for which the maximum exposure would be capped at the purchase price. We recorded a liability under FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others An Interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57, and 107 and Rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34 (FIN 45), related to these indemnification obligations with an offset to the gain on sale. A significant change in the costs or timing could have a significant effect on our estimates. We estimate the potential future payments we could incur under these indemnifications may approximate $32.5 million, of which $9.6 million has been accrued in other current liabilities and $16.1 million has been accrued in other liabilities at September 30, 2007. Derivatives Our accounting method for derivative instruments is based on SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133). The fair value of all derivative financial instruments is recorded in the balance sheet, which is based on the quoted market prices for contracts with similar maturities. We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swap contracts to manage foreign currency and interest rate risks. We use foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset changes in the amount of future cash flows associated with intercompany transactions expected to occur within the next three years (cash flow hedges) and changes in the fair value of certain assets and liabilities resulting from intercompany loans and other transactions with third parties denominated in foreign currencies. We sometimes use interest rate swap contracts to manage the balance of fixed and floating rate debt. Unrealized gains on derivative instruments are recorded in other current assets and total $5.2 million and $1.9 million at September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Unrealized losses on derivative instruments are recorded in other current liabilities and total $38.2 million and $8.5 million at September 30, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Purchase Accounting When we acquire a business, we account for the assets and liabilities acquired at fair value at the date of acquisition in accordance with SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. The valuation of acquired identifiable intangible assets and determination of their amortizable lives requires the use of management judgment and assumptions. See Note 2 in the Financial Statements for a discussion of acquisitions in 2007 and 2006. Litigation, Claims and Contingencies We record liabilities for litigation, claims and contingencies when an obligation is probable and when we have a basis to reasonably estimate the value of an obligation. We also record liabilities for environmental matters based on estimates for known environmental remediation exposures. The liabilities include accruals for sites we currently own or operate or formerly owned or operated and third party sites where we were determined to be a potentially responsible party. At third party sites where more than one potentially responsible party has been identified, we record a liability for our estimated allocable share of costs related to our involvement with the site as well as an estimated allocable share of costs related to the involvement of insolvent or unidentified parties. At environmental sites where we are the only responsible party, we record a liability for the total estimated costs of remediation. We do not discount future expenditures for environmental remediation obligations to their present value. Environmental liability estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental exposure or an acceptable level of cleanup. To the extent that remediation procedures change, additional contamination is identified, or the financial condition of other potentially responsible parties is adversely affected, the estimate of our environmental liabilities may change. Our reserve for environmental matters, net of related receivables, was $29.8 million at September 30, 2007 and $37.0 million at September 30, 2006. The change is primarily due to a legal settlement and changes in estimated remediation costs at three sites as a result of new information. 32 Our recorded liability for environmental matters relates almost entirely to businesses formerly owned by us (legacy businesses) for which we retained the responsibility to remediate. The nature of our current business is such that the likelihood of new environmental exposures that could result in a significant charge to earnings is low. As a result of remediation efforts at legacy sites and limited new environmental matters, we expect that gradually, over a long period of time, our environmental obligations will decline. However, changes in remediation procedures at existing legacy sites or discovery of contamination at additional sites could result in increases to our environmental obligations. Various lawsuits, claims and proceedings have been or may be instituted or asserted against us relating to the conduct of our business, including those pertaining to product liability. As described in Item 3. Legal Proceedings, we have been named as a defendant in lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos that was used in certain components of our products many years ago. See Item 3 for further discussion. Our principal self insurance programs include product liability where we are self insured up to a specified dollar amount. Claims exceeding this amount up to specified limits are covered by policies issued by commercial insurers. We estimate the reserve for product liability claims, using our claims experience for the periods being valued. Adjustments to the product liability reserves may be required to reflect emerging claims experience and other factors such as inflationary trends or the outcome of claims. The reserve for product liability claims was $24.0 million at September 30, 2007 and $25.8 million at September 30, 2006. More information regarding litigation, claims and contingencies is contained in Note 17 in the Financial Statements. Income Taxes We operate in numerous taxing jurisdictions and are subject to regular examinations by U.S. Federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. Additionally, we have retained tax liabilities and the rights to tax refunds in connection with various divestitures of businesses in prior years. Our income tax positions are based on research and interpretations of the income tax laws and rulings in each of the jurisdictions in which we do business. Due to the subjectivity of interpretations of laws and rulings in each jurisdiction, the differences and interplay in tax laws between those jurisdictions as well as the inherent uncertainty in estimating the final resolution of complex tax audit matters, our estimates of income tax liabilities may differ from actual payments or assessments. While we have support for the positions we take on our tax returns, taxing authorities are increasingly asserting interpretations of laws and facts and challenging cross jurisdictional transactions. Cross jurisdictional transactions between our subsidiaries involving the transfer price for products, services, and or intellectual property as well as various U.S. state tax matters comprise our more significant income tax exposures. We regularly assess our position with regard to tax exposures and record liabilities for uncertain tax positions and related interest and penalties, if any, according to the principles of SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS 5). We have recorded an accrual of $104.5 million at September 30, 2007 and $85.1 million at September 30, 2006 that reflects our estimate of the likely outcome of current and future audits, which is included in other liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. A final determination of these tax audits or changes in our estimates may result in additional future income tax expense or benefit. In the first quarter of 2008, we will adopt FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48). Upon adoption of this standard, we will assess our position with regard to tax exposures and uncertain tax positions under its requirements rather than under SFAS 5. The adoption of FIN 48 as of October 1, 2007 will result in a decrease to shareowners equity of up to $10 million. We have recorded a valuation allowance for the majority of our deferred tax assets related to net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards (Carryforwards) and certain temporary differences in the amount of $42.6 million at September 30, 2007 and $36.8 million at September 30, 2006 based on the projected profitability of the entity in the respective tax jurisdiction. The valuation allowance is based on an evaluation of the uncertainty that the Carryforward amount will be realized. Our income would increase if we determine we will be able to use more Carryforwards than currently expected. 33 At the end of each interim reporting period, we estimate a base effective tax rate, which is the effective tax rate that we expect for the full fiscal year based on our most recent forecast of pretax income, permanent book and tax differences and global tax planning strategies. We use this base rate to provide for income taxes on a year to date basis, excluding the effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items or items that are reported net of their related tax effects. We recognize the tax effect of significant unusual or extraordinary items in the period in which they are realizable. More information regarding income taxes is contained in Note 16 in the Financial Statements. Recent Accounting Pronouncements See Note 1 in the Financial Statements regarding recent accounting pronouncements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are exposed to market risk during the normal course of business from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We manage exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating and financing activities and derivative financial instruments in the form of interest rate swap contracts and foreign currency forward exchange contracts. Interest Rate Risk In addition to existing cash balances and cash provided by normal operating activities, we use a combination of short term and long term debt to finance operations. We are exposed to interest rate risk on certain of these debt obligations. Our short term debt obligations relate to commercial paper borrowings and bank borrowings. At September 30, 2007, we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $173.0 million with original maturities of three days at a weighted average interest rate of 5.1 percent; at September 30, 2006, we had outstanding commercial paper borrowings of $219.0 million with original maturities of three days at a weighted average interest rate of 5.4 percent. The weighted average interest rate on the commercial paper borrowings was 5.3 percent during 2007 and 4.8 percent during 2006. As these obligations mature, we issued, and anticipate continuing to issue, additional short term commercial paper obligations to refinance all or part of these borrowings. Changes in market interest rates on commercial paper borrowings affect our results of operations. In 2007 and 2006, a 10 percent increase in average market interest rates would not have had a significant effect on our results of operations. We had outstanding fixed rate long term debt obligations with carrying values of $753.9 million at September 30, 2007 and $748.2 million at September 30, 2006. The fair value of this debt was $777.3 million at September 30, 2007 and $803.7 million at September 30, 2006. The potential reduction in fair value on such fixed rate debt obligations from a hypothetical 10 percent increase in market interest rates would not be material to the overall fair value of the debt. We currently have no plans to repurchase our outstanding fixed rate instruments before their maturity and, therefore, fluctuations in market interest rates would not have an effect on our results of operations or shareowners equity. In September 2002, we entered into an interest rate swap contract that effectively converted our $350.0 million aggregate principal amount of 6.15% notes, payable in 2008, to floating rate debt based on six month LIBOR. The floating rate was 7.80 percent at September 30, 2007. A hypothetical 10 percent change in market interest rates would not be significant to the overall fair value of the swap or our results of operations. Foreign Currency Risk We are exposed to foreign currency risks that arise from normal business operations. These risks include the translation of local currency balances of foreign subsidiaries, intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries and 34 transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Our objective is to minimize our exposure to these risks through a combination of normal operating activities and foreign currency forward exchange contracts to manage our exposure on transactions denominated in currencies other than the applicable functional currency. In addition, we enter into contracts to hedge certain intercompany transactions forecasted to occur within the next three years. Contracts are executed with creditworthy banks and are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries. We do not enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes. We do not hedge our exposure to the translation of reported results of foreign subsidiaries from local currency to U.S. dollars. A 10 percent adverse change in the underlying foreign currency exchange rates would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations. We record all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value regardless of the purpose for holding them. Derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes are adjusted to fair value through earnings. For derivatives that are hedges, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value are either offset by changes in the fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We recognize the ineffective portion of a derivatives change in fair value in earnings immediately. At September 30, 2007 and 2006, we had outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts primarily consisting of contracts relating to the euro, British pound sterling, Swiss franc, Singapore dollar and South Korean won. The use of these contracts allows us to manage transactional exposure to exchange rate fluctuations as the gains or losses incurred on the foreign currency forward exchange contracts will offset, in whole or in part, losses or gains on the underlying foreign currency exposure. A hypothetical 10 percent adverse change in underlying foreign currency exchange rates associated with these contracts would not be significant to our financial condition or results of operations. The following table indicates the total U.S. dollar equivalents (in millions) of net transactional foreign exchange exposure related to (short) long contracts outstanding by currency: September 30, 2007 2006 Euro $ (427.8 ) $ (399.8 ) British pound sterling (273.0 ) (35.7 ) Swiss franc 59.5 12.7 Singapore dollar (55.6 ) South Korean won (15.1 ) (21.5 ) Other 0.7 1.5 Total $ (711.3 ) $ (442.8 ) All of the contracts included in the table above will have offsetting effects from actual transactions that have occurred or will occur in the future. We designated certain of these contracts related to intercompany transactions forecasted to occur through October 2010 as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The remaining foreign exchange contracts offset actual underlying receivables and payables in our Consolidated Balance Sheet. 35
