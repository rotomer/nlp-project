Restructuring charges were incurred only in fiscal 2001 and were $2,230, $279 and $50 in Industrial Controls, Fluid Handling and Analytical Instrumentation, respectively. Unallocated corporate administrative costs were $9,688, $6,373 and $7,117 for the years ended October 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. /(3)/ Includes results of Abel Pump from May 2000 and several smaller businesses acquired during the years presented. /(4)/ Includes results of Photometrics from April 1998, the fiscal 1999 Petroleum Analyzer acquisitions from June 1999, MASD from November 1999, Antek Instruments from August 2000, Struers and Logitech from September 2001 and several smaller businesses acquired during the years presented. 13 Year Ended October 31, 2001 Compared to Year Ended October 31, 2000 Net sales for fiscal 2001 were $586.5 million, a 16% increase compared to fiscal 2000. Excluding sales to RAO Gazprom ("Gazprom", a large Russian natural gas company), net sales increased 14% in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000. Fiscal 2001 pro forma net sales (adjusted to remove exited operations) increased 5% compared to pro forma net sales during fiscal 2000 (also adjusted to include the results of companies acquired during fiscal 2001 for the same length of time as included in fiscal 2001s results). In the Analytical Instrumentation segment, actual net sales increased 18% and pro forma net sales increased 5%. The increase in actual net sales resulted mostly from the contribution of companies acquired during fiscal 2001 and 2000. The increase in pro forma net sales resulted mostly from strong digital imaging demand from research markets. Weakness in the automobile industry adversely affected sales of Ropers high speed digital camera products and its industrial leak test products. In the Fluid Handling segment, actual net sales increased 3% and pro forma net sales decreased 7%. Actual net sales increased primarily as the result of companies acquired over the past two years. Pro forma net sales decreased primarily as the result of depressed business conditions in the semiconductor industry. This segments pro forma net sales to this industry decreased 33% in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000. Roper expects these sales to be lower still in fiscal 2002. Net sales in fiscal 2001 for this segments businesses not serving the semiconductor industry increased 2% compared to pro forma net sales in fiscal 2000. In the Industrial Controls segment, actual net sales increased 24% and pro forma net sales increased 13%. Actual net sales increased primarily as a result of companies acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2000, increased shipments to Gazprom and higher revenues from customers in energy markets. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues at Petrotech that resulted from restructuring activities that occurred during fiscal 2001. Pro forma net sales increased primarily as a result of additional sales to Gazprom. Sales to Gazprom were $49.3 million during fiscal 2001, or an increase of 45% compared to fiscal 2000. Ropers overall gross profit percentage increased to 52.7% in fiscal 2001 compared to 51.4% in fiscal 2000. Several factors were the largest contributors to the change. The largest factor was the growth in the Analytical Instrumentation segment, Ropers highest gross margin segment. Other large factors contributing to increased margins were improved leverage on the additional sales to Gazprom and the benefits from exiting certain low margin businesses at Petrotech during 2001. Adversely affecting margins were the increased sales from Ropers lower margin refrigeration valves business that was acquired in September 2000. Analytical Instrumentations gross margin increased to 55.9% in fiscal 2001 compared to 54.4% in fiscal 2000. Most of this improvement resulted from favorable leverage related to increased digital imaging sales and the incremental sales at Struers and Logitech that were at relatively high margins. Fluid Handlings gross margin decreased to 48.4% in fiscal 2001 compared to 48.5% in fiscal 2000. This decrease was caused mostly by lower sales of its high margin semiconductor related products. Industrial Controls gross margin increased to 51.1% in fiscal 2001 compared to 49.3% in fiscal 14 2000. This increase was caused primarily by the favorable effects of increased sales to Gazprom and lower sales from exited businesses, and was partially offset by increased sales of lower margin refrigeration valve products. Selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 are presented in the following table. 2001 2000 Total Adjusted* Total Adjusted* Analytical Instrumentation 39.5% 36.2% 38.0% 34.5% Fluid Handling 26.8 24.5 24.1 22.3 Industrial Controls 31.9 28.5 31.4 29.8 Corporate 1.7 1.7 1.3 1.3 Total 35.9% 32.8% 33.9% 31.3% * Excludes goodwill amortization (2001 and 2000) and restructuring charges (2001). The increase in SG&A costs as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 for the Fluid Handling segment was caused by the adverse leverage that resulted from the quick and deep cyclical decline in the segments semiconductor related business. Other changes in the relationships between SG&A costs and net sales were not considered significant. Interest expense was $15.9 million in fiscal 2001 compared to $13.5 million in fiscal 2000. Interest expense was higher in fiscal 2001 mostly due to the borrowings associated with the acquisitions that occurred since the beginning of fiscal 2000. All of these acquisitions, representing total costs of over $330 million during these two fiscal years, were paid for with cash provided by Ropers then existing credit facilities. Short term interest rates started to decline dramatically early in calendar 2001. Ropers effective interest rate was approximately 6.5% during fiscal 2001 compared to approximately 6.9% during fiscal 2000. The provision for income taxes was 35.4% of pretax earnings in fiscal 2001 compared to 35.1% in fiscal 2000. This change was not considered significant. Ropers other components of comprehensive earnings in fiscal 2001 were currency translation adjustments resulting from net assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These net assets were primarily denominated in euros (or euro equivalent currencies), British pounds, Danish krone or Japanese yen. During fiscal 2001, the U.S. dollar weakened against the euro, was relatively stable against the pound and strengthened against the yen and krone (after the acquisition of Danish assets in September). During fiscal 2001, Ropers consolidated net assets increased $1.2 million due to foreign currency translation adjustments. 15 Net sales orders Year ended October 31, 2001 2000 Pro forma Pro forma Actual Pro forma Actual change (in thousands) Analytical Instrumentation $ 260,927 $ 260,927 $ 273,105 $ 239,903 4 % Fluid Handling 121,231 121,231 142,858 128,925 15 Industrial Controls 195,073 200,681 170,267 160,136 +15 $ 577,231 $ 582,839 $ 586,230 $ 528,964 2 % The decrease in Analytical Instrumentations pro forma net sales orders in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was broad based. Net sales orders for each major product group declined from 2% 9%. This segments businesses were adversely affected by poor market conditions in the automotive and semiconductor industries. The decrease in pro forma net sales orders for the Fluid Handling segment was caused largely by a decline in semiconductor related orders. The increase in pro forma net sales orders for the Industrial Controls segment was caused primarily by additional orders from Gazprom. Sales order backlog October 31, 2001 2000 Pro forma Pro forma Actual Pro forma Actual Change (in thousands) Analytical Instrumentation $ 62,609 $ 62,609 $ 68,092 $ 54,550 8 % Fluid Handling 21,678 21,678 26,073 26,073 17 Industrial Controls 31,217 31,217 25,166 29,246 +24 $ 115,504 $ 115,504 $ 119,331 $ 109,869 3 % Changes in sales order backlog were consistent with changes in net sales orders. Year Ended October 31, 2000 Compared to Year Ended October 31, 1999 Net sales for fiscal 2000 of $503.8 million were up 24% compared to the prior year. Excluding net sales to Gazprom, net sales increased 26% in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999. Net sales for fiscal 2000 were 1% less than pro forma net sales for fiscal 1999. Net sales for the Analytical Instrumentation segment increased 50%, mostly the result of business acquisitions (Petroleum Analyzer, MASD, Antek Instruments and other smaller businesses). This segments net sales were 2% less than the prior years pro forma net sales largely from lower comparative sales in fluid properties test equipment markets. Net sales for the Fluid Handling segment increased 23%, mostly the result of business acquisitions (Abel Pump and other smaller businesses) and a very strong fiscal 2000 for this segments 16 semiconductor related business. This segments net sales were 6% higher than pro forma net sales for fiscal 1999. Fluid Handlings historical semiconductor business increased its net sales in fiscal 2000 by 81% (partly from favorable comparisons to reported net sales in the first half of fiscal 1999) and its acquired business increased its net sales by 51% compared to the same period in the prior year. Fiscal 2000 net sales for this segments centrifugal pump business decreased 19% compared to the prior year due to weak agricultural and water/wastewater markets. Agricultural markets were adversely impacted by widespread drought conditions and low commodity prices in the United States. Roper believes the municipal water and wastewater markets were adversely affected by resources diverted to minimize Y2K exposures early in fiscal 2000, and its centrifugal pump business had increased exposure to these markets as it developed larger pumps to pursue more lucrative projects. Fluid Handlings piston metering pumps business net sales were also down 15% compared to fiscal 1999 as this companys largest customer reduced its purchases until it resolves an FDA compliance problem unrelated to this companys products. Net sales for the Industrial Controls segment decreased less than 1% in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 and fiscal 2000 net sales were 3% less than pro forma fiscal 1999 net sales. The timing of this segments primary fiscal 2000 acquisition (Hansen Technologies in September 2000) was such that it did not significantly affect fiscal 2000 results. This segment was significantly influenced by conditions in the exploration and production sectors of the oil & gas industry. Roper believes several large oil & gas business combinations early in the year delayed capital spending programs, and spending had yet to recover from the effects of relatively low oil and natural gas prices throughout much of fiscal 1999. Throughout fiscal 2000, net sales each quarter (excluding sales to Gazprom) improved in comparison to the same quarter of fiscal 1999. Whereas these first quarter net sales were down 22% compared to the prior year, fourth quarter net sales (also excluding Hansen Technologies) were up 13%. Net sales to Gazprom of $33.9 million in fiscal 2000 were comparable to fiscal 1999 net sales of $35.0 million. The gross profit percentage for the Analytical Instrumentation segment decreased to 54.4% in fiscal 2000 compared to 56.3% in fiscal 1999. This decrease arose mostly from the inclusion of MASD for most of fiscal 2000. If MASDs results were excluded from the segments results in fiscal 2000, the segments gross profit percentage was 55.9%. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2000 and fiscal 1999 are presented in the following table. 2000 1999 Total Adjusted* Total Adjusted* Analytical Instrumentation 38.0 % 34.5 % 37.7 % 34.1 % Fluid Handling 24.1 22.3 20.6 19.0 Industrial Controls 31.4 29.8 30.6 29.3 Corporate 1.3 1.3 1.7 1.7 Total 33.9 % 31.3 % 32.5 % 30.3 % * Excludes goodwill amortization. SG&A expenses increased as a percentage of net sales for Roper as a whole because of the increased costs in the Fluid Handling segment and the increased size of the Analytical 17 Instrumentation segment with its relatively high level of SG&A expenses compared to Ropers other business segments. SG&A expenses for the Fluid Handling segment increased as a percentage of net sales mostly due to relatively high cost structures of recent acquisitions, particularly Abel Pump and Flowdata. Another significant reason for this segments increased SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales was the adverse leverage associated with the decline in the segments centrifugal pump business combined with the added costs of this business moving into a larger facility early in fiscal 2000. Other changes in the relationships between SG&A costs and net sales were not considered significant. Interest expense was $13.5 million in fiscal 2000 compared to $7.3 million in fiscal 1999. Interest expense was higher in fiscal 2000 due primarily to the borrowings associated with the numerous acquisitions that occurred during fiscal 1999 and especially during fiscal 2000. All of these acquisitions, representing total costs of approximately $200 million during these two fiscal years, were paid for with cash provided by Ropers then existing credit facilities. The provision for income taxes was 35.1% of pretax earnings in fiscal 2000 compared to 34.5% in fiscal 1999. The increase in the effective income tax rate was due to several of the recent acquisitions located in relatively high income tax rate jurisdictions and the amortization of some goodwill associated with these acquisitions was not deductible for income tax purposes. Ropers other components of comprehensive earnings in fiscal 2000 were currency translation adjustments resulting from net assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These net assets were primarily denominated in euros, British pounds or Japanese yen. The U.S. dollar strengthened against each of these currencies during fiscal 2000, but especially against the euro and particularly during Ropers fourth quarter of fiscal 2000. During fiscal 2000, Ropers consolidated net assets decreased $6.7 million ($4.1 million in the fourth quarter) due to foreign currency translation adjustments. Ropers goodwill denominated in non U.S. currencies also decreased by $6.7 million due to currency translation adjustments. 18 The following table summarizes Ropers net sales orders and sales order backlog information (in thousands). The pro forma amounts include comparable time periods for those companies acquired during fiscal 2000. Net sales orders Sales order backlog Year ended October 31, October 31, 2000 1999 2000 1999 Actual Pro forma Actual Actual Pro forma Actual Analytical Instrumentation $ 239,903 $ 228,000 $ 148,478 $ 54,550 $ 41,693 $ 30,000 Fluid Handling 128,925 117,125 100,600 26,073 19,103 14,375 Industrial Controls 160,136 157,596 150,604 29,246 30,405 29,286 $ 528,964 $ 502,721 $ 399,682 $ 109,869 $ 91,201 $ 73,661 The increase in Analytical Instrumentations net sales orders in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 pro forma net sales orders was mostly due to an 8% increase in the segments digital imaging businesses and a 20% increase in its spectroscopy business (which was influenced by the strong semiconductor industry). The increase in Fluid Handlings net sales orders in fiscal 2000 compared to fiscal 1999 pro forma net sales orders was mostly due to continued strength in the segments semiconductor related businesses, whose net sales orders increased 68%. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Total current assets exceeded total current liabilities by $129.2 million at October 31, 2001 compared to $129.5 million at October 31, 2000. Total debt was $326.8 million at October 31, 2001 (50% of total capital) compared to $241.3 million at October 31, 2000 (47% of total capital). Ropers increased debt and increased financial leverage at October 31, 2001 compared to that a year ago was due to the additional borrowings incurred to fund fiscal 2001 business acquisitions. Ropers principal $275 million credit facility with a group of banks provides most of its daily external financing requirements, consisting of revolving loans, swing line loans and letters of credit. At October 31, 2001, utilization of this facility included $86.5 million of U.S. denominated borrowings, the equivalent of $91.6 million of non U.S. denominated borrowings and $2.9 million of outstanding letters of credit. Total unused availability under this facility was $94.0 million at October 31, 2001. This facility matures May 2005. Roper also has a number of smaller facilities in various non U.S. locations to support the businesses in these locations. Ropers outstanding indebtedness at October 31, 2001 also included $125 million of term notes. One set of notes totaling $40 million matures May 2007. The other set of notes totaling $85 million matures May 2010. Neither set of notes requires sinking fund payments. Roper may prepay either set of notes by paying the holders thereof the discounted present value of all remaining scheduled payments using a discount rate equal to a risk free rate plus a margin. 19 Although the excess of current assets over current liabilities at October 31, 2001 and 2000 were similar, Roper acquired approximately $30 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during fiscal 2001. Reductions in net current assets were attributed to improved management of accounts receivable, inventories and payables. Capital expenditures were $7.5 million during fiscal 2001 compared to the $15.2 million incurred during fiscal 2000. In November 2001, Ropers Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend paid on its outstanding common stock to $0.0825 per share from $0.075 per share, an increase of 10%. This represents the ninth consecutive year in which the quarterly dividend has been increased since Ropers 1992 initial public offering. Ropers Board of Directors has declared a dividend payable on January 31, 2002. Payment of any additional dividends requires further action by the Board of Directors. Roper believes that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under its various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities. Although Roper maintains an active acquisition program, any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on Ropers activities, financial condition and results of operations. Roper may also explore alternatives to increase its access to additional capital resources. Roper anticipates that its recently acquired companies as well as its other companies will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a pace consistent with that which Roper historically has experienced. However, the rate at which Roper can reduce its debt during fiscal 2002 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of its existing companies and cannot be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards ("SFAS") 141 "Business Combinations" that applies to all business combinations completed subsequent to June 30, 2001. SFAS 141 requires use of the purchase method for accounting for a business combination. Other provisions of SFAS 141 must be adopted concurrently with the adoption of SFAS 142. Roper does not expect the full adoption of SFAS 141 to significantly affect its accounting for any business combinations completed prior to June 30, 2001. The FASB issued SFAS 142 "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" that Roper intends to adopt effective November 1, 2001 (otherwise, adoption would be required on November 1, 2002). Once adopted, this standard provides that goodwill will no longer be subject to amortization. Instead, 20 goodwill will be subjected to a periodic analysis to evaluate possible impairment. Any such impairment would be recognized as an expense immediately. The FASB issued SFAS 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" that Roper is required to adopt by November 1, 2002. Roper does not currently have, nor is it expected to have, any material asset retirement obligations subject to this new standard. The FASB issued SFAS 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" that Roper is required to adopt by November 1, 2002. This new standard does not apply to goodwill. Roper does not expect the adoption of this standard to result in an impairment charge. Outlook Fiscal 2002 is expected to be another record year for sales and earnings. Fiscal 2002 is expected to benefit from the full year contributions from the businesses acquired during fiscal 2001, especially Struers and Logitech. Fiscal 2002 earnings would also benefit from the adoption of SFAS 142. Goodwill amortization was $15.7 million during fiscal 2001. The conditions in the semiconductor industry are currently poor and Roper expects its product sales into this industry to be lower in fiscal 2002 than they were in 2001 on a pro forma basis. Roper does not expect this industry to show any significant signs of improvement before at least the second half of 2002. The terrorist attacks in the United States on September 11, 2001 and the aftereffects related thereto still cast a significant cloud of uncertainty over the near term health of the economy in the United States and elsewhere. The U.S. economy was also showing signs of weakening prior to the September 11 attacks. It is impossible to isolate each of these factors effects on current economic conditions. It is also impossible to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty what or when any additional events may occur that also will similarly disrupt the economy. Roper expects to continue an active acquisition program. However, completion of future acquisitions and their impact on Ropers results or financial condition cannot be accurately predicted. Forward Looking Information The information provided elsewhere in this Annual Report, in Ropers filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in press releases and in other public disclosures contains forward looking statements about Ropers businesses and prospects. These forward looking statements generally can be identified by use of statements that include phrases such as "believe," "expect," "anticipate," "intend," "plan," "foresee," "likely," "will" or other similar words or phrases. Similarly, statements that describe Ropers objectives, plans or goals are or may be forward looking statements. These forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which generally are beyond Ropers control and which may cause Ropers actual results, performance or achievements to be different from any future results, performance and achievements expressed or implied by these statements. Some of these risks include the level and the timing of future business with Gazprom and other Eastern European 21 customers and their ability to obtain financing, changes in interest and currency exchange rates, market conditions including the duration and extent of the current economic recession, the continued success of Ropers cost reduction efforts, the future operating results of newly acquired companies and consequences stemming from the September 11 terrorist activities. There is no assurance that these and other risks and uncertainties will not have an adverse impact on Ropers future operations, financial condition, or financial results. Roper does not undertake any obligation to update any forward looking statements. 22 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Roper is exposed to interest rate risks on its outstanding borrowings. It is exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on its transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. It is also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of its common stock. At October 31, 2001, Roper had a combination of fixed rate borrowings (primarily $125 million of term notes) and relatively variable rate borrowings (primarily borrowings under the $275 million credit facility). Although each borrowing under the $275 million credit facility has a fixed rate, the terms of these individual borrowings are generally only 1 3 months. At October 31, 2001, interest rates were lower than the fixed rates on the term notes. This resulted in the estimated fair values of the term notes being greater than the face amounts of the notes. Roper estimated this difference to be $11.7 million and it represented an unrecorded decrease in Ropers net assets at October 31, 2001. If interest rates had been 0.1% higher, the difference between the fair values of the term notes and their face values would have decreased to $10.9 million. At October 31, 2001, Ropers outstanding variable rate borrowings under the $275 million credit facility were $178.1 million. An increase in interest rates of 0.1% would increase Ropers annualized interest costs by $178,000. Several Roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros (or equivalent currencies), British pounds, Danish krone or Japanese yen. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 23% of Ropers total sales. The U.S. dollar was mixed against these currencies during fiscal 2001. Comparing currency exchange rates at October 31, 2001 to October 31, 2000, the dollar weakened 7% against the euro, was flat against the pound and strengthened 11% against yen. The dollar strengthened 1% against the krone over the last two months of fiscal 2001. These exchange rate changes had an immaterial impact on sales and earnings during fiscal 2001. Excluding the effects of any future acquisitions, the percentage of non U.S. dollar denominated sales is expected to be higher in fiscal in 2002. The changes of these currencies relative to the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2001 also resulted in an increase in net assets of $1.2 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings. This change is believed to have a minimal impact on expected future cash flows. The traded price of Ropers common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in Ropers financial statements. The stock prices also influence the computation of the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted earnings per share. Certain cash compensation arrangements are also directly related to Ropers stock price. The stock price also affects Ropers employees perceptions of various Roper programs that involve its common stock. 23
