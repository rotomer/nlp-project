ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with "Selection Financial Information" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Within this Annual Report, we have provided pro forma sales and sales orders information. This pro forma information is not presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and does not conform to the pro forma information presented in our consolidated financial statements. We present this pro forma information because management believes that the information illustrates the impact of acquisitions on our performance. For the purposes of calculating pro forma net sales, net sales orders and sales order backlog information, we have added sales and sales order information of each company that Roper has acquired during one of the two periods being compared to the appropriate period, so that the acquired companys results are included for the same number of months for both periods. Further, pro forma net sales, net sales orders and sales order backlog information exclude amounts attributable to discontinued or divested operations for the period presented. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. A discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2002 included elsewhere in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long lived assets, recognizing revenues and issuing stock options to employees. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements, except for the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" as discussed below. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively. 14 Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory utilization, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percent of completion), income taxes and goodwill analysis. These issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases, credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At October 31, 2002, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, sales returns and sales credits was $3.8 million, or 3% of total gross accounts receivable excluding securitized Gazprom receivables from a vendor financing program. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables. During 2002, that profile improved with the acquisition of Zetec and other improvements in collections from core businesses, and the allowance was reduced as a percent of net sales by 50 basis points. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. Business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances. At October 31, 2002, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $20.2 million, or 18% of gross first in, first out inventory cost. This percentage has increased by 390 basis points over the year as the relative age of inventory increased during the cyclical downturn. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. At October 31, 2002, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $3.7 million or 0.5% of proforma sales. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the three years ended October 31, 2002. Revenues related to the use of the percentage of completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, we recognized revenue of approximately $1.9 million, $7.9 million and $5.6 million, respectively using this method. In addition, approximately $8.3 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage of completion contracts had yet to be recognized at October 31, 2002. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. 15 Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions, future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During fiscal 2002, our effective income tax rate was reduced to 31% from 34%. Two of the key factors related to the reduced rate were our expected utilization of all available foreign income tax credits and the accounting change related to goodwill amortization that was expensed for book purposes prior to the adoption of SFAS 142 but not deductible for income tax purposes. We adopted SFAS No. 142 effective November 1, 2001 the beginning of our fiscal 2002. SFAS 142, issued in June 2001, requires the adoption of its provisions by the beginning of our fiscal 2003, but the timing of our fiscal year end also allowed it to elect to adopt SFAS 142 at the beginning of fiscal 2002. Based primarily on investor interest to see results reflecting adoption of SFAS 142, we elected to adopt this new standard at the earlier date. The evaluation of goodwill under SFAS 142 requires valuations of each applicable underlying business. These valuations can be significantly affected by estimates of future performance and discount rates over a relatively long period of time, market price valuation multiples and marketplace transactions in related markets. These estimates will likely change over time. Some of our businesses operate in cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality. The transitional business valuation reviews required by SFAS 142 indicated a reduction of the carrying value of goodwill for three business units in the analytical instrumentation and industrial controls segments. This goodwill reduction has been reported as a change in accounting principle retroactive to the beginning of fiscal 2002 and resulted in a transitional charge to earnings of approximately $26 million. After the adoption of SFAS 142, goodwill is required to be evaluated annually. If this annual review indicates further impairment of goodwill balances, that entire impairment will be recorded immediately and reported as a component of current operations. Our acquisitions have generally included a large goodwill component and we expect to continue with future acquisitions. Prior to adopting SFAS 142, goodwill was amortized over periods not exceeding 40 years. With the adoption of this standard, goodwill is not amortized. It is periodically reviewed for impairment as discussed above. SFAS 142 does not permit retroactive application to years prior to adoption. Therefore, earnings beginning in fiscal 2002 tend to be higher than earlier periods as a result of this accounting change, except for the effects of any impairment provision on current results. Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements includes a reconciliation comparing earnings of pre adoption periods to earnings of current periods for those periods presented. Goodwill amortization prior to the adoption of SFAS 142 was largest in the analytical instrumentation segment and the amount of goodwill currently recorded is also largest for this segment. We believe it inappropriate to conclude whether the likelihood of any impairment charge resulting from subsequent annual reviews is more likely in any business segment compared to another segment. 16 At October 31, 2002, Ropers total assets included $460.2 million of goodwill. Goodwill was allocated $288.4 million to our analytical instrumentation segment, $66.0 million to our fluid handling segment and $105.8 million to our industrial controls segment. Total goodwill was allocated to 23 different business units with individual amounts ranging from less than $1 million to approximately $78 million. 17 Results of Operations General The following tables set forth selected information for the years indicated. Dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales. Year ended October 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net sales Analytical Instrumentation(1) $ 318,839 $ 264,369 $ 223,164 Fluid Handling(2) 105,441 125,399 121,387 Industrial Controls(3) 202,750 196,738 159,262 Total $ 627,030 $ 586,506 $ 503,813 Gross profit: Analytical Instrumentation 56.1% 55.9% 54.4% Fluid Handling 46.2 48.4 48.5 Industrial Controls 53.7 51.1 49.3 Total 53.6 52.7 51.4 Operating profit: Analytical Instrumentation 18.2% 19.7% 19.9% Fluid Handling 20.4 23.9 26.2 Industrial Controls 24.0 22.6 19.5 Total 20.5 21.5 21.3 Operating profit 20.5% 21.5% 21.3% Goodwill amortization (2.7) (2.5) Corporate administrative expenses (2.2) (1.6) (1.3) Restructuring charges(4) (0.4) Income from operations 18.3 16.8 17.5 Interest expense (3.0) (2.7) (2.7) Euro debt currency exchange loss (0.7) Other income 0.6 0.6 0.3 Earnings before income taxes and change in accounting principle 15.2 14.7 15.1 Income taxes (4.7) (5.2) (5.3) Goodwill adjustment effective November 1, 2001, net of taxes (4.1) Net earnings 6.4% 9.5% 9.8% (1) Includes results of Antek Instruments from August 2000, Struers and Logitech from September 2001 and several smaller businesses acquired during the years presented. (2) Includes results of Abel Pump from May 2000 and several smaller businesses acquired during the years presented. (3) Includes results of Hansen Technologies from September 2000, Zetec from August 2002 and several smaller businesses acquired during the years presented. (4) Restructuring charges were $2,230,000, $279,000 and $50,000 in industrial controls, fluid handling and analytical instrumentation, respectively. 18 Year Ended October 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended October 31, 2001 Net sales for fiscal 2002 were $627.0 million, a 7% increase compared to fiscal 2001, and a 7% decrease on a pro forma basis compared to fiscal 2001. The 7% increase over prior year is attributable to the inclusion of full year sales from Struers and Logitech, which were acquired in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2001 as well as sales from the acquisition of Zetec in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2002. These sales increases were offset by exiting certain Petrotech businesses and sales declines in other businesses due to widespread weak economic conditions. The 7% decrease compared to pro forma net sales is primarily attributable to exiting of certain Petrotech businesses, continued declines in the semiconductor market and the downturn in oil and gas exploration and certain industrial markets. The impact of these difficult market conditions was somewhat mitigated by a 15% increase in sales to Gazprom and an 8% increase in sales in our fluid properties testing businesses as their products help customers respond to stricter environmental controls regarding sulfur content in petroleum products. In our Analytical Instrumentation segment, actual net sales increased 21% and pro forma net sales decreased 7%. The increase in actual net sales resulted principally from the contribution of acquisitions and increased sales in our fluid properties testing businesses. This was offset by lower sales into semiconductor markets and lower motion product sales by Redlake due to the pending release of a new generation of products that we anticipate to begin shipping during the first half of fiscal 2003. In our Fluid Handling segment, net sales declined 16% compared to fiscal 2001 primarily from the downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment market and weakness in industrial and oil & gas exploration markets. In our Industrial Controls segment, actual net sales increased 3% and pro forma net sales were roughly flat with fiscal 2001. Actual net sales increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of Zetec and gains from certain oil & gas control system applications, particularly those sold to Gazprom, partly reduced by lower sales from exiting certain Petrotech businesses in fiscal 2001. The increase in our overall gross profit percentage to 53.6% in fiscal 2002 compared to 52.7% to in fiscal 2001 was mostly due to exiting low margin businesses at Petrotech. This also caused an increase in margins for the industrial controls segment to 53.7% in fiscal 2002 compared to 51.1% in fiscal 2001. Analytical instrumentation gross margins were roughly flat at 56.1% in fiscal 2002 compared to 55.9% in fiscal 2001. Fluid Handlings gross margins decreased to 46.2% in fiscal 2002 compared to 48.4% in fiscal 2001. This decrease was caused mostly by adverse volume leverage in our industrial pumps businesses. Excluding the effects from the accounting change related to goodwill and the restructuring charges expensed in fiscal 2001, selling, general and administrative ("SG&A") expenses increased to 35.3% of net sales in fiscal 2002 compared to 32.8% of sales in fiscal 2001. This increase is attributable to higher SG&A expense levels at newly acquired businesses. SG&A expenses for companies included in all of both 2002 and 2001 declined 2% in 2002 despite significantly increased R&D and other engineering expenses at some of our digital imaging companies. This spending was most notable at Redlake MASD as it continues to develop new products it expects to be available in the 19 second quarter of fiscal 2003. There was also an increase in corporate SG&A due primarily to an increase in medical insurance costs and salaries and related employee relocation costs. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses also increased in 2002 compared to 2001 for each of our three business segments by between 1% and 2%. Interest expense increased $2.6 million, or 16%, for the year ended October 31, 2002 compared to the year ended October 31, 2001. Average borrowing levels were approximately 36% higher during fiscal 2002 compared to the prior year and effective interest rates were approximately 14% lower during fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. Higher borrowing levels in fiscal 2002 were primarily from the September 2001 acquisition of Struers and Logitech and the July 2002 acquisition of Zetec. A euro debt foreign exchange loss of $4.1 million arose from euro denominated debt that was carried in the U.S. and the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar during the third quarter of fiscal 2002. This debt matured near July 31, 2002 and was replaced with U.S. dollar denominated debt. Income taxes were 31% of pretax earnings in fiscal 2002 compared to 35% in fiscal 2001. Two of the key factors related to the reduced rate were the change in accounting for goodwill amortization and our expected utilization of all available foreign income tax credits associated with European tax structures. During fiscal 2002, we completed a transition review for goodwill impairment under SFAS 142 as of November 1, 2001. This review initially compared the fair value of each previously acquired reporting unit to its carrying value. If an impairment was indicated, the amount was then determined by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount. This impairment was reported as a change in accounting principle, was a non cash charge and was related to the Redlake, Petrotech and Dynamco units. At October 31, 2002, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at October 31, 2001. This strengthening resulted in a gain of $13.7 million in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings for fiscal 2002. Approximately $11 million of this adjustment related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our expected future cash flows. Fiscal 2002s operating results also benefited slightly from the stronger non U.S. currencies. The benefits were less than 2% of operating earnings. Foreign exchange differences related to our other non U.S. subsidiaries were immaterial to fiscal 2002s financial information. 20 The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended October 31 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2002 2001 Pro forma Pro forma Actual Pro forma Actual change Analytical Instrumentation $ 314,237 $ 314,237 $ 339,935 $ 260,927 8% Fluid Handling 103,858 103,858 121,231 121,231 14 Industrial Controls 196,933 196,933 207,292 200,681 5 Total $ 615,028 $ 615,028 $ 668,458 $ 582,839 8% Our fluid handling segment was more exposed to poor semiconductor conditions than the other two segments. Semiconductor related sales orders were down significantly in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. Excluding this business, fluid handlings net sales orders decreased 10% in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. The decrease in analytical instrumentation net sales orders was attributed to weak semiconductor , electronics and automotive markets that more than offset the increase in fluid properties testing. Aside from the semiconductor decline, the fluid handling segment decline in net sales orders also reflected the weak oil and gas exploration and power generation markets. A one time supplemental order of $20 million from Gazprom in fiscal 2001 caused unfavorable comparisons in the industrial controls segment. 21 The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at October 31 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2002 2001 Pro forma Pro forma Actual Pro forma Actual change Analytical Instrumentation $ 57,865 $ 57,865 $ 64,126 $ 62,609 10% Fluid Handling 19,799 19,799 21,678 21,678 9 Industrial Controls 35,427 35,427 35,945 31,217 1 Total $ 113,091 $ 113,091 $ 121,749 $ 115,504 7% A significant impact on the decreased sales order backlog at October 31, 2002 compared to October 31, 2001 was the $11.5 million residual one time supplemental Gazprom order which is included in the prior year backlog for industrial controls. Excluding this order, backlog is up 2%. Declines in analytical instrumentation and fluid handling were attributable to weak electronics and oil exploration markets, respectively. Year Ended October 31, 2001 Compared to Year Ended October 31, 2000 Net sales for fiscal 2001 were $586.5 million, a 16% increase compared to fiscal 2000. Excluding sales to Gazprom, net sales increased 14% in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000. Fiscal 2001 pro forma net sales increased 5% compared to pro forma net sales during fiscal 2000. In our analytical instrumentation segment, actual net sales increased 18% in fiscal 2001 and pro forma net sales increased 5%. The increase in actual net sales resulted mostly from the contribution of companies acquired during fiscal 2001 and 2000. The increase in pro forma net sales resulted mostly from strong digital imaging demand from research markets. Weakness in the automobile industry adversely affected sales of our high speed digital camera products and our industrial leak test products. In our fluid handling segment, actual net sales increased 3% in fiscal 2001 and pro forma net sales decreased 7%. Actual net sales increased primarily as the result of companies acquired during fiscal 2001 and 2000. Pro forma net sales decreased primarily as the result of depressed business conditions in the semiconductor industry. This segments pro forma net sales to this industry decreased 33% in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000. Net sales in fiscal 2001 for this segments businesses not serving the semiconductor industry increased 2% compared to pro forma net sales in fiscal 2000. In our industrial controls segment, actual net sales increased 24% and pro forma net sales increased 13%. Actual net sales increased primarily as a result of companies acquired since the beginning of fiscal 2000, increased shipments to Gazprom and higher revenues from customers in energy markets. These increases were partially offset by lower revenues at Petrotech that resulted from restructuring activities that occurred during fiscal 2001. Pro forma net sales increased primarily as a 22 result of additional sales to Gazprom. Sales to Gazprom were $49.3 million during fiscal 2001, or an increase of 45% compared to fiscal 2000. Our overall gross profit percentage increased to 52.7% in fiscal 2001 compared to 51.4% in fiscal 2000. Several factors were the largest contributors to the change. The largest factor was the growth in our Analytical Instrumentation segment, the highest gross margin segment. Other large factors contributing to increased margins were improved leverage on the additional sales to Gazprom and the benefits from exiting certain low margin businesses at Petrotech during 2001. Increased sales from our lower margin refrigeration valves business that was acquired in September 2000 adversely affected margins. Analytical instrumentations gross margin increased to 55.9% in fiscal 2001 compared to 54.4% in fiscal 2000. Most of this improvement resulted from favorable leverage related to increased digital imaging sales and the incremental sales at Struers and Logitech that were at relatively high margins. Fluid handlings gross margin decreased to 48.4% in fiscal 2001 compared to 48.5% in fiscal 2000. This decrease was caused mostly by lower sales of its high margin semiconductor related products. Industrial controls gross margin increased to 51.1% in fiscal 2001 compared to 49.3% in fiscal 2000. This increase was caused primarily by the favorable effects of increased sales to Gazprom and lower sales from exited businesses, and was partially offset by increased sales of lower margin refrigeration valve products. SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2001 and fiscal 2000 are presented in the following table. 2001 2000 Total Adjusted* Total Adjusted* Analytical Instrumentation 39.5% 36.2% 38.0% 34.5% Fluid Handling 26.8 24.5 24.1 22.3 Industrial Controls 31.9 28.5 31.4 29.8 Corporate 1.7 1.7 1.3 1.3 Total 35.9% 32.8% 33.9% 31.3% * Excludes goodwill amortization for fiscal 2001 and 2000 and restructuring charges included in fiscal 2001. The increase in SG&A costs as a percentage of net sales in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 for the fluid handling segment was caused by the adverse leverage that resulted from the quick and deep cyclical decline in the segments semiconductor related business. Other changes in the relationships between SG&A costs and net sales were not considered significant. Interest expense was $15.9 million in fiscal 2001 compared to $13.5 million in fiscal 2000. Interest expense was higher in fiscal 2001 mostly due to the borrowings associated with the acquisitions that occurred since the beginning of fiscal 2000. All of these acquisitions, representing total costs of over $330 million during these two fiscal years, were paid for with cash provided by our then existing credit facilities. Short term interest rates started to decline dramatically early in calendar 2001. The effective interest rate was approximately 6.5% during fiscal 2001 compared to approximately 6.9% during fiscal 2000. 23 The provision for income taxes was 35.4% of pretax earnings in fiscal 2001 compared to 35.1% in fiscal 2000. This change was not considered significant. The other components of comprehensive earnings in fiscal 2001 were currency translation adjustments resulting from net assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These net assets were primarily denominated in euros, British pounds, Danish krone or Japanese yen. During fiscal 2001, the U.S. dollar weakened against the euro, was relatively stable against the pound and strengthened against the yen and krone (after the acquisition of Danish assets in September 2001). During fiscal 2001, our consolidated net assets increased $1.2 million due to foreign currency translation adjustments. The following table summarizes net sales order information for the years ended October 31 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2001 2000 Pro forma Pro forma Actual Pro forma Actual change Analytical Instrumentation $ 260,927 $ 260,927 $ 273,105 $ 239,903 4% Fluid Handling 121,231 121,231 142,858 128,925 15 Industrial Controls 195,073 200,681 170,267 160,136 +15 Total $ 577,231 $ 582,839 $ 586,230 $ 528,964 2% The decrease in analytical instrumentations pro forma net sales orders in fiscal 2001 compared to fiscal 2000 was broad based. Net sales orders for each major product group declined from 2% 9%. This segments businesses were adversely affected by poor market conditions in the automotive and semiconductor industries. The decrease in pro forma net sales orders for the fluid handling segment was caused largely by a decline in semiconductor related orders. The increase in pro forma net sales orders for the industrial controls segment was caused primarily by additional orders from Gazprom. The following table summarizes our sales order backlog information at October 31 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2001 2000 Pro forma Pro forma Actual Pro forma Actual change Analytical Instrumentation $ 62,609 $ 62,609 $ 68,092 $ 54,550 8% Fluid Handling 21,678 21,678 26,073 26,073 17 Industrial Controls 31,217 31,217 25,166 29,246 +24 Total $ 115,504 $ 115,504 $ 119,331 $ 109,869 3% Changes in sales order backlog were consistent with changes in net sales orders. 24 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $87.0 million in fiscal 2002, $102.4 million in fiscal 2001 and $67.6 million during fiscal 2000. Most of this decrease in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was attributed to the one time supplemental order for Gazprom, partially offset by improved cash generation from assets. Cash flows from investing activities during each of fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000 were mostly business acquisition costs. Cash flows from financing activities during each of these years were mostly the borrowing activities associated with the business acquisitions and the debt reductions from our other net positive cash flows. Financing activities in fiscal 2000 also included refinancing our then existing $200 million credit agreement with our current $275 million credit facility and the issuance of $125 million of senior notes. Total current assets, excluding cash, exceeded total current liabilities, excluding debt, by $125.5 million at October 31, 2002 compared to $115.6 million at October 31, 2001. We acquired approximately $10 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during fiscal 2002. We also financed a $20 million one time supplemental order for Gazprom. Working capital was otherwise reduced by approximately $20 million during fiscal 2002 due to improved management of our accounts receivable, inventories and payables. Total debt was $332.1 million at October 31, 2002 (47% of total capital) compared to $326.8 million at October 31, 2001 (50% of total capital). Our increased debt at October 31, 2002 compared to that a year ago was due to the borrowings incurred to fund fiscal 2002 business acquisitions in excess of cash generated by existing operations. Our principal $275 million credit facility with a group of banks provides most of our daily external financing requirements, consisting of revolving loans, swing line loans and letters of credit. At October 31, 2002, utilization of this facility included $144.7 million of U.S. denominated borrowings, the equivalent of $41.7 million of non U.S. denominated borrowings and $3.3 million of outstanding letters of credit. Total unused availability under this facility was $85.3 million at October 31, 2002. We expect that our available additional borrowing capacity combined with the cash flows expected to be generated from existing business will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance some additional acquisitions. This facility matures May 2005. We also have several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non U.S. businesses. In total, these smaller facilities do not represent a significant source of credit for us. Our outstanding indebtedness at October 31, 2002 also included $125 million of term notes maturing in May 2007 and May 2010 and do not require sinking fund payments. We may prepay the notes by paying the holders thereof the discounted present value of all remaining scheduled payments using a discount rate equal to the sum of 50 basis points plus the yield of the U.S. Treasury Notes corresponding to the then remaining average life of the notes being prepaid. Capital expenditures of $7.8 million, $7.5 million and $15.2 million were incurred during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 to be comparable as a percentage of sales to the past two years. 25 In November 2002, Ropers Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend paid on our outstanding common stock to $0.0875 per share from $0.0825 per share, an increase of 6%. This represents the tenth consecutive year in which the quarterly dividend has been increased since Ropers 1992 initial public offering. Our board of directors has declared a dividend payable on January 31, 2003. Payment of any additional dividends requires further action by the board of directors. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following table quantifies our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at October 31, 2002 (dollars in thousands). Payments Due in Fiscal Contractual Cash Obligations Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Long term debt $332,105 $20,515 $ 135 $186,455 $ 0 $40,000 $85,000 Operating Leases 38,900 8,900 6,800 4,900 3,600 2,800 11,900 Total $371,005 $29,415 6,935 191,355 3,600 42,800 96,900 Amounts Expiring in Fiscal Total Other Commercial Amount Commitments Committed 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Standby letters of credit $ 3,336 $ 3,336 Total $ 3,336 $ 3,336 $ At October 31, 2002 and 2001, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. 26 We anticipate that our recently acquired companies as well as our other companies will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a pace consistent with that which has historically been experienced. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during fiscal 2003 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies; and none of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards The Financial Accounting Standards Board ("FASB") issued SFAS 143 "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations" that Roper is required to adopt by November 1, 2002. Roper does not currently have, nor is it expected to have, any material asset retirement obligations subject to this new standard. The FASB issued SFAS 144 "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets" that Roper is required to adopt by November 1, 2002. This new standard does not apply to goodwill. Roper does not expect the adoption of this standard to result in an impairment charge. The FASB issued SFAS 145 that rescinded, amended or made technical corrections to several previously issued statements. None of these changes are expected to significantly affect Ropers accounting or financial reporting practices. The FASB issued SFAS 146 "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities" that Roper is required to adopt for applicable transactions after December 31, 2002. This standard modifies the timing of when certain costs are reported. 27 Outlook We currently expect sales and net income for fiscal 2003 to be higher than for fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2003 is expected to benefit from the full year contributions from the businesses acquired during fiscal 2002, especially Zetec, from additional efforts to make our companies more efficient, and from reduced interest expense resulting from paying down our debt. The conditions in the semiconductor industry are currently poor and we do not expect any meaningful recovery in this industry during fiscal 2003. The overall economic conditions of the U.S.A. and Europe are sluggish and both the Federal Reserve Board and the European Central Bank recently lowered discount rates yet again in an effort to stimulate the respective economies. There continue to be terrorist threats against the U.S. and its allies and also the possibility of military action against Iraq. A significant terrorist attack or military action against Iraq could cause changes in world economies that would adversely affect us. It is impossible to isolate each of these factors effects on current economic conditions. It is also impossible to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty what or when any additional events may occur that also will similarly disrupt the economy. We expect to continue an active acquisition program. However, completion of future acquisitions and their impact on ours results or financial condition cannot be accurately predicted. Information About Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In addition, we, or our executive officers on our behalf, may from time to time make forward looking statements in reports and other documents we file with the SEC or in connection with oral statements made to the press, potential investors or others. Statements that are not historical facts, including statements about our beliefs and expectations, are forward looking statements. Forward looking statements include statements preceded by, followed by or that include the words, "believes," "expects," "anticipates," "plans," "estimates" or similar expressions. These statements include, among others, statements regarding our expected business outlook, anticipated financial and operating results, strategies, contingencies, financing plans, working capital needs, sources of liquidity, capital expenditures and contemplated acquisitions. Forward looking statements are only predictions and are not guarantees of performance. These statements are based on beliefs and assumptions of our management, which in turn are based on currently available information. Important assumptions relating to the forward looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding demand for our products, expected pricing levels, parts and components costs, the timing and cost of planned capital expenditures, the estimated cost of environmental compliance, expected outcomes of pending litigation, competitive conditions and general economic conditions. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. The forward looking statements also involve risks and uncertainties, which could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement. Many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict. Such factors include, but are not limited to, the following: o reductions in our business with Gazprom; 28 o unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates; o difficulties associated with exports; o risks associated with our international operations; o difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses; o increased product liability and insurance costs o increased warranty exposure; o the fact that our former independent auditors, Arthur Andersen LLP has ceased operations as described in the Notice filed as Exhibit 23.2 to this Annual Report; o future competition; o changes in the supply of, or price for, parts and components; o environmental compliance costs and liabilities; o risks and costs associated with asbestos related litigation; o potential write offs of our substantial intangible assets; and o the factors discussed in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report under the heading "Risk Factors." We believe these forward looking statements are reasonable; however, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Further, forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events. 29 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on its outstanding borrowings. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At October 31, 2002, we had a combination of fixed rate borrowings (primarily $125 million of term notes) and relatively variable rate borrowings (primarily borrowings under the $275 million credit facility). Although each borrowing under the $275 million credit facility has a fixed rate, the terms of these individual borrowings are generally only 1 3 months. At October 31, 2002, prevailing market interest rates were lower than the fixed rates on the term notes by 2 3 percentage points. This resulted in the estimated fair values of the term notes using a discounted cash flows model being greater than the face amounts of the notes by an estimated $15.6 million and it represented an unrecorded decrease in our net assets at October 31, 2002. There was a comparable unrecorded decrease in our net assets of $11.7 million at October 31, 2001. If interest rates had been 1% higher at October 31, 2002, the difference between the fair values of the term notes and their face values would have been approximately $7.1 million smaller. These interest rate differences do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. At October 31, 2002, Ropers outstanding variable rate borrowings under the $275 million credit facility were $186.4 million. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $1.9 million. Several Roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, British pounds, Danish krone or Japanese yen. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 28% of our total sales and 80% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar weakened against these European currencies during fiscal 2002 and was relatively stable compared to other currencies. The difference between fiscal 2002s operating results for these companies translated into U.S. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal 2002 and these operating results translated into U.S. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal 2001 was not material. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout fiscal 2002 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately $2 million. The changes of these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2002 compared to currency exchange rates at October 31, 2001 resulted in an increase in net assets of $13.7 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $10.9 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. 30 The trading price of Ropers common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial statements. The stock prices also influence the computation of the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.
