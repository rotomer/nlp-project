ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with Selection Financial Information and our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. During the first quarter of fiscal 2003, the Company decided to offer for sale the Petrotech operation. The accompanying financial statements have been restated to conform to discontinued operations treatment for all periods presented. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. A discussion of our significant accounting policies can be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended October 31, 2002 included elsewhere in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long lived assets, recognizing revenues and issuing stock options to employees. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements, except for the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets as discussed below. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory utilization, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percent of completion), income taxes and goodwill analysis. These issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases, credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At October 31, 2002, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, sales returns and sales credits was $3.6 million, or 3% of total gross accounts receivable excluding $15.3 million of securitized Gazprom receivables from a vendor financing program. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables. During 2002, that profile improved with the acquisition of Zetec and other improvements in collections from core businesses, and the allowance was reduced as a percent of net sales by 50 basis points. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. Business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances. At October 31, 2002, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $19.2 million, or 18% of gross first in, first out inventory cost. This percentage has increased by 390 basis points over the year as the relative age of inventory increased during the cyclical downturn. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. At October 31, 2002, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $3.4 million or 0.5% of annualized fourth quarter fiscal 2002 sales. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the three years ended October 31, 2002. Revenues related to the use of the percentage of completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, we recognized revenue of approximately $2.4 million, $2.3 million and $1.7 million, respectively using this method. In addition, approximately $7.9 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage of completion contracts had yet to be recognized at October 31, 2002. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During fiscal 2002, our effective income tax rate was reduced to 31% from 34%. Two of the key factors related to the reduced rate were our expected utilization of all available foreign income tax credits and the accounting change related to goodwill amortization that was expensed for book purposes prior to the adoption of SFAS 142 but not deductible for income tax purposes. We adopted SFAS No. 142 effective November 1, 2001 the beginning of our fiscal 2002. SFAS 142, issued in June 2001, requires the adoption of its provisions by the beginning of our fiscal 2003, but the timing of our fiscal year end also allowed it to elect to adopt SFAS 142 at the beginning of fiscal 2002. Based primarily on investor interest to see results reflecting adoption of SFAS 142, we elected to adopt this new standard at the earlier date. The evaluation of goodwill under SFAS 142 requires valuations of each applicable underlying business. These valuations can be significantly affected by estimates of future performance and discount rates over a relatively long period of time, market price valuation multiples and marketplace transactions in related markets. These estimates will likely change over time. Some of our businesses operate in cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality. The transitional business valuation reviews required by SFAS 142 indicated a reduction of the carrying value of goodwill for three business units (Redlake, Petrotech and Dynamco). This goodwill reduction has been reported as a change in accounting principle retroactive to the beginning of fiscal 2002 and resulted in a transitional charge to earnings of approximately $26 million. After the adoption of SFAS 142, goodwill is required to be evaluated annually. If this annual review indicates further impairment of goodwill balances, that entire impairment will be recorded immediately and reported as a component of current operations. Our acquisitions have generally included a large goodwill component and we expect this to continue with future acquisitions. Prior to adopting SFAS 142, goodwill was amortized over periods not exceeding 40 years. With the adoption of this standard, goodwill is not amortized. It is periodically reviewed for impairment as discussed above. SFAS 142 does not permit retroactive application to years prior to adoption. Therefore, earnings beginning in fiscal 2002 tend to be higher than earlier periods as a result of this accounting change, except for the effects of any impairment provision on current results. Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements includes a reconciliation comparing earnings of pre adoption periods to earnings of current periods for those periods presented. Goodwill amortization prior to the adoption of SFAS 142 was largest in the Instrumentation segment and the amount of goodwill currently recorded is also largest for this segment. We believe it inappropriate to conclude whether the likelihood of any impairment charge resulting from subsequent annual reviews is more likely in any business segment compared to another segment. At October 31, 2002, Ropers total assets included $459.2 million of goodwill. Goodwill was allocated $198.0 million to our Instrumentation segment, $76.7 million to our Industrial Technology segment, $78.9 million to our Energy Systems and Controls segment and $105.6 million to our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment. Total goodwill was allocated to 22 different business units with individual amounts ranging from less than $1 million to approximately $78 million. Results of Operations General The following tables set forth selected information for the years indicated. Dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales. Year ended October 31, 2002 2001 2000 Net sales Instrumentation(1) $ 175,490 $ 125,354 $ 111,789 Industrial Technology(2) 164,160 170,822 131,251 Energy Systems and Controls(3) 126,709 107,043 86,582 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 151,103 159,736 140,377 Total $ 617,462 $ 562,955 $ 469,999 Gross profit: Instrumentation 58.6 % 58.4 % 56.1 % Industrial Technology 46.2 46.8 47.7 Energy Systems and Controls 59.8 62.8 61.7 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 52.3 52.8 52.5 Total 54.1 54.1 53.7 Operating profit: Instrumentation 18.7 % 20.8 % 25.3 % Industrial Technology 22.8 24.0 24.1 Energy Systems and Controls 26.1 26.4 24.5 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 17.1 19.1 18.7 Total 20.9 22.4 22.9 Goodwill amortization (2.7 )% (2.6 )% Corporate administrative expenses (2.2 ) (1.7 ) (1.4 ) Restructuring charges(4) (0.1 ) Income from continuing operations 18.7 17.9 18.9 Interest expense (3.0 ) (2.8 ) (2.9 ) Euro debt currency exchange loss (0.7 ) Other income 0.5 0.7 0.3 Income from continuing operations before taxes and change in accounting principle 15.6 15.8 16.3 Income taxes (4.8 ) (5.6 ) (5.7 ) Loss on discontinued operations, net of taxes (0.1 ) (0.3 ) (0.1 ) Goodwill adjustment effective November 1, 2001, net of taxes (4.2 ) Net earnings 6.5 % 9.9 % 10.5 % (1) Includes results of Antek Instruments from August 2000, Struers and Logitech from September 2001 and several smaller businesses acquired during the years presented. (2) Includes results of Abel Pump from May 2000, Hansen Technologies from September 2000 and several smaller businesses acquired during the years presented. (3) Includes results of Zetec from August 2002 and several smaller businesses acquired during the years presented. (4) Restructuring charges were $180,000, $279,000 and $50,000 in Industrial Technology, Instrumentation, and Scientific and Industrial Imaging, respectively. Year Ended October 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended October 31, 2001 Net sales for fiscal 2002 were $617.5 million as compared to sales of $563.0 million in fiscal 2001, an increase of 9.7%. $87.8 million of the sales increase was attributable to acquisitions during fiscal 2002 (Zetec, QImaging, Duncan Technologies, Definitive Imaging and AI Qualitek) and the full year impact of acquisitions made during fiscal 2001 (Struers, Logitech, Media Cybernetics and Dynamco). Excluding this impact net sales declined by 2.7% (to $529.7 million) primarily attributable to declines in the semiconductor market and the downturn in oil and gas exploration and certain industrial markets. The impact of these difficult market conditions was somewhat mitigated by a 15% increase in sales to Gazprom and an 8% increase in sales in our fluid properties testing businesses as their products help customers respond to stricter environmental controls regarding sulfur content in petroleum products. In our Instrumentation segment, fiscal 2002 net sales increased by $50.1 million or 40% over fiscal 2001. The increase was primarily attributable to a year on year sales increase of $64.6 million from acquisitions (AI Qualitek acquired in fiscal 2002 and the full year impact of our fiscal 2001 acquisitions Struers and Logitech). Excluding this impact of acquisitions, net sales declined 0.6% (to $110.9 million) as a result of severely depressed business conditions in semiconductor markets. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment declined by $6.7 million or 3.9% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002, primarily from weakness in industrial pump and oil & gas exploration markets. The full year impact of the fiscal 2001 acquisition of Dynamco slightly mitigated this decrease. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales increased by $19.7 million or 18.4% with $13.1 million of the increase being attributable to the fiscal 2002 acquisition of Zetec. Excluding the impact of Zetec, net sales increased 6.1% (to $113.6 million) due to gains in sales of oil & gas control system applications, including those sold to Gazprom. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported a decrease in net sales in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 of $8.6 million or 5.4%. The decrease resulted principally from lower motion product sales due to the pending release of a new generation of products that we anticipate to begin shipping during the first half of fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2002 acquisitions (QImaging, Definitive Imaging and Duncan Technologies) and the full year increase of a fiscal 2001 acquisition (Media Cybernetics) mitigated the decline by $8.8 million. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions net sales declined by 11.1% (to $139.2 million). Our overall gross profit percentage was 54.1% in fiscal 2002 and the same as in fiscal 2001. Instrumentation segment gross margins were roughly flat in fiscal 2002 at 58.6% as compared to 58.4% in fiscal 2001. Industrial Technology gross margins decreased to 46.2% in fiscal 2002 as compared to 46.8% in fiscal 2001 as a result of adverse volume leverage in our industrial pumps businesses. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment reported margins of 59.8% in fiscal 2002 as compared to 62.8% in fiscal 2001, attributable to lower gross margins at Zetec as compared to the segment average. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segments gross margins were 52.3% in fiscal 2002 as compared to 52.8% in fiscal 2001 as margins declined for motion imaging equipment with the significant reduction in sales. Excluding the effects from the accounting changes related to goodwill and the related amortization charges expensed in fiscal 2001 of $15.3 million, selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses increased to 35.2% of net sales in fiscal 2002 from 33.5% of net sales in fiscal 2001. This increase is attributable to higher SG&A expense levels at newly acquired businesses. SG&A expenses for companies included in all of both 2002 and 2001 declined 2% in 2002 despite significantly increased R&D and other engineering expenses in our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment, most notably Redlake MASD. There was also an increase in corporate SG&A due primarily to an increase in medical insurance costs and salaries and related employee relocation costs. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses also increased in 2002 compared to 2001 for each of our four business segments by between 1% and 2%. Interest expense increased $2.6 million, or 16%, for the year ended October 31, 2002 compared to the year ended October 31, 2001. Average borrowing levels were approximately 36% higher during fiscal 2002 compared to the prior year due to acquisitions and effective interest rates were approximately 14% lower during fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. A euro debt foreign exchange loss of $4.1 million arose from euro denominated debt that was carried in the U.S. and the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar during the third quarter of fiscal 2002. This debt matured near July 31, 2002 and was replaced with U.S. dollar denominated debt. Income taxes were 31% of pretax earnings in fiscal 2002 compared to 35% in fiscal 2001. Two of the key factors related to the reduced rate were the change in accounting for goodwill amortization and our expected utilization of all available foreign income tax credits associated with European tax structures. During fiscal 2002, we completed a transition review for goodwill impairment under SFAS 142 as of November 1, 2001. This review initially compared the fair value of each previously acquired reporting unit to its carrying value. If an impairment was indicated, the amount was then determined by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount. This impairment was reported as a change in accounting principle, was a non cash charge and was related to the Redlake, Petrotech and Dynamco units. At October 31, 2002, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at October 31, 2001. This strengthening resulted in a gain of $13.7 million in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings for fiscal 2002. Approximately $11 million of this adjustment related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our expected future cash flows. Fiscal 2002s operating results also benefited slightly from the stronger non U.S. currencies. The benefits were less than 2% of operating earnings. Foreign exchange differences related to our other non U.S. subsidiaries were immaterial to fiscal 2002s financial information. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended October 31 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2002 2001 change Instrumentation $ 168,350 $ 118,481 42 % Industrial Technology 161,632 171,550 6 Energy Systems and Controls 123,038 119,137 3 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 153,349 157,096 2 Total $ 606,369 $ 566,264 7 % Instrumentation segment net orders improved due largely to 2001 and 2002 acquisitions and higher orders for oil and gas desulfurization applications, offset somewhat by lower orders for semiconductor capital equipment markets. Industrial Technology segment net orders declined on weak industrial and oil and gas exploration markets. Energy Systems and Controls net orders rose because of higher demand for the Companys turbomachinery control systems, as well as the 2002 acquisition of Zetec, with the year to year comparison adversely affected by a $20 million supplemental order from Gazprom in 2001. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders fell as the benefit from 2002 and 2001 acquisitions was more than offset by weak semiconductor markets and lower motion product activity. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at October 31 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2002 2001 change Instrumentation $ 17,751 $ 25,155 29% Industrial Technology 24,122 26,608 9 Energy Systems and Controls 23,985 21,928 9 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 40,732 38,100 7 Total $ 106,590 $ 111,791 5% A significant impact on the decreased sales order backlog at October 31, 2002 compared to October 31, 2001 was the $11.5 million residual one time supplemental Gazprom order which is included in the prior year backlog for Energy Systems and Controls. Excluding this order, total Company backlog increased 6% from $100.3 million to $106.6 million. Declines in Instrumentation and Industrial Technology were attributable to weak semiconductor and oil exploration markets, respectively. Year Ended October 31, 2001 Compared to Year Ended October 31, 2000 Net sales for fiscal 2001 were $563.0 million, a $93.0 million or 19.8% increase compared to fiscal 2000 net sales of $470.0 million. Acquisitions made during fiscal 2001 and the full year contribution from fiscal 2000 acquisitions contributed $66.3 million of the increase in net sales. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, net sales increased by $26.7 million, or 6.8%, with $15.6 million of the increase attributable to higher net sales to our largest customer, Gazprom. Part of this increase arose from a special vendor financing program instituted to fund exceptional sales levels. Our Instrumentation segment reported net sales of $125.4 million, a $13.6 million or 12.1% increase over fiscal 2000 net sales of $111.8 million. Acquisitions made during 2001 (Struers and Logitech) and the full year impact of fiscal 2000 acquisitions (Antek and Cybor) contributed $25.6 million of this increase. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, net sales were 12.0% lower in fiscal 2001 than in fiscal 2000 ($88.3 million in 2001 from $100.3 million in 2000) as a result of the depressed business conditions in semiconductor markets that impacted our integrated dispense systems sales and weak automobile markets that impacted demand for our industrial leak test products. In our Industrial Technology segment net sales of $170.8 million in fiscal 2001 were $39.6 million or 30.1% higher than in fiscal 2000 net sales of $131.2 million. Acquisitions during fiscal 2001 (Dynamco) and the full year contribution from fiscal 2000 acquisitions (Abel Pump, Flow Data and Hansen Technologies) provided $35.7 million of this increase. Excluding the effect of acquisitions, net sales increased by $3.9 million or 3.3% (from $116.2 million to $120.1 million). The segment saw gains in most areas except certain industrial pump markets. Our Energy Systems & Controls segment reported net sales of $107.0 million in fiscal 2001, a $20.5 million or 23.6% increase over fiscal 2000 net sales of $86.6 million. Increased sales to Gazprom were the principal cause of this increase. Net sales of our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment increased to $159.7 million in fiscal 2001, a $19.4 million or 13.8% increase over fiscal 2000 net sales of $140.4 million. Acquisitions made during 2001 (Media Cybernetics) and the full year impact of fiscal 2000 acquisitions (Redlake, MASD and Oxford EM) contributed $1.3 million to this increase. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, net sales increased 20.3% from $89.1 million to $107.2 million as a result of strong demand in research markets, particularly for our Transmission Electron Microscopy products. Our overall gross profit percentage increased to 54.1% in fiscal 2001 from 53.7% in fiscal 2000. Many of our businesses reported improved margins during the year, most significantly from those businesses with improved leverage from additional sales. Our Instrumentation segment reported an increase in gross profit margins from 56.1% in fiscal 2000 to 58.4% in fiscal 2001 as a result of incremental sales at Struers and Logitech that were at relatively high margins. Industrial Technology segment gross profit margins declined from 47.7% in fiscal 2000 to 46.8% in fiscal 2000. This decrease was caused mostly by increased sales from our lower gross margin refrigeration valves business that was acquired in September 2000. The Energy Systems & Controls segment gross profit margins increased from 61.7% to 62.8% primarily as a result of increased business levels with Gazprom. Scientific and Industrial Imaging gross profit margins increased from 52.5% in fiscal 2000 to 52.8% in fiscal 2001 primarily as a result of favorable leverage related to increased sales into certain research markets. SG&A expenses, excluding goodwill amortization and corporate administrative expenses were 31.8% of net sales in fiscal 2001 as compared to 30.9% of net sales in fiscal 2000. The increase arose solely from increases in the Instrumentation segment which more than offset improvements in cost structures in the other three segments. The increases in SG&A expenses as a percentage of net sales for the Instrumentation segment increased from 30.9% in fiscal 2000 to 37.7% in fiscal 2001 as a result of the quick and deep cyclical decline in the segments semiconductor related business, higher SG&A expense levels at the fiscal 2001 acquisitions (Struers and Logitech) and additional research and development expenditures. Interest expense was $15.9 million in fiscal 2001 compared to $13.5 million in fiscal 2000. Interest expense was higher in fiscal 2001 mostly due to the borrowings associated with the acquisitions that occurred since the beginning of fiscal 2000. All of these acquisitions, representing total costs of over $330 million during these two fiscal years, were paid for with cash provided by our then existing credit facilities. Short term interest rates started to decline dramatically early in calendar 2001. The effective interest rate was approximately 6.5% during fiscal 2001 compared to approximately 6.9% during fiscal 2000. The provision for income taxes was 35.4% of pretax earnings in fiscal 2001 compared to 35.1% in fiscal 2000. This change was not considered significant. The other components of comprehensive earnings in fiscal 2001 were currency translation adjustments resulting from net assets denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These net assets were primarily denominated in euros, British pounds, Danish krone or Japanese yen. During fiscal 2001, the U.S. dollar weakened against the euro, was relatively stable against the pound and strengthened against the yen and krone (after the acquisition of Danish assets in September 2001). During fiscal 2001, our consolidated net assets increased $1.2 million due to foreign currency translation adjustments. The following table summarizes net sales order information for the years ended October 31 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2001 2000 change Instrumentation $ 118,481 $ 117,986 0 % Industrial Technology 171,550 137,712 25 Energy Systems and Controls 119,137 83,274 43 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 157,096 154,178 2 Total $ 566,264 $ 493,150 15 % Net order gains in the Instrumentation segment from 2001 and 2000 acquisitions were offset by the sudden, severe downturn in the semiconductor capital equipment markets. Acquisitions in 2001 and 2000 benefited the Industrial Technology segment, which also experienced a decline in orders for directional drilling relating to fiber optic cable placements in North America. Strong demand for turbomachinery controls, including a large increase in orders from Gazprom, coupled with a small 2000 acquisition, drove the increase in net orders in the Energy Systems and Controls segment. In the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment, a strong increase in demand for electron microscopy products and solutions was mostly countered by a slowdown in motion imaging. The following table summarizes our sales order backlog information at October 31 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2001 2000 change Instrumentation $ 25,155 $ 16,875 49 % Industrial Technology 26,608 27,589 4 Energy Systems and Controls 21,928 9,796 124 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 38,100 44,359 14 Total $ 111,791 $ 98,619 13 % Changes in sales order backlog were consistent with changes in net sales orders. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $86.8 million in fiscal 2002, $102.4 million in fiscal 2001 and $67.8 million during fiscal 2000. Most of this decrease in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was attributed to the one time supplemental order for Gazprom, partially offset by improved cash generation from assets. Cash flows from investing activities during each of fiscal 2002, 2001, and 2000 were mostly business acquisition costs. Cash flows from financing activities during each of these years were mostly the borrowing activities associated with the business acquisitions and the debt reductions from our other net positive cash flows. Financing activities in fiscal 2000 also included refinancing our then existing $200 million credit agreement with our current $275 million credit facility and the issuance of $125 million of senior notes. Total current assets, excluding cash, exceeded total current liabilities, excluding debt, by $126.7 million at October 31, 2002 compared to $122.6 million at October 31, 2001. We acquired approximately $10 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during fiscal 2002. We also financed a $20 million one time supplemental order for Gazprom. Working capital was otherwise reduced by approximately $20 million during fiscal 2002 due to improved management of our accounts receivable, inventories and payables. Total debt was $332.1 million at October 31, 2002 (47% of total capital) compared to $326.8 million at October 31, 2001 (50% of total capital). Our increased debt at October 31, 2002 compared to a year ago was due to the borrowings incurred to fund fiscal 2002 business acquisitions in excess of cash generated by existing operations. Our principal $275 million credit facility with a group of banks provides most of our daily external financing requirements, consisting of revolving loans, swing line loans and letters of credit. At October 31, 2002, utilization of this facility included $144.7 million of U.S. denominated borrowings, the equivalent of $41.7 million of non U.S. denominated borrowings and $3.3 million of outstanding letters of credit. Total unused availability under this facility was $85.3 million at October 31, 2002. We expect that our available additional borrowing capacity combined with the cash flows expected to be generated from existing business will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance some additional acquisitions. This facility matures May 2005. We also have several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non U.S. businesses. In total, these smaller facilities do not represent a significant source of credit for us. Our outstanding indebtedness at October 31, 2002 also included $125 million of term notes maturing in May 2007 and May 2010 and do not require sinking fund payments. We may prepay the notes by paying the holders thereof the discounted present value of all remaining scheduled payments using a discount rate equal to the sum of 50 basis points plus the yield of the U.S. Treasury Notes corresponding to the then remaining average life of the notes being prepaid. The company was in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended October 31, 2002. Capital expenditures of $7.7 million, $7.4 million and $14.9 million were incurred during fiscal 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2003 to be comparable as a percentage of sales to the past two years. In November 2002, Ropers Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend paid on our outstanding common stock to $0.0875 per share from $0.0825 per share, an increase of 6%. This represents the tenth consecutive year in which the quarterly dividend has been increased since Ropers 1992 initial public offering. Our board of directors has declared a dividend payable on January 31, 2003. Payment of any additional dividends requires further action by the board of directors. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following table quantifies our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at October 31, 2002 (dollars in thousands). Contractual Cash Obligations Payments Due in Fiscal Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Long term debt $ 332,105 $ 20,515 $ 135 $ 186,455 $ 0 $ 40,000 $ 85,000 Operating Leases 38,000 8,600 6,600 4,800 3,400 2,700 11,900 Total $ 370,105 $ 29,115 $ 6,735 $ 191,255 $ 3,400 $ 42,700 $ 96,900 Other Commercial Commitments Amounts Expiring in Fiscal Total Amount Committed 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter Standby letters of credit $ 3,075 $ 3,075 At October 31, 2002 and 2001, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our recently acquired companies as well as our other companies will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a pace consistent with that which has historically been experienced. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during fiscal 2003 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies; and none of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations that Roper is required to adopt by November 1, 2002. Roper does not currently have, nor is it expected to have, any material asset retirement obligations subject to this new standard. The FASB issued SFAS 144 Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets that Roper is required to adopt by November 1, 2002. This new standard does not apply to goodwill. The adoption of this standard did not result in an impairment charge. The FASB issued SFAS 145 that rescinded, amended or made technical corrections to several previously issued statements. None of these changes significantly affected Ropers accounting or financial reporting practices. The FASB issued SFAS 146 Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities that Roper is required to adopt for applicable transactions after December 31, 2002. This standard modifies the timing of when certain costs are reported. The Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others as of January 1, 2003. This Interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The Company has no new guarantees after October 31, 2002 requiring the measurement provisions of this Interpretation. The FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (VIEs) that is an Interpretation of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements. This Interpretation addresses the consolidation requirements of business enterprises which have variable interest entities. IN 46 applies immediately to VIEs created after January 31, 2003, and to VIEs in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period ending after December 15, 2003 to VIEs in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before February 1, 2003. Roper is in the process of assessing the implications of this new statement for the company. The FASB issued SFAS 148 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure that amends SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends certain disclosure requirements of Statement 123. Currently, Roper has chosen not to adopt the accounting provisions of SFAS 123 and adopted the additional disclosure provisions of SFAS 148 during 2003. The FASB deferred issuance of SFAS 150 Accounting for Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Liabilities, Equity, or Both, on October 29, 2003, that clarifies liability or equity classification for different financial instruments including mandatorily redeemable shares, put options and forward purchase contracts, and obligations that can be settled with shares. The Company is assessing the impact of this new statement to its financial statements. Outlook We currently expect sales and net income for fiscal 2003 to be higher than for fiscal 2002. Fiscal 2003 is expected to benefit from the full year contributions from the businesses acquired during fiscal 2002, especially Zetec, from additional efforts to make our companies more efficient, and from reduced interest expense resulting from paying down our debt. The conditions in the semiconductor industry are currently poor and we do not expect any meaningful recovery in this industry during fiscal 2003. The overall economic conditions of the U.S.A. and Europe are sluggish and both the Federal Reserve Board and the European Central Bank recently lowered discount rates yet again in an effort to stimulate the respective economies. A significant terrorist attack could cause changes in world economies that would adversely affect us. It is impossible to isolate each of these factors effects on current economic conditions. It is also impossible to predict with any reasonable degree of certainty what or when any additional events may occur that also will similarly disrupt the economy. We expect to continue an active acquisition program. However, completion of future acquisitions and their impact on our results or financial condition cannot be accurately predicted. Information About Forward Looking Statements This report contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In addition, we, or our executive officers on our behalf, may from time to time make forward looking statements in reports and other documents we file with the SEC or in connection with oral statements made to the press, potential investors or others. All statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements. The words estimate, project, intend, expect, believe, anticipate, and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our expected financial position, business, financing plans, business strategy, business prospects, revenues, working capital, liquidity, capital needs, interest costs and income, in each case relating to our company as a whole, as well as statements regarding acquisitions, potential acquisitions and the benefits of acquisitions, including with respect to the Neptune acquisition. Forward looking statements are estimates and projections reflecting our best judgment and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements. These statements are based on our managements beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. Important assumptions relating to the forward looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding demand for our products, the cost, timing and success of product upgrades and new product introductions, raw materials costs, expected pricing levels, the timing and cost of expected capital expenditures, expected outcomes of pending litigation, competitive conditions, general economic conditions and expected synergies relating to acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. Although we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable, our expectations may prove to be incorrect. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in the forward looking statements include: completion of the Neptune acquisition; if completed, our ability to integrate Neptune into our operations; the terms and conditions pursuant to which we are able to finance the Neptune acquisition; reductions in our business with Gazprom; unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates; difficulties associated with exports; risks and costs associated with our international sales and operations; difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses; increased product liability and insurance costs; increased directors and officers liability and other insurance costs; product liability and insurance risks; increased warranty exposure; future competition; changes in the supply of, or price for, parts and components; environmental compliance costs and liabilities; risks and costs associated with asbestos related litigation; potential write offs of our substantial intangible assets; terrorist attacks; and the factors discussed in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report under the heading "Risk Factors." We believe these forward looking statements are reasonable; however, undue reliance should not be placed on any forward looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Further, forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings. We are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At October 31, 2002, we had a combination of fixed rate borrowings (primarily $125 million of term notes) and relatively variable rate borrowings (primarily borrowings under the $275 million credit facility). Although each borrowing under the $275 million credit facility has a fixed rate, the terms of these individual borrowings are generally only 1 3 months. At October 31, 2002, prevailing market interest rates were lower than the fixed rates on the term notes by 2 3 percentage points. This resulted in the estimated fair values of the term notes using a discounted cash flows model being greater than the face amounts of the notes by an estimated $15.6 million and it represented an unrecorded decrease in our net assets at October 31, 2002. There was a comparable unrecorded decrease in our net assets of $11.7 million at October 31, 2001. If interest rates had been 1% higher at October 31, 2002, the difference between the fair values of the term notes and their face values would have been approximately $7.1 million smaller. These interest rate differences do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. At October 31, 2002, Ropers outstanding variable rate borrowings under the $275 million credit facility were $186.4 million. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $1.9 million. Several Roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, British pounds, Danish krone or Japanese yen. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 28% of our total sales and 80% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar weakened against these European currencies during fiscal 2002 and was relatively stable compared to other currencies. The difference between fiscal 2002s operating results for these companies translated into U.S. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal 2002 and these operating results translated into U.S. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal 2001 was not material. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout fiscal 2002 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately $2 million. The changes of these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2002 compared to currency exchange rates at October 31, 2001 resulted in an increase in net assets of $13.7 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $10.9 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. The trading price of Ropers common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial statements. The stock prices also influence the computation of the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.
