ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In August 2003, we changed our fiscal year end from October 31 to December 31 effective as of January 1, 2003, with the two months ended December 31, 2002 being the Transition Period. We filed an amendment to our Annual Report on Form 10 K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2002 on November 3, 2003 to restate our Consolidated Financial Statements as of October 31, 2001 and 2002 and for the three years ended October 31, 2002 to reflect the discontinued operations of our Petrotech operation and the realignment of our operations into four new segments. Overview We are a diversified industrial company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and industrial imaging products and software, industrial technology products and instrumentation products and services. We market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including water and wastewater, oil and gas, research, power generation, medical, semiconductor, refrigeration, automotive, and general industry. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both financial bolt ons and new strategic platforms. We strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments. On December 29, 2003, we acquired NTGH, comprising Neptune Technology, a leader in the meter management market, DAP Technologies, a leading fully rugged computer provider, and DB Microware, providing various software products for utility markets. As these businesses were closed for the year end holiday period following the acquisition there are no operating results attributable to these operations in our fiscal 2003 results. However, the assets and liabilities of the operations are consolidated in our balance sheet as of December 31, 2003. In connection with this acquisition we retired our existing debt, completed a public offering of 4,200,000 shares of our common stock, entered into a new $625 million credit agreement, and issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes. An underwriters overallotment of 630,000 shares of our common stock was subsequently exercised and closed in January 2004. During the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003, our results of operations benefited from five acquisitions made during the last six months of the fiscal year 2002: 1. Zetec, reported in our Energy Systems and Controls segment 2. AI Qualitek, reported in our Instrumentation segment 3. QImaging, reported in our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment 4. Duncan Technologies, reported in our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment 5. Definitive Imaging, reported in our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment Our largest customer is OAO Gazprom. Gazprom has been a customer over the past eleven years through a number of its procurement affiliates. In late 2002, Gazprom assigned a new procurement affiliate to negotiate with us, and during the second calendar quarter of 2003 we secured a new supply agreement. Orders received under this agreement have been received on a delayed basis and at lower levels than initially indicated by the procurement affiliate and consequently have resulted in lower activity levels than in comparative prior year periods. New orders received under this agreement during the year ended December 31, 2003 totaled $25.2 million or 3.9% of total new orders. Net sales to Gazprom were $22.8 million during the year ended December 31, 2003 as compared to $56.5 million during the year ended October 31, 2002. During the Transition Period ended December 31, 2002, we began reporting our operations under a new segment structure. This structure has realigned our operations into four market focused groups to capture value creating opportunities around common customers, market orientation, sales channels and common cost opportunities. Having recruited and reassigned new managers to lead these realigned groups in the first quarter, we commenced cascading leadership through these segments with the hiring of several key managers from established growth companies to provide enhanced functional and business expertise. Following the segment realignment, we started a number of restructuring activities. We have completed the integration of our Acton Research and Integrated Design business units, the integration of AI Qualitek into the Uson business unit and the integration of production operations of our Redlake business unit into other Imaging segment facilities. In addition, we have opened a new production facility in Mexico as a result of which we closed the U.S. production operations of the Dynamco business unit and commenced the movement of manufacturing of certain other Industrial Technology product lines into this facility. We opened a new production facility in China to better serve customers in that growing market. During the third quarter, we completed our relocation of Struers manufacturing, engineering and administrative support activities into a new facility. Final actions to be completed in the first half of 2004 include the move of the U.S. production operations of the Amot Controls business unit to other facilities and a restructuring of the Compressor Controls business unit to adjust to lower levels of Gazprom business. All of these actions are planned to lower costs and enhance margins. In February 2003, we launched a new motion imaging product line in our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment. Extensive development of this product line commenced during the second quarter of fiscal 2002 and was completed during February 2003. During the development period our customers deferred ordering our existing products in anticipation of significant benefits from our new technology cameras and systems. The weakening of the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2003, particularly against the euro, the Danish krone and the British pound, had a mixed impact on our reported results. Without the currency changes, reported net sales and net orders would have been reduced by $26.2 million and $25.6 million respectively as compared to the prior calendar year. However, the potentially favorable effects on profits from these currency translation efforts were substantially offset by the impact of selling products in the U.S. that we produced in countries with now increased euro denominated costs. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2003 included elsewhere in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long lived assets, recognizing revenues and issuing stock options to employees. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements, except for the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets as discussed below. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory utilization, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percent of completion), income taxes and goodwill analysis. These issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases, credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2003, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, sales returns and sales credits was $4.5 million, or 3% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and has remained constant as a percent of sales as compared to the October 31, 2002 levels and the Transition Period ended December 31, 2002. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. Business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances. At December 31, 2003, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $23.6 million, or 18% of gross first in, first out inventory cost. This percentage has remained constant with both the fiscal year ended October 31, 2002 and the Transition Period ended December 31, 2002. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. At December 31, 2003, the accrual for future warranty obligations was $5.0 million or 0.6% of annualized fourth quarter fiscal 2003 sales. This calculation is based upon both Ropers and NTGHs annualized fourth quarter 2003 sales. The warranty reserve for the NTGH entities is at a similar level to the existing Roper entities. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2003, October 31, 2002 and October 31, 2001. Revenues related to the use of the percentage of completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the twelve month period ended December 31, 2003, we recognized revenue of approximately $31.4 million using this method due primarily to two of our businesses carrying out major energy and water/wastewater projects of a turn key, longer term nature. No material amount of revenue was recognized using this method during the two month period ended December 31, 2002. Approximately $2.4 million and $2.3 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the twelve months ended October 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. At December 31, 2003 approximately $12.6 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage of completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During fiscal 2003, our effective income tax rate was reduced to 27.5% as compared to 30% for the two month period ended December 31, 2002 and 31% for the twelve month period ended October 31, 2002. The primary reasons for the decline for the current fiscal year are the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the NTGH acquisition and related financing and the demonstrated ability to avoid repatriation of certain foreign sourced earnings. We are not expecting to incur in 2004 the one time costs that created this abnormally low tax rate. We adopted SFAS No. 142 effective November 1, 2001 the beginning of our fiscal year ended October 31, 2002. The evaluation of goodwill under SFAS 142 requires valuations of each applicable underlying business. These valuations can be significantly affected by estimates of future performance and discount rates over a relatively long period of time, market price valuation multiples and marketplace transactions in related markets. These estimates will likely change over time. Some of our businesses operate in cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality. The transitional business valuation reviews required by SFAS 142 indicated a reduction of the carrying value of goodwill for three business units (Redlake, Petrotech and Dynamco). This goodwill reduction was reported as a change in accounting principle retroactive to the beginning of our fiscal year ended October 31, 2002 and resulted in a transitional charge to earnings of approximately $26 million. SFAS 142 requires goodwill to be evaluated annually. If this annual review indicates further impairment of goodwill balances, that entire impairment will be recorded immediately and reported as a component of current operations. Our annual reviews undertaken during fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2002 did not indicate that any further impairment to the goodwill balances was necessary. Our acquisitions have generally included a large goodwill component and we expect this to continue with future acquisitions. Prior to adopting SFAS 142, goodwill was amortized over periods not exceeding 40 years. With the adoption of this standard, goodwill is not amortized. It is periodically reviewed for impairment as discussed above. SFAS 142 does not permit retroactive application to years prior to adoption. Therefore, earnings beginning in fiscal 2002 tend to be higher than earlier periods as a result of this accounting change, except for the effects of any impairment provision on current results. Note 5 to our Consolidated Financial Statements includes a reconciliation comparing earnings of pre adoption periods to earnings of current periods for those periods presented. Goodwill amortization prior to the adoption of SFAS 142 was largest in the Instrumentation segment. We are unable to conclude whether the likelihood of any impairment charge resulting from subsequent annual reviews is more likely in any business segment compared to another segment. At December 31, 2003, Ropers total assets included $711.2 million of goodwill. Goodwill was allocated $224.0 million to our Instrumentation segment, $282.8 million to our Industrial Technology segment, $81.5 million to our Energy Systems and Controls segment and $122.9 million to our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment. Total goodwill was allocated to 25 different business units with individual amounts ranging from less than $1 million to approximately $202 million. Results of Operations General The following tables set forth selected information for the years indicated. Dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales. 12 monthsendedDecember 31,2003 2 monthsendedDecember 31,2002 12 monthsendedOctober 31,2002 12 monthsendedOctober 31,2001 Net sales Instrumentation(1) $ 181,329 $ 28,390 $ 175,490 $ 125,354 Industrial Technology 170,324 21,379 164,160 170,822 Energy Systems and Controls(2) 138,968 12,353 126,709 107,043 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 166,735 21,763 151,103 159,736 Total 657,356 83,885 617,462 562,955 Gross profit: Instrumentation 58.3 % 57.7 % 58.6 % 58.4 % Industrial Technology 45.6 43.9 46.2 46.8 Energy Systems and Controls 52.8 38.7 59.8 62.8 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 53.6 50.6 52.3 52.8 Total 52.7 49.5 54.1 54.1 Operating profit: Instrumentation 17.5 % 15.9 % 18.7 % 20.8 % Industrial Technology 21.2 14.4 22.8 24.0 Energy Systems and Controls 19.0 (21.2 ) 26.1 26.4 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 16.8 5.6 17.1 19.1 Total 18.6 7.3 20.9 22.4 Goodwill amortization (2.7 ) Corporate administrative expenses (2.2 ) (1.9 ) (2.2 ) (1.7 ) Restructuring charges(3) (0.1 ) Income from continuing operations 16.4 5.4 18.7 17.9 Interest expense (2.5 ) (3.5 ) (3.0 ) (2.8 ) Euro debt currency exchange loss (0.7 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt (3.8 ) Other income 0.2 0.5 0.7 Income from continuing operations before taxes and change in accounting principle 10.1 2.1 15.6 15.8 Income taxes (2.8 ) (0.6 ) (4.8 ) (5.6 ) Loss on discontinued operations, net of taxes (0.4 ) (0.5 ) (0.1 ) (0.3 ) Goodwill adjustment effective November 1, 2001, net of taxes (4.2 ) Net earnings 6.9 % 1.0 % 6.5 % 9.9 % (1)Includes results of Struers and Logitech from September 2001 and several smaller businesses acquired during the years presented. (2) Includes results of Zetec from August 2002 and several smaller businesses acquired during the years presented. (3) Restructuring charges were $180,000, $279,000 and $50,000 in Industrial Technology, Instrumentation, and Scientific and Industrial Imaging, respectively. Restructuring charges in fiscal 2003 (see Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements) in compliance with SFAS 146, are included as a reduction of operating profits in the respective segments. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended October 31, 2002 Net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 were $657.4 million as compared to sales of $617.5 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2002, an increase of 6.5%. A significant part of the increase was the full year impact of our fiscal 2002 acquisitions, Zetec, AI Qualitek and QImaging. We had a significant decrease in sales to Gazprom ($33.7 million or 59.7% decline from the prior period) as a result of the change in their procurement processes noted previously. This significant decline was offset by sales increases in materials analysis equipment and consumables, imaging sales into electron microscopy markets, water/wastewater projects and other oil and gas sector sales. In our Instrumentation segment, net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 increased by $5.8 million or 3.3% over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was attributable to the full year impact of AI Qualitek (acquired in fiscal 2002) and strong results from our European based Struers operation which was partially offset by continued depressed business conditions in telecommunications markets. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $6.2 million or 3.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was the result of strength in our industrial pumps companies which experienced increased sales in the larger municipal water/wastewater projects. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 increased by $12.3 million or 9.7% over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was due to the full year impact of Zetec acquired in fiscal 2002, offset by the expected lower sales levels to Gazprom. We also had improved sales of our machinery vibration sensor equipment in the current twelve month period. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of $15.6 million or 10.3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was attributable to both the full year impact of QImaging acquired in fiscal 2002 and the increased sales for electron microscopy products. Our overall gross profit percentage was 52.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 as compared to 54.1% for the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. Instrumentation segment gross margins were roughly flat period over period at 58.3% as compared to 58.6%. Industrial Technology gross margins decreased to 45.6% due to an erosion in part of our industrial valves and controls business that is being addressed by moving production to lower cost environments. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment reported margins of 52.8% in fiscal 2003 as compared to 59.8% in fiscal 2002. A decrease was expected this year from the full year inclusion of Zetec whose gross margins are lower than the segment average. Additionally there were lower margins from the significantly lower levels of Gazprom sales in this segment in the current period. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 53.6% in fiscal 2003 as compared to 52.3% in fiscal 2002 as we experienced a rebound in motion imaging equipment sales and a higher percentage of the segment sales in higher margin product. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased to 36.2% of net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 from 35.2% of net sales for the twelve months ended October 31, 2002, primarily from $5.9 million of restructuring expenses (0.9% of net sales) incurred in the current fiscal year to reduce excess manufacturing capacity, move certain operations to lower cost locations and reduce fixed costs. Interest expense decreased $2.1 million, or 11.5%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared to the twelve months ended October 31, 2002, as a result of lower debt levels in the current period. The company used its cash flows generated from operating activities to reduce debt levels prior to the NTGH transaction. Income taxes were 27.5% of pretax earnings in fiscal 2003 compared to 31% in fiscal 2002. The primary factors for the decrease were the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the NTGH acquisition and related financing transactions and the demonstrated ability to avoid repatriation of certain foreign sourced earnings. At December 31, 2003, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at both October 31, 2002 and December 31, 2002. This strengthening resulted in an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $6.8 million in the two month period ending December 31, 2002 and of $36.3 million in the twelve month period ending December 31, 2003. Approximately $33.6 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. Fiscal 2003 operating results also benefited from the stronger non U.S. currencies. The net benefits were approximately 2% of operating earnings. Foreign exchange differences related to our other non U.S. subsidiaries were immaterial to fiscal 2003 financial performance. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2003 and October 31, 2002 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2003 2002 change Instrumentation $ 178,255 $ 168,350 5.9 % Industrial Technology 168,798 161,632 4.4 Energy Systems and Controls 143,933 123,038 17.0 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 154,538 153,349 0.8 Total $ 645,524 $ 606,369 6.5 % Instrumentation segment net orders improved due to the full year bookings of AI Qualitek, continued strength for oil and gas desulfurization applications and higher orders for our materials analysis equipment. Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened over most markets after a soft fiscal 2002. Energy Systems and Controls net orders rose on the strength of a full year of Zetec orders and strength in non Gazprom oil and gas sectors, offset by significantly lower Gazprom orders. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders benefited from the full year of QImaging orders offset by the timing of orders for electron microscopy products (sales increased in the period) and weaker research market demand for high end digital cameras. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2003 and October 31, 2002 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2003 2002 change Instrumentation $ 17,068 $ 17,751 3.8% Industrial Technology 58,024 24,122 140.5 Energy Systems and Controls 30,989 23,985 29.2 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 42,482 40,732 4.3 Total $ 148,563 $ 106,590 39.4 % The increase in backlog was primarily due to the inclusion of the NTGH entities at December 31, 2003. The decline in the Instrumentation segment backlog is the result of continued softness in our telecommunications business. Two Months Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Two Months Ended December 31, 2001 Net sales for the two month period ended December 31, 2002 were $83.9 million as compared to $86.9 million in the two month period ended December 31, 2001. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales to Gazprom and the absence of motion imaging sales in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment, partially offset by the contributions from our fiscal 2002 acquisitions. In our Instrumentation segment, net sales decreased by 7.2% as compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of surplus used equipment flooding the weak telecommunications capital equipment markets for our Logitech unit and lower capital spending in the semi conductor market. Elsewhere softness in oil & gas refinery capital spending offset the benefits of the AI Qualitek acquisition. Gross margins moved from 61.7% in the prior year period to 57.7% in the current period largely from the adverse leverage at our Logitech unit and semi conductor businesses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales were 2.4% higher at 41.8% due to lower sales volume explained above and higher medical insurance expenditures. Overall the segment reported operating profit margins of 15.9% as compared to 22.3% in the prior year period. In our Industrial Technology segment, net sales were comparable to the same period in 2001. Gross margins decreased to 43.9% in the period from 45.0% in the prior year; however, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales were 1.1% lower at 29.5% offsetting the reduction in gross margin allowing the operating profit margin to remain constant at 14.4%. The lower SG&A expense level is primarily the result of headcount reductions. Net sales in our Energy Systems & Controls segment increased by 19.5% during the two months ended December 31, 2002 as sales contributed by Zetec and higher control systems sales to oil and gas customers more than offset the lower sales to Gazprom. Gross margins decreased from 40.7% to 38.7% as a result of the adverse sales leverage from the deferred Gazprom sales and the seasonal low sales at Zetec with reduced power generation inspection activity during the peak heating season. This adverse leverage also resulted in an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales from 48.0% in the prior year period to 59.9% in the current year period. As a result, operating losses increased from 7.3% in the prior year period to 21.2%. Management does not anticipate that the confluence of these events giving rise to such operating margins will recur in the future. Our Scientific & Industrial Imaging segment net sales decreased by 12.0% due primarily to the absence of motion imaging product sales which was partially offset by net sales contributed by the contributions from the QImaging and Definitive Imaging acquisitions. Gross margins decreased from 51.3% in 2002 to 50.6% due to the increased manufacturing costs in the period for TEM imaging equipment. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 45.0% in the period from 35.6% in the prior year period as a result of additional costs associated with the development of the new motion imaging products and additional costs associated with foreign sales subsidiaries. Overall, the segment reported operating profits margins of 5.6% as compared to 15.7% with the bulk of the decline attributable to the repositioning of our motion imaging business. Corporate expenses decreased by $1.0 million and reduced as a percentage of sales from 2.9% to 1.9% due primarily to reduced variable compensation costs. Interest expense held constant at $2.9 million for the two month period ended December 31, 2002 compared to the two month period ended December 31, 2001, as lower effective interest rates offset increased borrowing levels. Other income was $0.2 million in the two month period ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $0.7 million in the equivalent prior year period from reduced realized foreign exchange gains. Income taxes were 30.0% of pretax earnings in the current year period as compared to 35.0% in the equivalent prior year period principally driven by improved expectations for our utilization of all available foreign income tax credits. At December 31, 2002, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at October 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001. This strengthening resulted in a gain of $6.8 million in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings for the two month period ended December 31, 2002. Approximately $5.4 million of the total adjustment related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our expected future cash flows. Operating results in the two month period also benefited from the weakening of the US dollar, primarily against the euro. The difference between the operating results for these companies for the two month period ending December 31, 2002, translated into U.S. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during the two month period and these operating results translated into U.S. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during the comparable two month period in 2001 was not material. If the impact of selling European sourced product in the U.S. is also considered, the impact of currency movements was negligible. Net orders, booked for continuing operations, were $95.3 million for the period, 8% higher than the same period of 2001 net order intake of $88.0 million. This increase was due to the additional net orders booked of $10.6 million from our fiscal 2002 acquisitions, which was somewhat offset by delays in blanket order releases and other industrial market softness for our Industrial Technology segment. Overall, our order backlog at December 31, 2002 increased by $6.6 million as compared to December 31, 2001. This increase was due to new acquisitions having $6.9 million in backlog at December 31, 2002, partially offset by softness in the Industrial Technology segment. Net orders booked for the two months ended December 31, Order backlog as of December 31, 2002 2001 2002 2001 Instrumentation $ 29,433 $ 28,244 $ 18,873 $ 22,286 Industrial Technology 22,811 26,604 25,574 31,183 Energy Systems & Controls 14,254 6,824 25,902 18,426 Scientific & Industrial Imaging 28,780 26,371 46,999 38,874 $ 95,278 $ 88,043 $ 117,348 $ 110,769 Year Ended October 31, 2002 Compared to Year Ended October 31, 2001 Net sales for fiscal 2002 were $617.5 million as compared to sales of $563.0 million in fiscal 2001, an increase of 9.7%. $87.8 million of the sales increase was attributable to acquisitions during fiscal 2002 (Zetec, QImaging, Duncan Technologies, Definitive Imaging and AI Qualitek) and the full year impact of acquisitions made during fiscal 2001 (Struers, Logitech, Media Cybernetics and Dynamco). Excluding this impact net sales declined by 2.7%, to $529.7 million primarily attributable to declines in the semiconductor market and the downturn in oil and gas exploration and certain industrial markets. The impact of these difficult market conditions was somewhat mitigated by a 15% increase in sales to Gazprom and an 8% increase in sales in our fluid properties testing businesses as their products help customers respond to stricter environmental controls regarding sulfur content in petroleum products. In our Instrumentation segment, fiscal 2002 net sales increased by $50.1 million or 40% over fiscal 2001. The increase was primarily attributable to a year on year sales increase of $64.6 million from acquisitions (AI Qualitek acquired in fiscal 2002 and the full year impact of our fiscal 2001 acquisitions Struers and Logitech). Excluding this impact of acquisitions, net sales declined 0.6% (to $110.9 million) as a result of severely depressed business conditions in semiconductor markets. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment declined by $6.7 million or 3.9% from fiscal 2001 to fiscal 2002, primarily from weakness in industrial pump and oil & gas exploration markets. The full year impact of the fiscal 2001 acquisition of Dynamco slightly mitigated this decrease. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales increased by $19.7 million or 18.4% with $13.1 million of the increase being attributable to the fiscal 2002 acquisition of Zetec. Excluding the impact of Zetec, net sales increased 6.1% (to $113.6 million) due to gains in sales of oil & gas control system applications, including those sold to Gazprom. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported a decrease in net sales in fiscal 2002 as compared to fiscal 2001 of $8.6 million or 5.4%. The decrease resulted principally from lower motion product sales due to the pending release of a new generation of products that began shipping during the first quarter of fiscal 2003. Fiscal 2002 acquisitions (QImaging, Definitive Imaging and Duncan Technologies) and the full year increase of a fiscal 2001 acquisition (Media Cybernetics) mitigated the decline by $8.8 million. Excluding the impact of these acquisitions net sales declined by 11.1% (to $139.2 million). Our overall gross profit percentage was 54.1% in fiscal 2002 and the same as in fiscal 2001. Instrumentation segment gross margins were roughly flat in fiscal 2002 at 58.6% as compared to 58.4% in fiscal 2001. Industrial Technology gross margins decreased to 46.2% in fiscal 2002 as compared to 46.8% in fiscal 2001 as a result of adverse volume leverage in our industrial pumps businesses. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment reported margins of 59.8% in fiscal 2002 as compared to 62.8% in fiscal 2001, attributable to lower gross margins at Zetec as compared to the segment average. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segments gross margins were 52.3% in fiscal 2002 as compared to 52.8% in fiscal 2001 as margins declined for motion imaging equipment with the significant reduction in sales. Excluding the effects from the accounting changes related to goodwill and the related amortization charges expensed in fiscal 2001 of $15.3 million, selling, general & administrative (SG&A) expenses increased to 35.2% of net sales in fiscal 2002 from 33.5% of net sales in fiscal 2001. This increase is attributable to higher SG&A expense levels at newly acquired businesses. SG&A expenses for companies included in all of both 2002 and 2001 declined 2% in 2002 despite significantly increased R&D and other engineering expenses in our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment, most notably Redlake MASD. There was also an increase in corporate SG&A due primarily to an increase in medical insurance costs and salaries and related employee relocation costs. As a percentage of net sales, SG&A expenses also increased in 2002 compared to 2001 for each of our four business segments by between 1% and 2%. Interest expense increased $2.6 million, or 16%, for the year ended October 31, 2002 compared to the year ended October 31, 2001. Average borrowing levels were approximately 36% higher during fiscal 2002 compared to the prior year due to acquisitions and effective interest rates were approximately 14% lower during fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001. A euro debt foreign exchange loss of $4.1 million arose from euro denominated debt that was carried in the U.S. and the strengthening of the euro against the U.S. dollar during the third quarter of fiscal 2002. This debt matured near July 31, 2002 and was replaced with U.S. dollar denominated debt. Income taxes were 31% of pretax earnings in fiscal 2002 compared to 35% in fiscal 2001. Two of the key factors related to the reduced rate were the change in accounting for goodwill amortization and our expected utilization of all available foreign income tax credits associated with European tax structures. During fiscal 2002, we completed a transition review for goodwill impairment under SFAS 142 as of November 1, 2001. This review initially compared the fair value of each previously acquired reporting unit to its carrying value. If an impairment was indicated, the amount was then determined by comparing the implied fair value of goodwill to its carrying amount. This impairment was reported as a change in accounting principle, was a non cash charge and was related to the Redlake, Petrotech and Dynamco units. At October 31, 2002, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at October 31, 2001. This strengthening resulted in a gain of $13.7 million in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings for fiscal 2002. Approximately $11 million of this adjustment related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our expected future cash flows. Fiscal 2002s operating results also benefited slightly from the stronger non U.S. currencies. The benefits were less than 2% of operating earnings. Foreign exchange differences related to our other non U.S. subsidiaries were immaterial to fiscal 2002s financial information. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended October 31 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2002 2001 change Instrumentation $ 168,350 $ 118,481 42 % Industrial Technology 161,632 171,550 6 Energy Systems and Controls 123,038 119,137 3 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 153,349 157,096 2 Total $ 606,369 $ 566,264 7 % Instrumentation segment net orders improved due largely to 2001 and 2002 acquisitions and higher orders for oil and gas desulfurization applications, offset somewhat by lower orders for semiconductor capital equipment markets. Industrial Technology segment net orders declined on weak industrial and oil and gas exploration markets. Energy Systems and Controls net orders rose because of higher demand for the Companys turbomachinery control systems, as well as the 2002 acquisition of Zetec, with the year to year comparison adversely affected by a $20 million supplemental order from Gazprom in 2001. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders fell as the benefit from 2002 and 2001 acquisitions was more than offset by weak semiconductor markets and lower motion imaging product activity. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at October 31 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2002 2001 change Instrumentation $ 17,751 $ 25,155 29 % Industrial Technology 24,122 26,608 9 Energy Systems and Controls 23,985 21,928 9 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 40,732 38,100 7 Total $ 106,590 $ 111,791 5% A significant impact on the decreased sales order backlog at October 31, 2002 compared to October 31, 2001 was the $11.5 million residual one time supplemental Gazprom order which is included in the prior year backlog for Energy Systems and Controls. Excluding this order, total Company backlog increased 6% from $100.3 million to $106.6 million. Declines in Instrumentation and Industrial Technology were attributable to weak semiconductor and oil exploration markets, respectively. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $71.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, $86.8 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2002 and $102.4 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2001. Excluding the one time write off of debt extinguishment costs related to the recapitalization of the Company of $24.4 million, net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2003 was $95.7 million, an increase of $8.9 million over fiscal 2002. This increase reflected stronger earnings from operations and reduced inventories. Most of the decrease in fiscal 2002 compared to fiscal 2001 was attributed to the one time supplemental order for Gazprom, partially offset by improved cash generation from assets. We expect our net cash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2004 to be higher than the levels experienced in the prior three fiscal years due to the NTGH acquisition completed on December 29, 2003. Cash flows used in investing activities during each of fiscal 2003, 2002, and 2001 were primarily business acquisition costs. Cash flows from financing activities during each of these years were largely the borrowing activities associated with the business acquisitions and the debt reductions from our other net positive cash flows. Financing activities in fiscal 2003 also included replacing our existing $275 million credit agreement and $125 million senior notes with our current $625 million credit agreement and $230 million senior subordinated convertible notes. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $170.4 million at December 31, 2003 compared to $126.7 million at October 31, 2002. We acquired approximately $70.2 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during fiscal 2003. Total debt was $651.1 million at December 31, 2003 (49.8% of total capital) compared to $332.1 million at October 31, 2002 (47% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2003 compared to October 31, 2002 was due to borrowings incurred at the end of the current fiscal year to fund the NTGH acquisition and replace the previous credit agreement and senior notes. Our principal $625 million credit facility with a group of banks and our $230 million senior subordinated convertible notes will provide most of our daily external financing requirements. The credit facility consists of a $400 million term loan with a five year maturity and a $225 million revolving loan with a three year maturity. Our senior subordinated convertible notes are due in 2034. At December 31, 2003, our debt consisted of the $230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes, a $400 million term loan and $20 million drawn against the revolver. The Company also had $14.5 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2003. We expect that our available additional borrowing capacity combined with the cash flows expected to be generated from existing business will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance some additional acquisitions. Additionally, on January 6, 2004 we received approximately $30 million from the exercise of the underwriters overallotment in connection with our public offering of common shares. We also have several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non U.S. businesses. In total, these smaller facilities do not represent a significant source of credit for us. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2003. Capital expenditures of $10.4 million, $7.7 million and $7.4 million were incurred during fiscal 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. We expect capital expenditures in fiscal 2004 to be slightly higher as a percentage of sales due to the current higher capital expenditure requirements of the newly acquired Neptune Technology business. In November 2003, Ropers Board of Directors increased the quarterly cash dividend paid on our outstanding common stock to $0.09625 per share from $0.0875 per share, an increase of 10%. This represents the eleventh consecutive year in which the quarterly dividend has been increased since Ropers 1992 initial public offering. Our board of directors has declared a dividend payable on January 31, 2004. Payment of any additional dividends requires further action by the board of directors. Description of Certain Indebtedness New Senior Secured Credit Facility Concurrently with the closing of the NTGH acquisition and the common stock and debt offerings in December 2003, we entered into a new $625 million senior secured credit facility. The new credit facility consists of a five year $400 million term loan and a three year $225 million revolving loan. Our new credit facility requires us to prepay our term loan and, in certain cases, reduce our commitments under our revolving loan, upon the receipt of certain proceeds, including from certain asset sales, the incurrence of certain debt, and up to 75% of our excess cash flows, unless we meet a consolidated senior leverage ratio test. We are also required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loans. The facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and consolidated senior leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes In December 2003, we also issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%, resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After that date, we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable. Instead, after January 15, 2009, interest will be recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and will represent accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. Each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 6.211 shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we will have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2009, January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes for cash at any time on or after January 15, 2009 at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the applicable redemption date. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following table quantifies our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2003 (dollars in thousands). Contractual Cash Obligations Payments Due in Fiscal Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Long term debt $ 651,109 $ 21,109 $ 20,000 $ 60,000 $ 40,000 $ 280,000 $ 230,000 Operating Leases 62,300 11,800 9,700 7,100 5,300 4,500 23,900 Total $ 713,409 $ 32,909 $ 29,700 $ 67,100 $ 45,300 $ 284,500 $ 253,900 Other Commercial Commitments Amounts Expiring in Fiscal Total Amount Committed 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Standby letters of credit and bank guarantees $ 14,546 $ 5,316 $ 9,200 $30 At December 31, 2003 and October 31, 2002, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our recently acquired companies as well as our other companies will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a high rate. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during fiscal 2004 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies; and none of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards The Company adopted Statement of Accounting Financial Standard, SFAS No. 143 Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations as of November 1, 2002. There was no material impact to the company related to this new statement. The Company adopted FASB Interpretation No. 45 Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others as of January 1, 2003. This Interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The Company has no new guarantees after December 31, 2002 requiring the measurement provisions of this Interpretation. In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46(FIN 46), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. An entity is subject to the consolidation rules of FIN 46 and is referred to as a variable interest entity (VIE) if the entitys equity investors lack the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its operations without additional financial support. FIN 46 applies immediately to all VIEs created after January 31, 2003 and is effective as of December 31, 2003 for any VIEs deemed to be special purpose entities (SPEs) created prior to February 1, 2003. The FASB issued a revision to FIN 46 (FIN 46 R) in December 2003. FIN 46 R is effective for the interim period ending March 31, 2004 for all new or existing VIEs. The Company is not required to adopt FIN 46 since it has no SPEs. The Company will implement the provisions of FIN 46 R in the first quarter of fiscal year 2004, and is evaluating the effect this Interpretation will have on the Companys financial statements. The FASB issued SFAS No. 148 Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123 which provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends certain disclosure requirements of Statement 123. Currently, Roper has chosen not to adopt the accounting provisions of SFAS 123; however, as permitted by SFAS 123, the Company continues to apply intrinsic value accounting for its stock option plans under Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 (APB 25), Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, which amends and clarifies the accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under SFAS No. 133. SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, with some exceptions for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The adoption of SFAS 149 on July 1, 2003 had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of both Liabilities and Equity, which modifies the accounting for certain financial instruments. SFAS No. 150 requires that these financial instruments be classified as liabilities and applied immediately for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after June 15, 2003. The adoption of SFAS No. 150 on July 1, 2003 had no impact on the consolidated financial statements. In December 2003, the FASB revised SFAS No. 132, Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits. The new SFAS No. 132 requires additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans, of which certain disclosures are not required until 2004. The Company has adopted the disclosure requirements that were effective for 2003. In January 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106 1 (FSP 106 1) Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which provides temporary guidance concerning the recently enacted Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the Act). SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires presently enacted changes in laws that will take effect in future periods to be taken into account in measuring current period postretirement benefit cost and the accumulated projected benefit obligation (APBO). FSP 106 1 allows companies that sponsor affected postretirement benefit plans to elect to defer recognizing the effects of the Act on postretirement benefit expense and on the APBO pursuant to SFAS No. 106. The Company has elected to defer accounting for the effects of the Act until 2004. In November 2002, the EITF issued a final consensus on EITF Issue No. 00 21, Accounting for Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, which addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products, services, and or rights to use assets. EITF Issue No. 00 21 is effective prospectively for arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after June 15, 2003. Companies may also elect to apply the provisions of EITF Issue No. 00 21 to existing arrangements and record the income statement impact as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. The Company has adopted EITF Issue No. 00 21 prospectively for contracts beginning after June 30, 2003. In December 2003, the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition, which clarifies existing SEC guidance regarding revenues for contracts that contain multiple deliverables to make it consistent with EITF Issue No. 00 21. The adoption of SAB 104 did not have a material effect on the Companys financial position, operations, or cash flows. Information About Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report includes and incorporates by reference forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In addition, we, or our executive officers on our behalf, may from time to time make forward looking statements in reports and other documents we file with the SEC or in connection with oral statements made to the press, potential investors or others. All statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements. The words estimate, project, intend, expect, believe, anticipate, and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our expected financial position, business, financing plans, business strategy, business prospects, revenues, working capital, liquidity, capital needs, interest costs and income, in each case relating to our company as a whole, as well as statements regarding acquisitions, potential acquisitions and the benefits of acquisitions, including with respect to the NTGH acquisition. Forward looking statements are estimates and projections reflecting our best judgment and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements. These statements are based on our managements beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. Examples of forward looking statements in this report include but are not limited to our expectations regarding our ability to generate operating cash flows and reduce debt and associated interest expense and our expectations regarding growth through acquisitions. Important assumptions relating to the forward looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding demand for our products, the cost, timing and success of product upgrades and new product introductions, raw materials costs, expected pricing levels, the timing and cost of expected capital expenditures, expected outcomes of pending litigation, competitive conditions, general economic conditions and expected synergies relating to acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. Although we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable, our expectations may prove to be incorrect. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in the forward looking statements include: our ability to integrate the NTGH acquisition businesses into our operations; any unforeseen liabilities associated with the NTGH businesses or future acquisitions; limitations on our business imposed by our indebtedness; reductions in our business with Gazprom; the success of our restructuring activities in reducing costs; unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates; difficulties associated with exports; risks and costs associated with our international sales and operations; difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses; increased product liability and insurance costs; increased directors and officers liability and other insurance costs; product liability and insurance risks; increased warranty exposure; future competition; the cyclical nature of our markets; changes in the supply of, or price for, parts and components; environmental compliance costs and liabilities; risks and costs associated with asbestos related litigation; potential write offs of our substantial intangible assets; our ability to successfully develop new products; failure to protect our technology; trade tariffs that may be applied due to the U.S. governments delay in complying with certain WTO directives; terrorist attacks; future health crises; and the factors discussed in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report under the heading Risk Factors. We believe these forward looking statements are reasonable. However, you should not place undue reliance on any forward looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Further, forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2003 we had a combination of fixed rate borrowings (primarily our $230 million senior subordinated convertible notes) and relatively variable rate borrowings under the $625 million credit facility. Our $400 million 5 year term note under this credit facility was variable at a spread over LIBOR. Any borrowings under the $225 million revolver have a fixed rate, but the terms of these individual borrowings are generally only 1 3 months. Subsequent to year end, we fixed the interest rate at 4.108% on $100 million of the term note for a period of two years. At December 31, 2003, there was no material difference between prevailing market rates and the fixed rate on our debt instruments. At December 31, 2003, Ropers outstanding variable rate borrowings under the $625 million credit facility were $420 million. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $3.2 million. Several Roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, British pounds, Danish krone or Japanese yen. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 27% of our total sales and 77% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar weakened against these European currencies during fiscal 2003 and was relatively stable compared to other currencies. The difference between fiscal 2003s operating results for these companies translated into U.S. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal 2003 and these operating results translated into U.S. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during fiscal 2002 was not material. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout fiscal 2003 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately $1.4 million. The changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during fiscal 2003 compared to currency exchange rates at October 31, 2002 resulted in an increase in net assets of $43.0 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $33.6 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. The trading price of Ropers common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial statements. The stock prices also influence the computation of the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.
