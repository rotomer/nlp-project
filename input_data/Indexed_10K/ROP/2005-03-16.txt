ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. In August 2003, we changed our fiscal year end from October 31 to December 31 effective as of January 1, 2003, with the two months ended December 31, 2002 being the Transition Period. Overview We are a diversified industrial company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and industrial imaging products and software, industrial technology products, instrumentation products and services and radio frequency identification and satellite based communication technologies and related services. We market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including radio frequency (RF) applications, water and wastewater, oil and gas, research, power generation, general industry and 15 other niche markets. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both bolt ons and new strategic platforms. We strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments. On June 7, 2004, we purchased the power generation business of R/D Tech which was combined with our existing Zetec business in the area of non destructive evaluation. On December 13, 2004, we acquired TransCore a provider of technologies and related services in areas such as radio frequency identification (RFID), satellite based communication, mobile asset tracking, security applications and comprehensive toll system and processing services. In connection with this acquisition we replaced our existing $625 million credit agreement, completed a public offering of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock, and entered into an amended and restated $1.055 billion credit agreement. An underwriters overallotment of 115,000 shares of our common stock was subsequently exercised and closed on December 28, 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2004, our results of operations benefited from the NTGH acquisition made on December 29, 2003 and the partial year activities of the power generation business of R/D Tech purchased on June 7, 2004. During the Transition Period ended December 31, 2002, we began reporting our operations under a new segment structure. This structure includes four market focused groups intended to capture value creating opportunities around common customers, market orientation, sales channels, technologies and common cost opportunities. Following the segment realignment, we started a number of restructuring activities that were completed in the first quarter of 2004. During 2003, we completed the integration of our Acton Research and Integrated Design business units, the integration of AI Qualitek into the Uson business unit, the integration of production operations of our Redlake business unit into other Imaging segment facilities and the relocation of Struers manufacturing, engineering and administrative support into a new facility. In 2003 we also opened new production facilities in Mexico and China. During 2004 we moved the U.S. production operations of the Amot Controls business unit to other facilities and completed a restructuring of the Compressor Controls business unit to adjust to lower levels of OAO Gazprom business. All of these actions were planned to lower costs and enhance profit margins. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2004 included elsewhere in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long lived assets, recognizing revenues and issuing stock options to employees. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements, except for the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets as discussed below. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory utilization, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percent of completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite lived asset analyses. These issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2004, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable, sales returns and sales credits was $7.8 million, or 3.1% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables and is not significantly different as a percent of sales as compared to the December 31, 2003 level. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. Business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances. At December 31, 2004, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $25.6 million, or 16.1% of gross first in, first out inventory cost. This percentage has decreased from 18.0% in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003. We expect this percentage to continue to decrease over time. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. At December 31, 2004, the reserve for future warranty obligations was $6.4 million. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2004, December 31, 2003, and October 31, 2002. Revenues related to the use of the percentage of completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the twelve month period ended December 31, 2004, we recognized revenue of approximately $16.8 million using this method, primarily for major turn key, longer term energy projects. No material amount of revenue was recognized using this method during the two month period ended December 31, 2002. Approximately $31.4 million and $2.4 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 and October 31, 2002, respectively. At December 31, 2004 approximately $58.3 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage of completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. We expect a significant increase in revenue related to the use of percentage of completion accounting in 2005 as TransCore has several longer term projects related to toll and traffic systems that require use of this method. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2004, our effective income tax rate was 29.8%, which included a $0.9 million additional R&D credit, as compared to 27.5% for 2003. Our 2003 rate was abnormally low due to the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the NTGH acquisition and related financing and the demonstrated ability to avoid repatriation of certain foreign sourced earnings. We expect our tax rate in 2005 to increase to approximately 32.5% due primarily to TransCores higher effective rate. We adopted SFAS No. 142 effective November 1, 2001 the beginning of our fiscal year ended October 31, 2002. The evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets under SFAS 142 requires valuations of each applicable underlying business. These valuations can be significantly affected by estimates of future performance and discount rates over a relatively long period of time, market price valuation multiples and marketplace transactions in related markets. These estimates will likely change over time. Some of our businesses operate in somewhat cyclical industries and the valuation of these businesses can be expected to fluctuate as a result of this cyclicality. The transitional business valuation reviews required by SFAS 142 indicated a reduction of the carrying value of goodwill for three business units (Redlake, Petrotech and Dynamco). This goodwill reduction was reported as a change in accounting principle retroactive to the beginning of our fiscal year ended October 31, 2002 and resulted in a transitional charge to earnings of approximately $26 million. SFAS 142 requires goodwill to be evaluated annually. If this annual review indicates further impairment of goodwill balances, that entire impairment will be recorded immediately and reported as a component of current operations. Our annual reviews undertaken during 2004 and 2003 did not indicate that any further impairment to the goodwill balances was necessary. Our acquisitions have generally included a large goodwill component and we expect this to continue with future acquisitions. Prior to adopting SFAS 142, goodwill was amortized over periods not exceeding 40 years. With the adoption of this standard, goodwill is not amortized. It is periodically reviewed for impairment as discussed above. We are unable to conclude whether the likelihood of any impairment charge resulting from subsequent annual reviews is more likely in any business segment compared to another segment. Results of Operations General The following tables set forth selected information for the years indicated. Dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales. 12 monthsendedDecember 31,2004 12 monthsendedDecember 31,2003 2 monthsendedDecember 31,2002 12 monthsendedOctober 31,2002 Net sales Instrumentation $ 213,722 $ 181,329 $ 28,390 $ 175,490 Industrial Technology(1) 396,671 170,324 21,379 164,160 Energy Systems and Controls(2) 156,232 138,968 12,353 126,709 Scientific and Industrial Imaging(3) 187,926 166,735 21,763 151,103 RF Technology(4) 15,213 Total 969,764 657,356 83,885 617,462 Gross profit: Instrumentation 57.8 % 58.3 % 57.7 % 58.6 % Industrial Technology 42.6 45.6 43.9 46.2 Energy Systems and Controls 52.3 52.8 38.7 59.8 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 55.7 53.6 50.6 52.3 RF Technology 40.4 Total 50.0 52.7 49.5 54.1 Operating profit: Instrumentation 20.2 % 17.5 % 15.9 % 18.7 % Industrial Technology 20.7 21.2 14.4 22.8 Energy Systems and Controls 21.6 19.0 (21.2 ) 26.1 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 17.2 16.8 5.6 17.1 RF Technology (0.1 ) Total 19.7 18.6 7.3 20.9 Corporate administrative expenses (2.0 ) (2.2 ) (1.9 ) (2.2 ) Income from continuing operations 17.7 16.4 5.4 18.7 Interest expense (3.0 ) (2.5 ) (3.5 ) (3.0 ) Euro debt currency exchange loss (0.7 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt (0.8 ) (3.8 ) Other income/(expense) (0.1 ) 0.2 0.5 Income from continuing operations before taxes and change in accounting principle 13.8 10.1 2.1 15.6 Income taxes (4.1 ) (2.8 ) (0.6 ) (4.8 ) Loss on discontinued operations, net of taxes (0.4 ) (0.5 ) (0.1 ) Goodwill adjustment effective November 1, 2001, net of taxes (4.2 ) Net earnings 9.7 % 6.9 % 1.0 % 6.5 % (1) Includes results of NTGH acquisition from December 29, 2003. (2) Includes results of Zetec from August 2002, and the power generation business of R/D Tech from June 7, 2004. (3) Includes results of NTGH acquisition from December 29, 2003 and several smaller business acquired during the years presented. (4) Includes results of TransCore from December 13, 2004. Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $969.8 million as compared to sales of $657.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of 47.5%. This increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth. Our 2004 results included a full year of sales from the NTGH acquisition, six months of sales from the power generation business of R/D Tech and two weeks of sales from the TransCore acquisition. In our Instrumentation segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased by $32.4 million or 17.9% over the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was attributable to improved distribution, new product introductions, favorable market conditions, and changes in exchange rates. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $226.3 million or 132.9% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The increase primarily resulted from the NTGH acquisition, and also included stronger sales into industrial, energy, and commercial refrigeration end markets. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 increased by $17.3 million or 12.4% over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The increase was due to the partial year impact of the power generation business of R/D Tech acquired in 2004 as well as higher system and product sales of energy applications, substantially offset by lower sales to Gazprom. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of $21.2 million or 12.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The increase was attributable to the full year impact of NTGH acquired in 2003. Our RF Technology segment was established in the fourth quarter of 2004 with the acquisition of TransCore on December 13, 2004 and includes two weeks of sales in 2004. Our overall gross profit percentage was 50.0% for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to 52.7% for the year ended December 31, 2003. Instrumentation segment gross margins decreased to 57.8% as compared to 58.3% in the prior year. The margins were impacted by increased sales of third party sourced products that carried a lower gross profit margin, but good operating profit margins. As expected, Industrial Technology gross margins decreased, to 42.6% as compared to 45.6% in the prior year, because NTGH gross margins are lower than the segment average. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment gross margins were 52.3% in 2004 as compared to 52.8% in 2003. This was due to a margin decrease in our turbomachinery controls business offset by an increase in margins in our non destructive testing business. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 55.7% in 2004 as compared to 53.6% in 2003. This increase is due to improved margins in our high performance digital imaging cameras and electron microscopes, much of which was achieved through the restructuring efforts undertaken in 2003. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased to 32.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 36.2% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease is due to leverage from higher sales levels and the reductions in restructuring expenses that were incurred in the prior year. This was offset with increased expenses related to compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act. Interest expense increased $12.5 million, or 76.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, as a result of higher debt levels incurred due to the NTGH acquisition in December 2003. Income taxes were 29.8% of pretax earnings in 2004 compared to 27.5% for 2003. Our 2003 rate was low due to the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the NTGH acquisition and related financing. Our 2004 rate also included an additional $0.9 million credit related to a R&D study completed during the year. We expect our tax rate in 2005 to increase to approximately 32.5% due primarily to TransCores higher effective rate. At December 31, 2004, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2003. This strengthening resulted in an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $27.3 million in the twelve month period ending December 31, 2004. Approximately $19.5 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. 2004 operating earnings benefited 1.9% from stronger non U.S. currencies. Foreign exchange differences related to our other non U.S. subsidiaries were immaterial to 2004 financial performance. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2004 2003 change Instrumentation $ 215,821 $ 178,255 21.1 % Industrial Technology 386,488 168,798 129.0 Energy Systems and Controls 170,459 143,933 18.4 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 182,887 154,538 18.3 RF Technology 15,213 n.m. Total $ 970,868 $ 645,524 50.4 % Instrumentation segment net orders improved due to continued strength for oil and gas desulfurization applications and higher orders for our materials analysis equipment. In addition, approximately 5.1% of the increase was due to the stronger European and Asian currencies against the dollar. Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened over all markets from the prior year and also benefited from the orders for Neptune which were not included in the prior year. Energy Systems and Controls net orders rose due to strength in the non destructive testing markets as well as the inclusion of the orders of the power generation business of R/D Tech which is included for almost seven months of the current year. In addition, there was continued strength in non Gazprom oil and gas sectors, offset by significantly lower Gazprom orders. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders increased from strong orders for electron microscopy products. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollar amounts in thousands). Ropers policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2004 2003 change Instrumentation $ 20,310 $ 17,068 19.0 % Industrial Technology 50,004 58,024 13.8 Energy Systems and Controls 45,076 30,989 45.5 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 36,835 42,482 13.3 RF Technology 183,742 Total $ 335,967 $ 148,563 126.1 % The increase in backlog is due primarily to the inclusion of the TransCore backlog of firm orders which can be shipped within twelve months. Year Ended December 31, 2003 Compared to Year Ended October 31, 2002 Net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 were $657.4 million as compared to sales of $617.5 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2002, an increase of 6.5%. A significant part of the increase was the full year impact of our fiscal 2002 acquisitions, Zetec, AI Qualitek and QImaging. We had a significant decrease in sales to Gazprom ($33.7 million or 59.7% decline from the prior period) as a result of the change in their procurement processes. This significant decline was offset by sales increases in materials analysis equipment and consumables, imaging sales into electron microscopy markets, water/wastewater projects and other oil and gas sector sales. In our Instrumentation segment, net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 increased by $5.8 million or 3.3% over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was attributable to the full year impact of AI Qualitek (acquired in fiscal 2002) and strong results from our European based Struers operation which was partially offset by continued depressed business conditions in telecommunications markets. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $6.2 million or 3.8% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was the result of strength in our industrial pumps companies which experienced increased sales in the larger municipal water/wastewater projects. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 increased by $12.3 million or 9.7% over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was due to the full year impact of Zetec acquired in fiscal 2002, offset by the expected lower sales levels to Gazprom. We also had improved sales of our machinery vibration sensor equipment in the current twelve month period. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of $15.6 million or 10.3% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 over the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. The increase was attributable to both the full year impact of QImaging acquired in fiscal 2002 and the increased sales for electron microscopy products. Our overall gross profit percentage was 52.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 as compared to 54.1% for the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. Instrumentation segment gross margins were roughly flat period over period at 58.3% as compared to 58.6%. Industrial Technology gross margins decreased to 45.6% due to an erosion in part of our industrial valves and controls business that was addressed by moving production to lower cost environments. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment reported margins of 52.8% in fiscal 2003 as compared to 59.8% in fiscal 2002. A decrease was expected this year from the full year inclusion of Zetec whose gross margins are lower than the segment average. Additionally there were lower margins from the significantly lower levels of Gazprom sales in this segment in the current period. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 53.6% in fiscal 2003 as compared to 52.3% in fiscal 2002 as we experienced a rebound in motion imaging equipment sales and a higher percentage of the segment sales in higher margin product. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased to 36.2% of net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 from 35.2% of net sales for the twelve months ended October 31, 2002, primarily from $5.9 million of restructuring expenses (0.9% of net sales) incurred in the current fiscal year to reduce excess manufacturing capacity, move certain operations to lower cost locations and reduce fixed costs. Interest expense decreased $2.1 million, or 11.5%, for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003 compared to the twelve months ended October 31, 2002, as a result of lower debt levels in the current period. The company used its cash flows generated from operating activities to reduce debt levels prior to the NTGH transaction. Income taxes were 27.5% of pretax earnings in fiscal 2003 compared to 31% in fiscal 2002. The primary factors for the decrease were the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the NTGH acquisition and related financing transactions and the demonstrated ability to avoid repatriation of certain foreign sourced earnings. At December 31, 2003, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at both October 31, 2002 and December 31, 2002. This strengthening resulted in an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $6.8 million in the two month period ending December 31, 2002 and of $36.3 million in the twelve month period ending December 31, 2003. Approximately $33.6 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. Fiscal 2003 operating results also benefited from the stronger non U.S. currencies. The net benefits were approximately 2% of operating earnings. Foreign exchange differences related to our other non U.S. subsidiaries were immaterial to fiscal 2003 financial performance. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2003 and October 31, 2002 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2003 2002 change Instrumentation $ 178,255 $ 168,350 5.9 % Industrial Technology 168,798 161,632 4.4 Energy Systems and Controls 143,933 123,038 17.0 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 154,538 153,349 0.8 Total $ 645,524 $ 606,369 6.5 % Instrumentation segment net orders improved due to the full year bookings of AI Qualitek, continued strength for oil and gas desulfurization applications and higher orders for our materials analysis equipment. Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened over most markets after a soft fiscal 2002. Energy Systems and Controls net orders rose on the strength of a full year of Zetec orders and strength in non Gazprom oil and gas sectors, offset by significantly lower Gazprom orders. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders benefited from the full year of QImaging orders offset by the timing of orders for electron microscopy products (sales increased in the period) and weaker research market demand for high end digital cameras. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2003 and October 31, 2002 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2003 2002 change Instrumentation $ 17,068 $ 17,751 3.8% Industrial Technology 58,024 24,122 140.5 Energy Systems and Controls 30,989 23,985 29.2 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 42,482 40,732 4.3 Total $ 148,563 $ 106,590 39.4 % The increase in backlog was primarily due to the inclusion of the NTGH entities at December 31, 2003. The decline in the Instrumentation backlog is the result of continued softness in our telecommunications business. Two Months Ended December 31, 2002 Compared to Two Months Ended December 31, 2001 Net sales for the two month period ended December 31, 2002 were $83.9 million as compared to $86.9 million in the two month period ended December 31, 2001. This decrease was primarily attributable to lower sales to Gazprom and the absence of motion imaging sales in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment, partially offset by the contributions from our fiscal 2002 acquisitions. In our Instrumentation segment, net sales decreased by 7.2% as compared to the prior year period primarily as a result of surplus used equipment flooding the weak telecommunications capital equipment markets for our Logitech unit and lower capital spending in the semi conductor market. Elsewhere softness in oil & gas refinery capital spending offset the benefits of the AI Qualitek acquisition. Gross margins moved from 61.7% in the prior year period to 57.7% in the current period largely from the adverse leverage at our Logitech unit and semi conductor businesses. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales were 2.4% higher at 41.8% due to lower sales volume explained above and higher medical insurance expenditures. Overall the segment reported operating profit margins of 15.9% as compared to 22.3% in the prior year period. In our Industrial Technology segment, net sales were comparable to the same period in 2001. Gross margins decreased to 43.9% in the period from 45.0% in the prior year; however, SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales were 1.1% lower at 29.5% offsetting the reduction in gross margin allowing the operating profit margin to remain constant at 14.4%. The lower SG&A expense level is primarily the result of headcount reductions. Net sales in our Energy Systems & Controls segment increased by 19.5% during the two months ended December 31, 2002 as sales contributed by Zetec and higher control systems sales to oil and gas customers more than offset the lower sales to Gazprom. Gross margins decreased from 40.7% to 38.7% as a result of the adverse sales leverage from the deferred Gazprom sales and the seasonal low sales at Zetec with reduced power generation inspection activity during the peak heating season. This adverse leverage also resulted in an increase in SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales from 48.0% in the prior year period to 59.9% in the current year period. As a result, operating losses increased from 7.3% in the prior year period to 21.2%. Management does not anticipate that the confluence of these events giving rise to such operating margins will recur in the future. Our Scientific & Industrial Imaging segment net sales decreased by 12.0% due primarily to the absence of motion imaging product sales which was partially offset by net sales contributed by the contributions from the QImaging and Definitive Imaging acquisitions. Gross margins decreased from 51.3% in 2002 to 50.6% due to the increased manufacturing costs in the period for TEM imaging equipment. SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales increased to 45.0% in the period from 35.6% in the prior year period as a result of additional costs associated with the development of the new motion imaging products and additional costs associated with foreign sales subsidiaries. Overall, the segment reported operating profits margins of 5.6% as compared to 15.7% with the bulk of the decline attributable to the repositioning of our motion imaging business. Corporate expenses decreased by $1.0 million and reduced as a percentage of sales from 2.9% to 1.9% due primarily to reduced variable compensation costs. Interest expense held constant at $2.9 million for the two month period ended December 31, 2002 compared to the two month period ended December 31, 2001, as lower effective interest rates offset increased borrowing levels. Other income was $0.2 million in the two month period ended December 31, 2002 as compared to $0.7 million in the equivalent prior year period from reduced realized foreign exchange gains. Income taxes were 30.0% of pretax earnings in the current year period as compared to 35.0% in the equivalent prior year period principally driven by improved expectations for our utilization of all available foreign income tax credits. At December 31, 2002, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at October 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001. This strengthening resulted in a gain of $6.8 million in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings for the two month period ended December 31, 2002. Approximately $5.4 million of the total adjustment related to goodwill and is not expected to directly affect our expected future cash flows. Operating results in the two month period also benefited from the weakening of the US dollar, primarily against the euro. The difference between the operating results for these companies for the two month period ending December 31, 2002, translated into U.S. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during the two month period and these operating results translated into U.S. dollars at average currency exchange rates experienced during the comparable two month period in 2001 was not material. If the impact of selling European sourced product in the U.S. is also considered, the impact of currency movements was negligible. Net orders, booked for continuing operations, were $95.3 million for the period, 8% higher than the same period of 2001 net order intake of $88.0 million. This increase was due to the additional net orders booked of $10.6 million from our fiscal 2002 acquisitions, which was somewhat offset by delays in blanket order releases and other industrial market softness for our Industrial Technology segment. Overall, our order backlog at December 31, 2002 increased by $6.6 million as compared to December 31, 2001. This increase was due to new acquisitions having $6.9 million in backlog at December 31, 2002, partially offset by softness in the Industrial Technology segment. Net orders booked for the two months ended December 31, Order backlog as of December 31, 2002 2001 2002 2001 Instrumentation $ 29,433 $ 28,244 $ 18,873 $ 22,286 Industrial Technology 22,811 26,604 25,574 31,183 Energy Systems & Controls 14,254 6,824 25,902 18,426 Scientific & Industrial Imaging 28,780 26,371 46,999 38,874 $ 95,278 $ 88,043 $ 117,348 $ 110,769 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $164.8 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004, $71.3 million for the twelve months ended December 31, 2003, and $86.8 million for the twelve months ended October 31, 2002. 2003 results include a $24.4 million write off of debt extinguishment costs related to the recapitalization of the Company. The increase in 2004 over 2003 reflected stronger earnings from operations due to the inclusion of NTGH in 2004, strong internal growth, the non recurrence of debt extinguishment cash cost and low cash tax payments due to the utilization of certain domestic net operating losses for tax purposes. Cash flows used in investing activities during each of fiscal 2004, 2003, and 2002 were primarily business acquisition costs. Cash flows from financing activities during each of these years were largely debt repayments and borrowings for acquisitions. Financing activities in 2004 also included amending and restating our previous $625 million credit agreement with our current $1.055 billion credit agreement to increase capacity, lower borrowing costs, and improve other terms and conditions. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $209.7 million at December 31, 2004 compared to $170.4 million at December 31, 2003. We acquired approximately $53.2 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during 2004. Total debt was $891.9 million at December 31, 2004 (44.4% of total capital) compared to $651.1 million at December 31, 2003 (49.8% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2004 compared to December 31, 2003 was due to borrowings incurred at the end of the current year to fund the TransCore acquisition and replace the previous credit facility. Our $1.055 billion credit facility consists of a $655 million term loan and a $400 million revolving loan, both with five year maturities. At December 31, 2004, our debt consisted of $230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2034, and the $655 million term loan. The Company had $47.3 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2004. $45 million of the letters of credit were issued via the revolving loan, thereby reducing its remaining capacity to $355 million. We expect that our available borrowing capacity, combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses, will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions. We also have several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non U.S. businesses. In total, these smaller facilities do not represent a significant source of credit for us. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2004. Capital expenditures of $12.1 million, $10.4 million and $7.7 million were incurred during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. We expect capital expenditures in 2005 to be slightly higher due to the higher capital expenditure requirements of the newly acquired TransCore business. Description of Certain Indebtedness Senior Secured Credit Facility Concurrently with the closing of the TransCore acquisition and the common stock and debt offerings in December 2004, we entered into a $1.055 billion senior secured credit facility. This credit facility consists of a five year $655 million term loan and a five year $400 million revolving loan. Our credit facility requires us to prepay the term loan and, in certain cases, reduce the commitments under the revolving loan, upon the receipt of certain proceeds, including from certain asset sales, the incurrence of certain debt, and up to 75% of our excess cash flows unless we meet a consolidated total leverage ratio test. We are also required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loans. The facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes In December 2003, we issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%, resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After that date, we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable. Instead, after January 15, 2009, interest will be recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and will represent accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. As originally issued, each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 6.211 shares of our common stock (subject to adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we will have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. On November 19, 2004, the Company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the Company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the Notes, but would change how the conversion value is paid. In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the Notes converted and, at the Companys option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2009, January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes for cash at any time on or after January 15, 2009 at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the applicable redemption date. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following table quantifies our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2004 (dollars in thousands). Payments Due in Fiscal Contractual Cash Obligations Total 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Long term debt $ 891,891 $ 36,527 $ 34,673 $ 65,500 $ 98,250 $ 426,941 $ 230,000 Operating Leases 89,100 25,700 20,900 14,200 8,600 5,800 13,900 Total $ 980,991 $ 62,227 $ 55,573 $ 79,700 $ 106,850 $ 432,741 $ 243,900 Amounts Expiring in Fiscal Other Commercial Commitments TotalAmountCommitted 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Standby letters of credit and bank guarantees $ 47,295 $ 46,743 $ 149 $ 134 $ 139 $ 50 $ 80 At December 31, 2004 and 2003, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt at a high rate. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2005 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In January 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position No. FAS 106 1 (FSP 106 1) Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003, which provides temporary guidance concerning the recently enacted Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, requires presently enacted changes in laws that will take effect in future periods to be taken into account in measuring current period postretirement benefit cost and the accumulated projected benefit obligation. The implementation of FSP 106 1 had no material impact on the Company. The Emerging Issues Task Force issued EITF 03 6, Participating Securities and the Two Class Method under FASB Statement No. 128, Earnings per Share, effective for periods ending after March 31, 2004, regarding the computation of earnings per share by companies that have issued securities other than common stock that contractually entitle the holder to participate in dividends and earnings of the company when, and if, it declares dividends on its common stock. The Company does not have securities subject to the provisions of EITF 03 6 and, as such, the implementation of EITF 03 6 had no material impact on the Companys financial statements. The EITF reached final consensus on EITF 04 8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings per Share, which would require convertible debt with a market price contingency to be included in diluted EPS calculations. The consensus should be applied to reporting periods ending after December 15, 2004. During December 2004, management completed a consent solicitation to modify the conversion provisions on the companys convertible notes with the effect that they will not be required to be included in diluted EPS calculations pursuant to EITF 04 8. In November 2004, the FASB issued FAS 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of ARB No. 43 to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and material waste. The standard requires that abnormal amounts of these items be recognized as current period charges. FAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The implementation of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys Financial Statements. In December, 2004, the FASB issued FAS 123R, Share Based Payment (revised 2004) effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005. This standard requires unvested equity awards outstanding at the effective date to continue to be measured and charged to expense over the remaining requisite service (vesting) period as required by FAS 123. The Company will implement this standard effective July 1, 2005 and is currently evaluating the impact of this statement. The FASB issued FSP 109 1 and 109 2 related to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. FSP 109 1 provides guidance related to the accounting for special tax deductions on qualified production activities income FSP 109 2 provides companies with additional time to complete assessment of repatriation plans related to the one time deduction on certain repatriated foreign earnings as provided in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The FSPs were effective upon issuance on December 21, 2004. The Company is currently evaluating the impact of the new FSPs. Information About Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report includes and incorporates by reference forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In addition, we, or our executive officers on our behalf, may from time to time make forward looking statements in reports and other documents we file with the SEC or in connection with oral statements made to the press, potential investors or others. All statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements. The words estimate, project, intend, expect, believe, anticipate, and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our expected financial position, business, financing plans, business strategy, business prospects, revenues, working capital, liquidity, capital needs, interest costs and income, in each case relating to our company as a whole, as well as statements regarding acquisitions, potential acquisitions and the benefits of acquisitions, including with respect to the TransCore acquisition. Forward looking statements are estimates and projections reflecting our best judgment and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements. These statements are based on our managements beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. Examples of forward looking statements in this report include but are not limited to our expectations regarding our ability to generate operating cash flows and reduce debt and associated interest expense and our expectations regarding growth through acquisitions. Important assumptions relating to the forward looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding demand for our products, the cost, timing and success of product upgrades and new product introductions, raw materials costs, expected pricing levels, the timing and cost of expected capital expenditures, expected outcomes of pending litigation, competitive conditions, general economic conditions and expected synergies relating to acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. Although we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable, our expectations may prove to be incorrect. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in the forward looking statements include: our ability to integrate the TransCore acquisition businesses into our operations; any unforeseen liabilities associated with the TransCore businesses or future acquisitions; limitations on our business imposed by our indebtedness; reductions in our business with Gazprom; the success of our restructuring activities in reducing costs; unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates; difficulties associated with exports; risks and costs associated with our international sales and operations; difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses; increased directors and officers liability and other insurance costs; risk of rising interest rates; product liability and insurance risks; increased warranty exposure; future competition; the cyclical nature of our markets; reduction of business with large customers; risks associated with government contracts; changes in the supply of, or price for, parts and components; environmental compliance costs and liabilities; risks and costs associated with asbestos related litigation; potential write offs of our substantial intangible assets; our ability to successfully develop new products; failure to protect our technology; trade tariffs that may be applied due to the U.S. governments delay in complying with certain WTO directives; terrorist attacks; future health crises; and the factors discussed in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report under the heading Risk Factors. We believe these forward looking statements are reasonable. However, you should not place undue reliance on any forward looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Further, forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update publicly any of them in light of new information or future events. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2004, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. Our $1.055 billion senior credit facility contains $655 million variable rate term notes and a $400 million variable rate revolver. To reduce the financial risk of future rate increases, the Company entered into fixed rate swap agreements, including a $100 million agreement expiring January 6, 2006, and, subsequent to year end, a $250 million agreement expiring March 13, 2008. Our $230 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate. At December 31, 2004, there was no material difference between prevailing market rates and the fixed rate on our debt instruments. At December 31, 2004, Ropers outstanding variable rate borrowings under the $1.055 billion credit facility were $555 million. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $5.6 million (before accounting for the $250 million fixed rate swap agreement which we entered into subsequent to year end). Several Roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, British pounds, Danish krone or Japanese yen. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 36% of our total sales and 77% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar weakened against these European currencies during 2004 and was relatively stable compared to other currencies. The difference between 2004 operating results for these companies translated into U.S. dollars during 2004 and these operating results translated into U.S. dollars during 2003 was not material. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2004 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately $2.9 million. The changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during 2004 compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2003 resulted in an increase in net assets of $27.3 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $19.5 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. The trading price of Ropers common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial statements. The stock prices also influence the computation of the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.
