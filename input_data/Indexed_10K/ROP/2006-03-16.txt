ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OFFINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview We are a diversified industrial company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and industrial imaging products and software, industrial technology products, instrumentation products and services and radio frequency identification and satellite based communication technologies and related services. We market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including radio frequency (RF) applications, water, energy, research and medical, and other niche markets. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both bolt ons and new strategic platforms. We strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments. On February 25, 2005, we purchased Inovonics, a provider of 900 MHz radio frequency products primarily for security, sub metering and remote temperature monitoring applications. On June 17, 2005 we purchased CIVCO, a provider of diagnostic and therapeutic disposable products used in conjunction with ultrasound imaging for minimally invasive medical procedures primarily in urology, radiology and cardiology. On November 30, 2005, we purchased MEDTEC, which designs, develops and distributes enabling technologies essential for accurate diagnosis and treatment for cancer care. MEDTEC products include patient positioning devices, image guided therapy software, and related products and accessories. During the year ended December 31, 2005, our results of operations benefited from the TransCore acquisition made on December 13, 2004, the power generation business of R/D Tech purchased on June 7, 2004, and the partial year activities of Inovonics, CIVCO and MEDTEC. In conjunction with the acquisition of TransCore, a provider of technologies and related services in areas such as radio frequency identification (RFID), satellite based communication, mobile asset tracking, security applications and comprehensive toll system and processing services, we replaced our existing $625 million credit agreement, completed a public offering of 5,000,000 shares of our common stock, and entered into an amended and restated $1.055 billion credit agreement. An underwriters overallotment of 115,000 shares of our common stock was subsequently exercised and closed on December 28, 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2004, our results of operations benefited from the Neptune Technology Group Holdings, Inc. (NTGH) acquisition made on December 29, 2003 and the partial year activities of the power generation business of R/D Tech purchased on June 7, 2004. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2005 included elsewhere in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long lived assets, recognizing revenues and issuing stock options to employees. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our board of directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory utilization, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percent of completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite lived asset analyses. These issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2005, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $7.3 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $1.3 million, for a total of $8.6 million, or 3.2% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, the timing of write offs of accounts deemed uncollectible and is not significantly different as a percent of sales as compared to the December 31, 2004 level. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. Business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances. At December 31, 2005, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $24.3 million, or 15.4% of gross first in, first out inventory cost. This percentage has decreased from 16.1% in the fiscal year ended December 31, 2004. We expect this percentage to continue to decrease over time as we physically dispose of obsolete inventory. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. At December 31, 2005, the reserve for future warranty obligations was $6.6 million. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2005, December 31, 2004, and December 31, 2003. Revenues related to the use of the percentage of completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we recognized revenue of approximately $90.0 million using this method, primarily for major turn key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects. Approximately $16.8 million and $31.4 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the years ended December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, respectively. At December 31, 2005 approximately $100.0 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage of completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. We expected the significant increase in revenue related to the use of percentage of completion accounting in 2005 as TransCore has several longer term projects related to toll and traffic systems that require use of this method and we expect this higher level to continue in the future. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2005, our effective income tax rate was 30.6%, which included a $6.6 million reduction of tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code at an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings. In 2004, our effective income tax rate was 29.8% which included a $0.9 million additional R&D credit. We expect our tax rate in 2006 to increase to approximately 33.8% as the company does not expect a recurrence of 2005s reduction in tax expense from the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings. Roper accounts for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142) requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at June 30, 2001 and establishes a two step method for testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value). Roper conducts this review for all of its reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. No impairment resulted from the annual review performed in 2005. SFAS 142 also requires that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to have an indefinite useful economic life not be amortized, but separately tested for impairment using a one step fair value based approach. Total goodwill includes 24 different business units with individual amounts ranging from less than $1 million to approximately $416 million. Results of Operations General The following tables set forth selected information for the years indicated. Dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales. 12 months ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Net sales Instrumentation $ 232,916 $ 213,722 $ 181,329 Industrial Technology(1) 430,037 396,671 170,324 Energy Systems and Controls(2) 174,674 156,232 138,968 Scientific and Industrial Imaging(3) 219,530 187,926 166,735 RF Technology(4) 396,574 15,213 Total 1,453,731 969,764 657,356 Gross profit: Instrumentation 58.5 % 57.8 % 58.3 % Industrial Technology 44.1 42.6 45.6 Energy Systems and Controls 54.7 52.3 52.8 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 55.3 55.7 53.6 RF Technology 46.4 40.4 Total 50.0 50.0 52.7 Operating profit: Instrumentation 22.5 % 20.2 % 17.5 % Industrial Technology 22.5 20.7 21.2 Energy Systems and Controls 25.7 21.6 19.0 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 18.0 17.2 16.8 RF Technology 14.8 (0.1 ) Total 20.1 19.7 18.6 Corporate administrative expenses (1.9 )% (2.0 )% (2.2 )% Income from continuing operations 18.2 17.7 16.4 Interest expense (3.0 ) (3.0 ) (2.5 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt (0.3 ) (0.8 ) (3.8 ) Other income/(expense) 0.2 (0.1 ) Income from continuing operations before taxes and change in accounting principle 15.1 13.8 10.1 Income taxes (4.6 ) (4.1 ) (2.8 ) Loss on discontinued operations, net of taxes (0.4 ) Net earnings 10.5 % 9.7 % 6.9 % (1) Includes results of NTGH acquisition from December 29, 2003. (2) Includes results of the power generation business of R/D Tech from June 7, 2004. (3) Includes results of CIVCO from June 17, 2005, MEDTEC from November 30, 2005, the NTGH acquisition from December 29, 2003 and several smaller business acquired during the years presented. (4) Includes results of Inovonics from February 25, 2005 and TransCore from December 13, 2004. Year Ended December 31, 2005 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2004 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 were $1.45 billion as compared to sales of $969.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, an increase of 49.9%. This increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth. Our 2005 results included a full year of sales from the power generation business of R/D Tech and from TransCore, both acquired during 2004, approximately ten months of sales from the Inovonics acquisition, six months from CIVCO, and one month from MEDTEC. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $413 million of our 2005 net sales increase over 2004 and growth of our other business accounted for the remaining $71 million of the increase. In our Instrumentation segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased by $19.2 million or 9.0% over the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was due primarily to increased unit volumes attributable to generally favorable market conditions, increased sales of approximately $4 million in sulfur testing instruments as this testing moved from lab to process applications with our customers and increased sales of our non destructive testing technology into new channels representing approximately $2 million. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $33.4 million or 8.4% for the year ended December 31, 2005 over the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was due primarily to increased unit volumes attributable to generally favorable market conditions including strong sales growth in radio frequency technology in our water meter markets, representing approximately $10 million, and increased sales of standard products in our water and waste water pumps of approximately $5 million. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased by $18.4 million or 11.8% over the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was primarily due to the full year impact of the power generation business of R/D Tech acquired in 2004 of approximately $9.4 million. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of $31.6 million or 16.8% for the year ended December 31, 2005 over the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to the partial year impact of CIVCO and MEDTEC acquired in 2005 which accounted for approximately $22 million of the increase over prior year. The remainder of the increase resulted primarily from new products and more focused selling activities driving market penetration in our physical and life sciences camera markets. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 increased by $381.4 million over the year ended December 31, 2004. The increase was attributable to the full year results of TransCore, purchased December 13, 2004, and the ten month results of Inovonics. Our overall gross profit percentage was 50.0% for the year ended December 31, 2005 which remained the same as 50.0% for the year ended December 31, 2004. The Instrumentation segment gross margins increased to 58.5% as compared to 57.8% in the prior year. The margins improved due to sales mix and leverage from increased sales. Industrial Technology gross margins increased to 44.1% as compared to 42.6% in the prior year, primarily due to the non recurrence of inventory step up costs at Neptune in the first quarter of 2004 of approximately $1.5 million. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment gross margins were 54.7% in 2005 as compared to 52.3% in 2004. This was due to several factors none of which are easily quantifiable, including a product rationalization effort in our non destructive testing business, better large project scope acceptance discipline and better engineering staff utilization in our oil and gas business. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 55.3% in 2005 as compared to 55.7% in 2004. This decrease is due totally to inventory step up costs of approximately $2.1 million at CIVCO and MEDTEC incurred in 2005. Without these charges, there was a modest improvement in this segments gross margins for the year. Our RF Technology segment gross margins were 46.4% in 2005 as compared to 40.4% for the 18 day period that TransCore was owned in 2004. Prior year gross margins were depressed due to the low sales volume in the holiday period of our ownership in the prior year. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased to 31.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005 from 32.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004. The decrease is due to leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and administrative expenses. Interest expense increased $14.5 million, or 50.4%, for the year ended December 31, 2005 compared to the year ended December 31, 2004, primarily as a result of higher debt levels incurred due to the TransCore acquisition in December 2004, and borrowings under our revolving credit facility for the Inovonics, CIVCO and MEDTEC acquisitions in 2005. The loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2005 was a $3.9 million non cash charge related to the expensing of deferred financing costs for our senior subordinated convertible notes which are required to be classified as short term debt, based upon the triggering of the conversion feature of the notes due to increases in the trading price of the Companys stock. The loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2004 was a $8.2 million non cash charge related to the expensing of deferred financing costs due to the amendment of our credit facility concurrent with the acquisition of TransCore. The change in other income for the year ended December 31, 2005 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2004 was primarily due to a $0.8 million gain on sale of an investment in a previously owned business and proceeds of $0.7 million from a business interruption insurance claim due to a fire at a supplier to one of our Imaging segment businesses. During 2005, our effective income tax rate was 30.6%, which included a $6.6 million reduction to tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code at an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings. In 2004, our effective income tax rate was 29.8% which included a $0.9 million additional R&D credit. We expect our tax rate in 2006 to increase to approximately 33.8% as the company does not expect a recurrence of the 2005 reduction in tax expense from the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings. At December 31, 2005, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were weaker and the functional currencies of our Canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2004. The net result of these changes led to a decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $27.9 million in the year period ending December 31, 2005. Approximately $21.8 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2005, operating profit was not affected by fluctuations in non U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2005 2004 change Instrumentation $ 236,121 $ 215,821 9.4 % Industrial Technology 440,908 386,488 14.1 Energy Systems and Controls 178,393 170,459 4.7 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 230,434 182,887 26.0 RF Technology 408,825 15,213 n/m Total $ 1,494,681 $ 970,868 54.0 % Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year and in particular from strong orders for Neptune water meter and RF products, which is also the primary contributor to the increased backlog in this segment as noted in the table below. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders increased from the inclusion of orders from the partial year ownership of CIVCO and MEDTEC and also from stronger orders for industrial cameras and handheld computers, which leads to the higher backlog at 2005 in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2005 and 2004 (dollar amounts in thousands). Ropers policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2005 2004 change Instrumentation $ 21,881 $ 20,310 7.7 % Industrial Technology 58,488 50,004 17.0 Energy Systems and Controls 45,489 45,076 0.9 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 54,290 36,835 47.4 RF Technology 200,233 183,742 9.0 Total $ 380,381 $ 335,967 13.2 % Year Ended December 31, 2004 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2003 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 were $969.8 million as compared to sales of $657.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, an increase of 47.5%. This increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth. Our 2004 results included a full year of sales from the NTGH acquisition, six months of sales from the power generation business of R/D Tech and two weeks of sales from the TransCore acquisition. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $252 million of our 2004 net sales increase over 2003 and growth of our other business accounted for the remaining $60 million of the increase. In our Instrumentation segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 increased by $32.4 million or 17.9% over the year ended December 31, 2003. The increase was attributable to improved distribution, new product introductions, favorable market conditions, and changes in exchange rates. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $226.3 million or 132.9% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The increase primarily resulted from the NTGH acquisition, accounting for approximately $206 million of the increase, and also included stronger sales into industrial, energy, and commercial refrigeration end markets. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 increased by $17.3 million or 12.4% over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. The increase was due to the partial year impact of the power generation business of R/D Tech acquired in 2004 of approximately $10 million as well as higher system and product sales of energy applications, substantially offset by lower sales to Gazprom. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of $21.2 million or 12.7% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 over the twelve months ended December 31, 2003. Approximately $20 million of the increase was attributable to the full year impact of NTGH acquired in 2003. Our RF Technology segment was established in the fourth quarter of 2004 with the acquisition of TransCore on December 13, 2004 and includes two weeks of sales in 2004. Our overall gross profit percentage was 50.0% for the year ended December 31, 2004 as compared to 52.7% for the year ended December 31, 2003. Instrumentation segment gross margins decreased to 57.8% as compared to 58.3% in the prior year. The margins were impacted by increased sales of third party sourced products that carried a lower gross profit margin, but good operating profit margins. As expected, Industrial Technology gross margins decreased, to 42.6% as compared to 45.6% in the prior year, because NTGH gross margins are lower than the segment average. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment gross margins were 52.3% in 2004 as compared to 52.8% in 2003. This was due to a margin decrease in our turbomachinery controls business offset by an increase in margins in our non destructive testing business. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 55.7% in 2004 as compared to 53.6% in 2003. This increase is due to improved margins in our high performance digital imaging cameras and electron microscopes, much of which was achieved through the restructuring efforts undertaken in 2003. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased to 32.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2004 from 36.2% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2003. The decrease is due to leverage from higher sales levels and the reductions in restructuring expenses that were incurred in the prior year. This was offset with increased expenses related to compliance with the Sarbanes Oxley Act. Interest expense increased $12.5 million, or 76.1%, for the year ended December 31, 2004 compared to the year ended December 31, 2003, as a result of higher debt levels incurred due to the NTGH acquisition in December 2003. Income taxes were 29.8% of pretax earnings in 2004 compared to 27.5% for 2003. Our 2003 rate was low due to the marginal rate impact in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 of certain expenses related to the NTGH acquisition and related financing. Our 2004 rate also included an additional $0.9 million credit related to a R&D study completed during the year. At December 31, 2004, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2003. This strengthening resulted in an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $27.3 million in the twelve month period ending December 31, 2004. Approximately $19.5 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. 2004 operating earnings benefited 1.9% from stronger non U.S. currencies. Foreign exchange differences related to our other non U.S. subsidiaries were immaterial to 2004 financial performance. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2004 2003 change Instrumentation $ 215,821 $ 178,255 21.1 % Industrial Technology 386,488 168,798 129.0 Energy Systems and Controls 170,459 143,933 18.4 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 182,887 154,538 18.3 RF Technology 15,213 n.m. Total $ 970,868 $ 645,524 50.4 % Instrumentation segment net orders improved due to continued strength for oil and gas desulfurization applications and higher orders for our materials analysis equipment. In addition, approximately 5.1% of the increase was due to the stronger European and Asian currencies against the dollar. Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened over all markets from the prior year and also benefited from the orders for Neptune which were not included in the prior year. Energy Systems and Controls net orders rose due to strength in the non destructive testing markets as well as the inclusion of the orders of the power generation business of R/D Tech which is included for almost seven months of the current year. In addition, there was continued strength in non Gazprom oil and gas sectors, offset by significantly lower Gazprom orders. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders increased from strong orders for electron microscopy products. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2004 and 2003 (dollar amounts in thousands). Ropers policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2004 2003 change Instrumentation $ 20,310 $ 17,068 19.0 % Industrial Technology 50,004 58,024 13.8 Energy Systems and Controls 45,076 30,989 45.5 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 36,835 42,482 13.3 RF Technology 183,742 Total $ 335,967 $ 148,563 126.1 % The increase in backlog is due primarily to the inclusion of the TransCore backlog of firm orders which can be shipped within twelve months. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $281.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, $164.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, and $71.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2003. 2003 results include a $24.4 million write off of debt extinguishment costs related to the recapitalization of the Company. The 2005 increase reflects stronger earnings from operations due to the inclusion of TransCore, Inovonics, CIVCO, & MEDTEC in 2005, strong growth from our other operations, and lower cash tax payments due primarily to the utilization of certain U.S. net operating losses for tax purposes. Cash flows used in investing activities during each of fiscal 2005, 2004, and 2003 were primarily business acquisition costs. Cash flows from financing activities during each of these years were largely debt repayments and borrowings for acquisitions and common stock issuances in 2004 and 2003. Financing activities in 2004 also included amending and restating our previous $625 million credit agreement with our current $1.055 billion credit agreement to increase capacity, lower borrowing costs, and improve other terms and conditions. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $212.8 million at December 31, 2005 compared to $209.7 million at December 31, 2004. We acquired approximately $21.7 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during 2005. Total debt was $894.3 million at December 31, 2005 (41.7% of total capital) compared to $891.9 million at December 31, 2004 (44.4% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2005 compared to December 31, 2004 was due to borrowings related to our 2005 acquisitions. Our $1.055 billion credit facility consists of a $655 million term loan and a $400 million revolving loan, both with five year maturities. At December 31, 2005, our debt consisted of $230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2034, a balance of $616.8 million on the term loan and a balance of $40.1 million on the revolving loan. The Company had $44.5 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2005, thereby reducing its remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately. We expect that our available borrowing capacity, combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses, will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions. We also have several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non U.S. businesses. In total, these smaller facilities do not represent a significant source of credit for us. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2005. Capital expenditures of $24.8 million, $12.1 million and $10.4 million were incurred during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in capital expenditures in 2005 was primarily due to the higher capital expenditure requirements of TransCore acquired in December, 2004. We expect capital expenditures in 2006 to be approximately comparable as a percentage of sales to 2005. Description of Certain Indebtedness Senior Secured Credit Facility Concurrently with the closing of the TransCore acquisition and the common stock offering in December 2004, we entered into a $1.055 billion senior secured credit facility. This credit facility consists of a five year $655 million term loan and a five year $400 million revolving loan. Our credit facility requires us to prepay the term loan and, in certain cases, reduce the commitments under the revolving loan, upon the receipt of certain proceeds, including from certain asset sales, the incurrence of certain debt, and up to 75% of our excess cash flows unless we meet a consolidated total leverage ratio test. We are also required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loans. The facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes In December 2003, we issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%, resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After that date, we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable. Instead, after January 15, 2009, interest will be recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and will represent accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. As originally issued, each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12.422 shares of our common stock (giving effect to the 2 for 1 stock split effective August 26, 2005 and subject to further adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we would have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. On November 19, 2004, the Company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the Company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the Notes, but would change how the conversion value is paid. In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the Notes converted and, at the Companys option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2009, January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time on or after January 15, 2009 at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the applicable redemption date. As of September 30, 2005, the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on October 1, 2005 based upon the Companys common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on September 30, 2005. In accordance with EITF 04 8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings Per Share, the Company is required to include in its diluted weighted average common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between the Companys average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.80. This is calculated using the treasury stock method. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following table quantifies our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2005 (dollars in thousands). Payments Due in Fiscal Contractual Cash Obligations Total 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Long term debt* $ 890,774 $ 271,376 $ 65,502 $ 98,250 $ 455,646 $ $ Capital leases 3,497 1,937 1,120 368 59 13 Operating leases 82,524 20,167 15,788 11,358 8,653 6,140 20,418 Total $ 976,795 $ 293,480 $ 82,410 $ 109,976 $ 464,358 $ 6,153 $ 20,418 *Includes in 2006 $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes which are recorded as a current liability however, the Company does not expect note holders to exercise their conversion rights within the next 12 months. Amounts Expiring in Fiscal Other Commercial Commitments TotalAmountCommitted 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Standby letters of credit and bank guarantees $ 44,489 $ 40,093 $ 3,347 $ 209 $ 287 $ 553 $ At December 31, 2005 the Company had outstanding surety bonds of $118.9 million. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2006 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In November 2004, the FASB issued FAS 151, Inventory Costs An Amendment of ARB No. 43 to clarify the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and material waste. The standard requires that abnormal amounts of these items be recognized as current period charges. FAS 151 is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The implementation of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Companys Financial Statements. In December, 2004, the FASB issued FAS 123R, Share Based Payment (revised 2004) (SFAS 123R) which was originally effective for interim or annual reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The effective date of this standard has been delayed until annual reporting periods beginning after December 31, 2005, which was the companys calendar year 2006 beginning on January 1, 2006. SFAS 123R applies to any unvested awards that are outstanding on the effective date and to all new awards granted or modified after the effective date. The remaining unrecognized portion of the original fair value of the unvested awards will be recognized in the income statement at their fair value that the company estimated for purposes of preparing its SFAS 123 pro forma disclosures. The company adopted SFAS 123R on January 1, 2006 and applied the modified prospective transition method. This method requires the company to expense the remaining unrecognized portion of awards outstanding at the effective date and to expense any awards granted or modified after the effective date, but does not require restatement of prior periods. In accordance with FASB Staff Position FAS 123(R) 3, Transition Election to Accounting for the Tax Effects of Share Based Payment Awards, the company anticipates applying the short cut method for determining its Additional Paid in Capital Pool, however the company continues to evaluate such implementation. As a result of the adoption of SFAS 123R as of January 1, 2006, the company estimates it will record expense of approximately $3.5 million in fiscal 2006 relating to its stock based awards. The FASB issued FSP 109 1 and 109 2 related to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. FSP 109 1 provides guidance related to the accounting for special tax deductions on qualified production activities income. FSP 109 2 provides companies with additional time to complete assessment of repatriation plans related to the one time deduction on certain repatriated foreign earnings as provided in the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004. The FSPs were effective upon issuance on December 21, 2004. The Act creates a temporary incentive for U.S. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85 percent dividend received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign corporations. The Company repatriated approximately $82 million of foreign sourced earnings during the fourth quarter of 2005 which resulted in a net tax benefit of approximately $6.6 million and is reflected in the Companys effective tax rate in the fourth quarter. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, (FIN 47) to clarify the requirement to record liabilities stemming from a legal obligation to perform an asset retirement activity in which the timing or method of settlement is conditional on a future event. FIN 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005. The implementation of this standard did not have a material impact on the Companys Financial Statements. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154 (SFAS 154), Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. SFAS 154 requires that, when a company changes its accounting policies, it must apply the change retrospectively to all prior periods presented, unless impracticable, instead of a cumulative effect adjustment in the period of the change. SFAS 154 may also apply when the FASB issues new rules requiring changes in accounting. However, if the new rule allows cumulative effect treatment, it would take precedence over SFAS 154. This statement is effective for accounting changes and error corrections beginning in the companys calendar year 2006 which began on January 1, 2006. In June 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position 143 1, Accounting for Electronic Equipment Waste Obligations (FSP 143 1), which provides guidance on the accounting for certain obligations associated with the Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (the Directive), adopted by the European Union (EU). Under the Directive, the waste management obligation for historical equipment (products put on the market on or prior to August 13, 2005) remains with the commercial user until the customer replaces the equipment. FSP 143 1 is required to be applied to the later of the first reporting period ending after June 8, 2005 or the date of the Directives adoption into law by the applicable EU member countries in which the manufacturers have significant operations. The Company adopted FSP 143 1 in the third quarter of fiscal 2005 and its adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial condition for fiscal 2005. Information About Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report includes and incorporates by reference forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In addition, we, or our executive officers on our behalf, may from time to time make forward looking statements in reports and other documents we file with the SEC or in connection with oral statements made to the press, potential investors or others. All statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements. The words estimate, project, intend, expect, believe, anticipate, and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our expected financial position, business, financing plans, business strategy, business prospects, revenues, working capital, liquidity, capital needs, interest costs and income, in each case relating to our company as a whole, as well as statements regarding acquisitions, potential acquisitions and the benefits of acquisitions. Forward looking statements are estimates and projections reflecting our best judgment and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements. These statements are based on our managements beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. Examples of forward looking statements in this report include but are not limited to our expectations regarding our ability to generate operating cash flows and reduce debt and associated interest expense and our expectations regarding growth through acquisitions. Important assumptions relating to the forward looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding demand for our products, the cost, timing and success of product upgrades and new product introductions, raw materials costs, expected pricing levels, the timing and cost of expected capital expenditures, expected outcomes of pending litigation, competitive conditions, general economic conditions and expected synergies relating to acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. Although we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable, our expectations may prove to be incorrect. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in the forward looking statements include: difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses; any unforeseen liabilities associated with future acquisitions; limitations on our business imposed by our indebtedness; unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates; difficulties associated with exports; risks and costs associated with our international sales and operations; increased directors and officers liability and other insurance costs; risk of rising interest rates; product liability and insurance risks; increased warranty exposure; future competition; the cyclical nature of some of our markets; reduction of business with large customers; risks associated with government contracts; changes in the supply of, or price for, parts and components; environmental compliance costs and liabilities; risks and costs associated with asbestos related litigation; potential write offs of our substantial intangible assets; our ability to successfully develop new products; failure to protect our technology; trade tariffs that may be applied due to the U.S. governments delay in complying with certain WTO directives; terrorist attacks; future health crises; and the factors discussed in Item 1A to this Annual Report under the heading "Risk Factors." We believe these forward looking statements are reasonable. However, you should not place undue reliance on any forward looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Further, forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update any of them in light of new information or future events. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2005, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. Our $1.055 billion senior credit facility contains $655 million variable rate term notes and a $400 million variable rate revolver. To reduce the financial risk of future rate increases, in 2005 the Company entered into a $250 million fixed rate swap agreement expiring March 13, 2008. Our $230 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate. At December 31, 2005, the prevailing market rates were between 0.75% and 1.75% higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. At December 31, 2005, Ropers outstanding variable rate borrowings not covered by the interest rate swap under the $1.055 billion credit facility were $406.9 million. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $4.1 million. Several Roper companies have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds, Danish krone or Japanese yen. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 25% of our total sales and 66% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar strengthened against European and Asian currencies during 2005 and weakened against the Canadian dollar. The difference between 2005 operating results for these companies translated into U.S. dollars during 2005 and these operating results translated into U.S. dollars during 2005 was not material. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2005 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately $2.5 million. The changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during 2005 compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2004 resulted in a decrease in net assets of $27.9 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $21.8 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. The trading price of Ropers common stock influences the valuation of stock option grants and the effects these grants have on pro forma earnings disclosed in our financial statements. The stock prices also influence the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.
