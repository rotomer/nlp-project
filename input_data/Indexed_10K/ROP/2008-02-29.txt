ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report. Overview We are a diversified growth company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and industrial imaging products and software, industrial technology products and radio frequency (RF) products and services. We market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including RF applications, water, energy, research and medical, security and other niche markets. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both bolt ons and new strategic platforms. We strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments. On February 21, 2007, we purchased JLT, a provider of rugged computers and software for mobile computing. On February 28, 2007, we purchased DJ Instruments, a manufacturer and provider of pressure measurement sensors. On March 22, 2007, we purchased Roda Deaco, a developer and manufacturer of air intake cut off devices. On June 21, 2007, we purchased Dynamic Instruments, a provider of audio recording, vibration monitoring and process control equipment for commercial and military markets. On September 24, 2007, we purchased Black Diamond, a provider of rugged mobile computers. The results of DJ Instruments, Roda Deaco and Dynamic Instruments are reported in the Energy Systems and Controls segment, JLT in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment, and Black Diamond in the RF Technology segment. During the year ended December 31, 2007, our results of operations benefited from the full year results of the 2006 acquisitions of Intellitrans and Sinmed in April, AC Controls in July, Lumenera in August and Dynisco in November, as well as the partial year activities of JLT, DJ Instruments, Roda Deaco, Dynamic Instruments and Black Diamond. During the year ended December 31, 2006, our results of operations benefited from the full year results of the 2005 acquisitions of Inovonics, CIVCO and MEDTEC in February, June and November, respectively, as well as the partial year activities of Intellitrans, Sinmed, AC Controls, Lumenera and Dynisco. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, or GAAP. A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2007 included elsewhere in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which requires the Company to recognize expense for the grant date fair value of its employee stock option awards. The Company recognizes the expense of all share based awards on a straight line basis over the employees requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). On January 1, 2007 the Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109. This Interpretation requires the Company to recognize in the consolidated financial statements only those tax positions determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the positions. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory utilization, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percent of completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite lived asset analyses. These issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2007, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $10.3 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $1.6 million, for a total of $11.9 million, or 3.2% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. The total allowance at December 31, 2007 is $2.9 million higher than at December 31, 2006 and has increased slightly as a percent of sales by .04%. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. Business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances. At December 31, 2007, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $28.4 million, or 14.0% of gross inventory cost. This percentage has increased from 13.5% at December 31, 2006. The inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of our obsolete inventory. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. At December 31, 2007, the reserve for future warranty obligations was $8.5 million. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005. Revenues related to the use of the percentage of completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recognized revenue of approximately $135.5 million using this method, primarily for major turn key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects. Approximately $94.8 million and $90.0 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the years ended December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, respectively. At December 31, 2007, approximately $133.6 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage of completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and how and when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2007, our effective income tax rate was 34.8%, which was higher than the 2006 rate of 34.0%. Roper accounts for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142) requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at June 30, 2001 and establishes a two step method for testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value). Total goodwill includes 22 different business components with individual amounts ranging from zero to approximately $451 million. SFAS 142 also requires that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to have an indefinite useful economic life not be amortized, but separately tested for impairment using a one step fair value based approach. Roper conducts these reviews for all of its reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. No impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2007. Results of Operations General The following tables set forth selected information for the years indicated. Dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales. Results from 2005 have been revised to conform to the current segment presentation. Years ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Net sales Industrial Technology $ 644,436 $ 549,993 $ 496,060 Energy Systems and Controls(1) 516,420 343,699 311,199 Scientific and Industrial Imaging(2) 376,163 338,906 249,898 RF Technology(3) 565,030 468,136 396,574 Total $ 2,102,049 $ 1,700,734 $ 1,453,731 Gross profit: Industrial Technology 48.2 % 47.9 % 47.4 % Energy Systems and Controls 53.6 54.2 54.2 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 54.9 56.8 55.6 RF Technology 46.8 46.8 46.4 Total 50.4 50.6 50.0 Operating profit: Industrial Technology 25.6 % 23.4 % 21.2 % Energy Systems and Controls 24.5 26.3 25.9 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 19.5 21.4 19.2 RF Technology 20.7 17.3 14.8 Total 22.9 21.9 20.1 Corporate administrative expenses (2.0 )% (2.0 )% (1.9 )% Income from continuing operations 20.9 19.9 18.2 Interest expense (2.5 ) (2.6 ) (3.0 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt (0.3 ) Other income/(expense) (0.1 ) 0.2 Income from continuing operations before taxes and change in accounting principle 18.3 17.3 15.1 Income taxes (6.4 ) (5.9 ) (4.6 ) Net earnings 11.9 % 11.4 % 10.5 % (1) Includes results from the acquisitions of DJ Instruments from February 28, 2007, Roda Deaco from March 22, 2007, Dynamic Instruments from June 21, 2007, AC Controls from August 8, 2006 and Dynisco from November 30, 2006. (2) Includes results from the acquisitions of JLT from February 21, 2007, Sinmed from April 5, 2006, Lumenera from July 25, 2006, CIVCO from June 17, 2005, MEDTEC from November 30, 2005 and several smaller business acquired during the years presented. (3) Includes results from the acquisitions of Black Diamond from September 24, 2007, Intellitrans from April 26, 2006 and Inovonics from February 25, 2005. Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $2.10 billion as compared to sales of $1.70 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 23.6%. This increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth. Our 2007 results included a full year of sales from our 2006 acquisitions of Sinmed, Intellitrans, Lumenera, AC Controls, and Dynisco. These results also included ten months of sales from JLT and DJ Instruments, nine months from Roda Deaco, six months from Dynamic Instruments and three months from Black Diamond, all purchased in 2007. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $158 million of our 2007 net sales increase over 2006 and growth of our other business accounted for $243 million of the increase, or internal growth of 14.5% including a 2% foreign currency exchange impact. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $94.4 million or 17.2% for the year ended December 31, 2007 over the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was due primarily to high market penetration for our new radio frequency integrated water meter at Neptune Technologies, accounting for 63% of the year over year growth. In addition, sales in our materials testing businesses were up $19 million over the prior year due to increased unit sales. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by $172.7 million or 50.3% over the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $127 million of the increase was due to full year results from the 2006 acquisitions of AC Controls and Dynisco, as well as partial year results for DJ Instruments, Roda Deaco, and Dynamic Instruments. Internal growth was approximately $45 million or 14%, primarily from strength in the oil and gas related businesses, which have benefited from the strong global oil and gas market, as well as improved market penetration in our control valve business. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of $37.3 million or 11.0% for the year ended December 31, 2007 over the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was attributable to the full year impact of Sinmed and Lumenera acquired in 2006, and partial year impact of JLT in 2007, which accounted for approximately $23 million of the increase over prior year. Internal growth was 4.2%, which was related to increased sales in the electron microscopy market due to higher demand from OEM customers, offset by weakness in our motion camera product line and decreased sales of handheld computers due to supplier issues encountered during the year. The supplier issues have been resolved and we do not expect an adverse impact from these supplier issues going into 2008. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by $96.9 million or 20.7% over the year ended December 31, 2006. The full year results of Intellitrans, purchased in April, 2006, and four months from the acquisition of Black Diamond on September 24, 2007, accounted for approximately $7 million of the increase. Internal growth increased 19.3% due to strong performance in our traffic and tolling business, which benefited in the current year from a large Middle East project which will continue into 2008. Our overall gross profit percentage was 50.4% for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 50.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Industrial Technology gross margins increased to 48.2% as compared to 47.9% in the prior year. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment gross margins decreased to 53.6% in 2007 as compared to 54.2% in 2006, due to the mix change within the segment caused by the inclusion of the lower gross margin Dynisco business. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 54.9% in 2007 as compared to 56.8% in 2006, due primarily to the additional costs related to the DAP touch screen quality issue. Our RF Technology segment gross margins remained constant at 46.8% in both 2007 and 2006. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased to 29.5% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 from 30.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease is due to leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and administrative expenses.Interest expense increased $7.4 million, or 16.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to higher average debt balances throughout 2007 related to the November 30, 2006 acquisition of Dynisco, and additional borrowings throughout the year for the 2007 acquisitions offset by payments on these balances throughout the year. The change in other income for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily due to foreign exchange losses at our non U.S. based companies on U.S. dollar cash, receivables and payables balances as the U.S. dollar weakened against most currencies in 2007. During 2007, our effective income tax rate was 34.8% versus 34.0% in 2006. This increase was due primarily to the expiration of the extraterritorial income inclusion offset somewhat by an increased benefit from our foreign rate differential. At December 31, 2007, the functional currencies of our European and Canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2006. The net result of these changes led to an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $52.3 million in the year period ending December 31, 2007. Approximately $34.8 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2007, operating profit increased by approximately 1% of sales due to fluctuations in non U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2007 2006 change Industrial Technology $ 639,348 $ 589,322 8.5 % Energy Systems and Controls 525,899 346,880 51.6 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 377,653 341,178 10.7 RF Technology 575,100 511,188 12.5 Total $ 2,118,000 $ 1,788,568 18.4 % The increase in sales orders is due to internal growth of 9.7% with the remainder from acquisitions. The Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year. Net orders in the Energy Systems and Controls segment increased due to the 2006 and 2007 acquisitions, which accounted for 38.7% of the increase. In addition, there was strong internal growth in our fluid properties testing, non destructive testing and valve and control businesses. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders increased from the inclusion of orders from 2006 and 2007 acquisitions, and also from stronger orders in the electron microscopy market, which led to the higher backlog at 2007 in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment. The RF Technology segment experienced strong order growth including a significant international project which began in the fourth quarter of 2006 and continued throughout 2007. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2007 and 2006 (dollar amounts in thousands). Ropers policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2007 2006 change Industrial Technology $ 93,076 $ 95,539 (2.6 )% Energy Systems and Controls 93,102 79,217 17.5 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 74,834 68,600 9.1 RF Technology 271,305 261,243 3.9 Total $ 532,317 $ 504,599 5.5 % Year Ended December 31, 2006 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2005 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 were $1.70 billion as compared to sales of $1.45 billion for the year ended December 31, 2005, an increase of 17.0%. This increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth. Our 2006 results included a full year of sales from Inovonics, CIVCO and MEDTEC acquired during 2005, approximately eight months of sales from Sinmed, seven months from Intellitrans, five months from Lumenera and AC Controls, and one month from Dynisco. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $101 million of our 2006 net sales increase over 2005 and growth of our other business accounted for the remaining $146 million of the increase. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $53.9 million or 10.9% for the year ended December 31, 2006 over the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was due primarily to high market penetration for our new radio frequency integrated water meter at Neptune Technologies, accounting for 68% of the year over year growth. In addition, sales in our materials testing businesses were up $11 million dollars over the prior year due to increased unit sales. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased by $32.5 million or 10.4% over the year ended December 31, 2005. Approximately $19 million, or 6%, of the increase was due to the 2006 acquisitions of AC Controls and Dynisco. Internal growth was approximately $14 million or 4.4%, primarily from strength in the oil and gas related businesses which benefited from the strong global oil and gas market, offset by weak sales at Zetec in the first half of 2006. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of $89.0 million or 35.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006 over the year ended December 31, 2005. The increase was attributable to the full year impact of CIVCO and MEDTEC acquired in 2005, and partial year impact of Sinmed and Lumenera in 2006, which accounted for approximately $65 million of the increase over prior year. Internal growth was 9.7%, approximately 50% of which was related to increased sales in the electron microscopy market due to higher demand from OEM customers. Sales of new products in the digital camera businesses accounted for the remainder of the growth. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased by $71.6 million or 18.0% over the year ended December 31, 2005. The full year results of Inovonics, purchased in February 2005, and eight months from the Intellitrans acquisition on April 26, 2006, accounted for approximately $17 million of the increase. Internal growth increased 13.8% due to strong performance in the freight matching business and our traffic and tolling business. Our overall gross profit percentage was 50.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006, as compared to 50.0% for the year ended December 31, 2005. Industrial Technology gross margins increased to 47.9% as compared to 47.4% in the prior year. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment gross margins were unchanged at 54.2% in both 2006 and 2005, however, there was a $1.1 million purchase accounting inventory step up charge incurred in 2006. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 56.8% in 2006 as compared to 55.6% in 2005. There were purchase accounting inventory step up charges of $1.3 million in 2006 and $2.1 million in 2005. Excluding these charges, our gross margins would have increased in 2006 due to a larger percentage of segment sales in our higher margin medical businesses. Our RF Technology segment gross margins were 46.8% in 2006 as compared to 46.4% in 2005. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses decreased to 30.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006 from 31.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2005. The decrease was due to leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and administrative expenses. Interest expense increased $1.4 million, or 3.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily as a result of borrowings under our revolving credit facility for the Dynisco acquisition on November 30, 2006. The average debt balances and associated interest expense for the remaining 2006 acquisitions were relatively unchanged from the average debt balances and associated interest expense related to 2005 acquisitions. The loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2005 created a $3.9 million non cash charge related to the expensing of deferred financing costs for our senior subordinated convertible notes which were required to be classified as short term debt, based upon the triggering of the conversion feature of the notes due to increases in the trading price of the Companys stock. The change in other income for the year ended December 31, 2006 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2005 was primarily due to the 2005 $0.8 million gain on sale of an investment in a previously owned business and proceeds of $0.7 million from a business interruption insurance claim due to a fire at a supplier to one of our Imaging segment businesses that did not recur in 2006. During 2006, our effective income tax rate was 34.0%. In 2005, our effective income tax rate was 30.6% which included a $6.6 million reduction to tax expense related to the repatriation of foreign sourced earnings under section 965 of the Internal Revenue Code at an effective tax rate significantly lower than previously provided on these earnings. As described above, our tax rate in 2007 increased to 34.9% as the Company continues to have a higher percentage of sales in the U.S. subject to additional state income tax. At December 31, 2006, the functional currencies of our European and Canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2005. The net result of these changes led to an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $23.6 million in the year period ending December 31, 2006. Approximately $20.7 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2006, operating profit increased by 1% of sales due to fluctuations in non U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2006 2005 change Industrial Technology $ 589,322 $ 500,479 17.8 % Energy Systems and Controls 346,880 322,038 7.7 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 341,178 263,339 29.6 RF Technology 511,188 408,825 25.0 Total $ 1,788,568 $ 1,494,681 19.7 % The increase in sales orders was due to internal growth of 12.7% with the remainder from acquisitions. The Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year and in particular from strong orders for Neptune water meter and RF products, which was also the primary contributor to the increased backlog in this segment as noted in the table below. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders increased from the inclusion of orders from the partial year ownership of Sinmed and Lumenera and also from stronger orders in the electron microscopy market, which led to the higher backlog at 2006 in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment. The RF Technology segment experienced strong order growth including a significant international project awarded in the fourth quarter of 2006 leading to the increased backlog in this segment. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2006 and 2005 (dollar amounts in thousands). Ropers policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2006 2005 change Industrial Technology $ 95,539 $ 54,959 73.8 % Energy Systems and Controls 79,217 63,583 24.6 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 68,600 61,606 11.4 RF Technology 261,243 200,233 30.5 Total $ 504,599 $ 380,381 32.7 % Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $343.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, $262.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006 and $281.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2005. The 2007 increase was primarily due to higher earnings over the prior year and increased amortization of identifiable intangible assets related to our acquisitions. Cash used by investing activities during 2007, 2006, and 2005 were primarily business acquisition costs. Cash from financing activities during each of these years was largely debt repayments and borrowings for acquisitions. Financing activities in 2007 included a $300 million increase to our current $1.055 billion credit agreement by exercise of an accordion feature of the agreement, increasing the total to $1.355 billion. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $305.9 million at December 31, 2007 compared to $270.3 million at December 31, 2006. We acquired approximately $7.5 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during 2007. Total debt was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007 (37.2% of total capital) compared to $1.0 billion at December 31, 2006 (40.8% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2007 compared to December 31, 2006 was due to borrowings related to the exercise of the accordion feature of the credit facility to increase the Companys liquidity. Our $1.355 billion credit facility consists of a $955 million term loan and a $400 million revolving loan, both with five year maturities. In 2005, the Company entered into a fixed rate swap agreement ending on March 13, 2008 which fixes the interest rate on $250 million of our term notes. The weighted average interest rate on the variable portion of our term loan at December 31, 2007 was 5.75%. At December 31, 2007, our debt consisted of $230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2034 and a balance of $823.7 million on the term loan. In addition, we had $4.8 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non U.S. businesses. The Company had $56.3 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2007, thereby reducing its remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately. We expect that our available borrowing capacity, combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses, will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2007. Capital expenditures of $30.1 million, $32.2 million and $24.8 million were incurred during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In 2008, we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be comparable to 2007. Description of Certain Indebtedness Senior Secured Credit Facility In December 2004, we entered into a $1.055 billion senior secured credit facility which consisted of a five year $655 million term loan and a five year $400 million revolving loan. The credit agreement contained a $300 million term loan accordion which was exercised in December 2007, thereby increasing the term loan balance to $955 million and the credit facility to $1.355 billion. Our credit facility requires us to prepay the term loan and, in certain cases, reduce the commitments under the revolving loan, upon the receipt of certain proceeds, including from certain asset sales, the incurrence of certain debt, and up to 75% of our excess cash flows unless we meet a consolidated total leverage ratio test. We are also required to make quarterly principal payments on the term loans. The facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes In December 2003, we issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%, resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After that date, we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable. Instead, after January 15, 2009, interest will be recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and will represent accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%.The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. As originally issued, each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12.422 shares of our common stock (giving effect to the 2 for 1 stock split effective August 26, 2005 and subject to further adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we would have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. On November 19, 2004, the Company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the Company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes, but would change how the conversion value is paid. In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and, at the Companys option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted.Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2009, January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time on or after January 15, 2009 at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the applicable redemption date. As of September 30, 2005, the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on October 1, 2005 based upon the Companys common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on September 30, 2005. In accordance with EITF 04 8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings Per Share, the Company is required to include in its diluted weighted average common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between the Companys average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.80. This is calculated using the treasury stock method. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2007 (dollars in thousands). Payments Due in Fiscal Year Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Long term debt* $ 1,054,986 $ 329,491 $ 725,495 $ $ $ $ Capital leases 3,606 1,612 1,197 657 128 12 Operating leases 108,115 27,426 21,873 16,884 11,989 7,929 22,014 Total $ 1,166,707 $ 358,529 $ 748,565 $ 17,541 $ 12,117 $ 7,941 $ 22,014 *Includes in 2008 $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes which are recorded as a current liability, however, the Company does not expect note holders to exercise their conversion rights within the next 12 months. Amounts Expiring in Fiscal Year Total Amount Committed 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Standby letters of credit and bank guarantees $ 56,318 $ 25,474 $ 28,708 $ 653 $ 18 $ 1,465 $ We have excluded $23 million related to the liability for uncertain tax positions under FIN 48 from the tables as the current portion is not material, and we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long term portion of the liability. See Note 8 to the financial statements. At December 31, 2007, the Company had outstanding surety bonds of $201.6 million. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2008 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 157, "Fair Value Measurements," which clarifies the definition of fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands the disclosures on fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. In February 2008, the FASB issued FSP 157 2 Partial Deferral of the Effective Date of Statement 157 (FSP 157 2). FSP 157 2 delays the effective date of SFAS No. 157, for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at least annually) to fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 157 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS 141(R)). SFAS 141(R) establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures the assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any noncontrolling interest (previously referred to as minority interest) in the acquiree. The provisions of SFAS 141(R) are effective for business combinations occurring on or after January 1, 2009. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 establishes requirements for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the Company (sometimes called minority interests) be clearly identified, presented, and disclosed in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parents equity. All changes in the parents ownership interests are required to be accounted for consistently as equity transactions and any noncontrolling equity investments in deconsolidated subsidiaries must be measured initially at fair value. SFAS No. 160 is effective, on a prospective basis, for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. However, presentation and disclosure requirements must be retrospectively applied to comparative financial statements. The Company is currently assessing the impact of SFAS No. 160 on its consolidated financial position and results of operations. Information About Forward Looking Statements This Annual Report includes and incorporates by reference forward looking statements within the meaning of the federal securities laws. In addition, we, or our executive officers on our behalf, may from time to time make forward looking statements in reports and other documents we file with the SEC or in connection with oral statements made to the press, potential investors or others. All statements that are not historical facts are forward looking statements. The words estimate, project, intend, expect, believe, anticipate, and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. These forward looking statements include statements regarding our expected financial position, business, financing plans, business strategy, business prospects, revenues, working capital, liquidity, capital needs, interest costs and income, in each case relating to our company as a whole, as well as statements regarding acquisitions, potential acquisitions and the benefits of acquisitions. Forward looking statements are estimates and projections reflecting our best judgment and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those suggested by the forward looking statements. These statements are based on our managements beliefs and assumptions, which in turn are based on currently available information. Examples of forward looking statements in this report include but are not limited to our expectations regarding our ability to generate operating cash flows and reduce debt and associated interest expense and our expectations regarding growth through acquisitions. Important assumptions relating to the forward looking statements include, among others, assumptions regarding demand for our products, the cost, timing and success of product upgrades and new product introductions, raw materials costs, expected pricing levels, the timing and cost of expected capital expenditures, expected outcomes of pending litigation, competitive conditions, general economic conditions and expected synergies relating to acquisitions, joint ventures and alliances. These assumptions could prove inaccurate. Although we believe that the estimates and projections reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable, our expectations may prove to be incorrect. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from estimates or projections contained in the forward looking statements include: &middot; difficulty making acquisitions and successfully integrating acquired businesses; &middot; any unforeseen liabilities associated with future acquisitions; &middot; limitations on our business imposed by our indebtedness; &middot; unfavorable changes in foreign exchange rates; &middot; difficulties associated with exports; &middot; risks and costs associated with our international sales and operations; &middot; increased directors and officers liability and other insurance costs; &middot; risk of rising interest rates; &middot; product liability and insurance risks; &middot; increased warranty exposure; &middot; future competition; &middot; the cyclical nature of some of our markets; &middot; reduction of business with large customers; &middot; risks associated with government contracts; &middot; changes in the supply of, or price for, parts and components; &middot; environmental compliance costs and liabilities; &middot; risks and costs associated with asbestos related litigation; &middot; potential write offs of our substantial intangible assets; &middot; our ability to successfully develop new products; &middot; failure to protect our intellectual property; &middot; economic disruptions caused by terrorist attacks, health crises or other unforeseen events; and &middot; the factors discussed in Item 1A to this Annual Report under the heading Risk Factors. We believe these forward looking statements are reasonable. However, you should not place undue reliance on any forward looking statements, which are based on current expectations. Further, forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to publicly update any of them in light of new information or future events. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and we are exposed to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2007, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. Our $1.355 billion senior credit facility contains $955 million in variable rate term loans and a $400 million variable rate revolver. To reduce the financial risk of future rate increases, in 2005 the Company entered into a $250 million fixed rate swap agreement expiring on March 13, 2008. At December 31, 2007, the weighted average interest rate was 5.75% on the variable portion of the term loans and 4.54% on the portion of the term loans covered by the rate swap. Our $230 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.75%. At December 31, 2007, the prevailing market rates were between 1.3% and 2.1% higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. At December 31, 2007, Ropers outstanding variable rate borrowings not covered by the interest rate swap under the $1.355 billion credit facility were $573.7 million. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $5.7 million. Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds, Danish krone or Japanese yen. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 28% of our total sales and 68% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar weakened against most currencies during 2007, which resulted in a 2% sales increase due to foreign currency exchange. The difference between 2007 operating results for these companies translated into U.S. dollars during 2007 and these operating results translated into U.S. dollars during 2006 was approximately 1%. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2007 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately $6.1 million. The changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during 2007 compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2006 resulted in an increase in net assets of $52.3 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $34.8 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. The trading price of Ropers common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock prices also influence the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.
