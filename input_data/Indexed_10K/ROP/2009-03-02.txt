ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in this Annual Report. Overview We are a diversified growth company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, scientific and industrial imaging products and software, industrial technology products and radio frequency products and services. We market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including RF applications, water, energy, research and medical, education, security and other niche markets. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both bolt ons and new strategic platforms. We strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments. On February 20, 2008, we purchased CBORD Holdings Corp. (CBORD), a provider of card systems and integrated security solutions to higher education, healthcare and other markets. On March 20, 2008, we acquired Tech Pro, Inc. (Tech Pro), a manufacturer of physical testing instruments for the rubber and plastic industries. On June 18, 2008, we purchased Chalwyn Limited (Chalwyn), an air shut off valve provider. On July 17, 2008, we purchased the assets, intellectual property and internet domain names of Getloaded.com, LLC (Getloaded), adding new subscribers to our existing freight matching services. On August 27, 2008, we purchased Horizon Software Holdings, Inc. (Horizon), a provider of comprehensive software solutions and related services for the K 12 education market. On September 10, 2008 we purchased Technolog Holdings Limited (Technolog), an end to end solutions provider for network monitoring, pressure management, automatic meter reading and smart metering solutions. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, (GAAP). A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2008 included in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements. Effective January 1, 2006, the Company adopted the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), which requires the Company to recognize expense for the grant date fair value of its employee stock option awards. The Company recognizes the expense of all share based awards on a straight line basis over the employees requisite service period (generally the vesting period of the award). On January 1, 2007 the Company adopted the provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). This Interpretation requires the Company to recognize in the consolidated financial statements only those tax positions determined to be more likely than not of being sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the positions. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuation, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percent of completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite lived asset analyses. These issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated primarily using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns, exchanges, discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2008, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $11.2 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $1.5 million, for a total of $12.7 million, or 3.2% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. The total allowance at December 31, 2008 is $0.8 million higher than at December 31, 2007 and is unchanged as a percent of sales. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. Business trends can change rapidly and these events can affect the evaluation of inventory balances. At December 31, 2008, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $30.1 million, or 13.9% of gross inventory cost, as compared to $28.4 million, or 14.0% of gross inventory cost, at December 31, 2007. The inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of our obsolete inventory. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006. Revenues related to the use of the percentage of completion method of accounting are dependent on a comparison of total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recognized revenue of approximately $127.9 million using this method, primarily for major turn key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects. Approximately $135.5 million and $94.8 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the years ended December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, respectively. At December 31, 2008, approximately $206.8 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage of completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2008, our effective income tax rate was 34.3%, which was lower than the 2007 rate of 34.8%, due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives. Roper accounts for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS 142) requires companies to cease amortizing goodwill that existed at June 30, 2001 and establishes a two step method for testing goodwill for impairment on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value). Total goodwill includes 25 different business components with individual amounts ranging from zero to approximately $502 million. SFAS 142 also requires that an identifiable intangible asset that is determined to have an indefinite useful economic life not be amortized, but separately tested for impairment using a one step fair value based approach. Roper conducts these reviews for all of its reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. No impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2008. Results of Operations The following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated. Dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales. Years ended December 31, Net sales 2008 2007 2006 Industrial Technology $ 687,622 $ 644,436 $ 549,993 Energy Systems and Controls(1) 548,214 516,420 343,699 Scientific and Industrial Imaging(2) 375,542 376,163 338,906 RF Technology(3) 694,993 565,030 468,136 Total $ 2,306,371 $ 2,102,049 $ 1,700,734 Gross profit: Industrial Technology 48.5 % 48.2 % 47.9 % Energy Systems and Controls 53.8 53.6 54.2 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 55.0 54.9 56.8 RF Technology 50.8 46.8 46.8 Total 51.5 50.4 50.6 Operating profit: Industrial Technology 25.9 % 25.6 % 23.4 % Energy Systems and Controls 23.1 24.5 26.3 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 19.9 19.5 21.4 RF Technology 23.0 20.7 17.3 Total 23.4 22.9 21.9 Corporate administrative expenses (2.3 )% (2.0 )% (2.0 )% Income from continuing operations 21.1 20.9 19.9 Interest expense (2.3 ) (2.5 ) (2.6 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt (0.1 ) Other income/(expense) 0.2 (0.1 ) Income from continuing operations before taxes 18.9 18.3 17.3 Income taxes (6.5 ) (6.4 ) (5.9 ) Net earnings 12.4 % 11.9 % 11.4 % (1) Includes results from the acquisitions of Tech Pro from March 20, 2008, Chalwyn from June 18, 2008, DJ Instruments from February 28, 2007, Roda Deaco from March 22, 2007, Dynamic Instruments from June 21, 2007, AC Controls from August 8, 2006 and Dynisco from November 30, 2006. (2) Includes results from the acquisitions of JLT from February 21, 2007, Sinmed from April 5, 2006, and Lumenera from July 25, 2006. (3) Includes results from the acquisitions of CBORD from February 20, 2008, Getloaded from July 17, 2008, Horizon from August 27, 2008, Technolog from September 10, 2008, Black Diamond from September 24, 2007, and Intellitrans from April 26, 2006. Year Ended December 31, 2008 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2007 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $2.31 billion as compared to sales of $2.10 billion for the year ended December 31, 2007, an increase of 9.7%. This increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and internal growth. Our 2008 results included a full year of sales from our 2007 acquisitions of JLT, DJ Instruments, Roda Deaco, Dynamic Instruments and Black Diamond. These results also included ten months of sales from CBORD, nine months from Tech Pro, six months from Chalwyn, five months from Getloaded, four months from Horizon and three months from Technolog. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $133 million of our 2008 net sales increase over 2007 and growth of our other business accounted for $71 million of the increase, or internal growth of 3.4% including a 1% foreign currency exchange impact. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported a $0.6 million or 0.2% decrease in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 over the year ended December 31, 2007. The decrease was attributable to the year over year impact of the removal of the Redlake motion camera product line. Internal growth for 2008 was 0.8% led by increased sales in our medical businesses, partially offset by slowing sales in our industrial camera businesses. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by $31.8 million or 6.2% over the year ended December 31, 2007. Approximately $18 million of the increase was due to full year results from the 2007 acquisitions of DJ Instruments, Roda Deaco, and Dynamic Instruments, as well as partial year results from the 2008 acquisitions of Tech Pro and Chalwyn. Internal growth was approximately $14 million or 2.8%, led by strength in our protective technology and oil and gas pipeline controls businesses. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $43.2 million or 6.7% for the year ended December 31, 2008 over the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase was due to broad based moderate growth in all businesses in this segment. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 increased by $130.0 million or 23.0% over the year ended December 31, 2007. The partial year results from the acquisitions of CBORD, Getloaded, Horizon, and Technolog and full year results of 2007 acquisitions accounted for approximately $119 million of the increase. Internal growth increased 1.9% due to growth in our intelligent traffic systems business, offset by anticipated declines in our large Middle East project as it transitions from the design and installation phase to operations and maintenance. Our overall gross profit percentage was 51.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008, as compared to 50.4% for the year ended December 31, 2007 due to operating leverage on increased sales. Our Industrial Technology, Energy Systems and Controls, and Scientific and Industrial Imaging segments gross margins were relatively unchanged in 2008 as compared to 2007. Our RF Technology segment gross margins increased to 50.8% in 2008 as compared to 46.8% in 2007, due to the favorable mix within existing businesses and higher gross margins at acquired businesses. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased to 30.4% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2008 from 29.5% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007. The increase is primarily due to the higher SG&A structure in our education market businesses within the RF Technology segment. In addition, corporate expenses increased due to higher equity compensation costs and the additional costs to the Company due to the increase in Ropers stock price on the grant dates of stock awards. Interest expense increased $1.5 million, or 2.8%, for the year ended December 31, 2008 compared to the year ended December 31, 2007, primarily due to higher average debt balances throughout 2008, offset by lower interest rates on our variable debt throughout the year. The change in other income for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2007 was primarily due to foreign exchange gains at our non U.S. based companies on U.S. dollar cash, receivables and payables balances as the U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies in the fourth quarter of 2008. These foreign exchange gains were offset by a $3.1 million pre tax debt restructuring charge in the third quarter of 2008 related to the refinancing of our credit facility. During 2008, our effective income tax rate was 34.3% versus 34.8% in 2007. This decrease was due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives. At December 31, 2008, the functional currencies of our European and Canadian subsidiaries were weaker against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2007. The net result of these changes led to a decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $86.7 million in the year ending December 31, 2008. Approximately $59.8 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2008, operating profit increased by less than 1% of sales due to fluctuations in non U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2008 2007 change Industrial Technology $ 656,176 $ 639,348 2.6 % Energy Systems and Controls 541,472 525,899 3.0 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 383,543 377,653 1.6 RF Technology 722,670 575,100 25.7 Total $ 2,303,861 $ 2,118,000 8.8 % The increase in sales orders is due to internal growth of 2.3% with the remainder from acquisitions. The Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year. Net orders in the Energy Systems and Controls segment increased due to the 2007 and 2008 acquisitions. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders increased due to strength in our medical business and camera sales into the security and teleconferencing application markets, offset by decreases in industrial cameras sales. The RF Technology segment experienced strong order growth for projects in the tolling and traffic control businesses. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2008 and 2007 (dollar amounts in thousands). Ropers policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2008 2007 change Industrial Technology $ 59,128 $ 93,076 (36.5 )% Energy Systems and Controls 84,997 93,102 (8.7 ) Scientific and Industrial Imaging 80,020 74,834 6.9 RF Technology 365,669 271,305 34.8 Total $ 589,814 $ 532,317 10.8 % Year Ended December 31, 2007 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2006 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 were $2.10 billion as compared to sales of $1.70 billion for the year ended December 31, 2006, an increase of 23.6%. This increase was the result of sales from acquired companies and strong internal growth. Our 2007 results included a full year of sales from our 2006 acquisitions of Sinmed, Intellitrans, Lumenera, AC Controls, and Dynisco. These results also included ten months of sales from JLT and DJ Instruments, nine months from Roda Deaco, six months from Dynamic Instruments and three months from Black Diamond, all purchased in 2007. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $158 million of our 2007 net sales increase over 2006 and growth of our other business accounted for $243 million of the increase, or internal growth of 14.5% including a 2% foreign currency exchange impact. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment reported an increase in net sales of $37.3 million or 11.0% for the year ended December 31, 2007 over the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was attributable to the full year impact of Sinmed and Lumenera acquired in 2006, and partial year impact of JLT in 2007, which accounted for approximately $23 million of the increase over prior year. Internal growth was 4.2%, which was related to increased sales in the electron microscopy market due to higher demand from OEM customers, offset by weakness in our motion camera product line and decreased sales of handheld computers due to supplier issues encountered during the year. The supplier issues were resolved in 2007 and did not impact operations in 2008. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by $172.7 million or 50.3% over the year ended December 31, 2006. Approximately $127 million of the increase was due to full year results from the 2006 acquisitions of AC Controls and Dynisco, as well as partial year results for DJ Instruments, Roda Deaco, and Dynamic Instruments. Internal growth was approximately $45 million or 14%, primarily from strength in the oil and gas related businesses, which have benefited from the strong global oil and gas market, as well as improved market penetration in our control valve business. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $94.4 million or 17.2% for the year ended December 31, 2007 over the year ended December 31, 2006. The increase was due primarily to high market penetration for our new radio frequency integrated water meter at Neptune Technologies, accounting for 63% of the year over year growth. In addition, sales in our materials testing businesses were up $19 million over the prior year due to increased unit sales. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 increased by $96.9 million or 20.7% over the year ended December 31, 2006. The full year results of Intellitrans, purchased in April, 2006, and four months from the acquisition of Black Diamond on September 24, 2007, accounted for approximately $7 million of the increase. Internal growth increased 19.3% due to strong performance in our traffic and tolling business, which benefited in 2007 from a large Middle East project that continued into 2008. Our overall gross profit percentage was 50.4% for the year ended December 31, 2007, as compared to 50.6% for the year ended December 31, 2006. Industrial Technology gross margins increased to 48.2% as compared to 47.9% in the prior year. Our Energy Systems and Controls segment gross margins decreased to 53.6% in 2007 as compared to 54.2% in 2006, due to the mix change within the segment caused by the inclusion of the lower gross margin Dynisco business. Our Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment gross margins were 54.9% in 2007 as compared to 56.8% in 2006, due primarily to the additional costs related to the DAP touch screen quality issue. Our RF Technology segment gross margins remained constant at 46.8% in both 2007 and 2006. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 29.5% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2007 from 30.8% of net sales for the year ended December 31, 2006. The decrease is due to leverage from higher sales while making a conscious effort to control general and administrative expenses. Interest expense increased $7.4 million, or 16.5%, for the year ended December 31, 2007 compared to the year ended December 31, 2006, primarily due to higher average debt balances throughout 2007 related to the November 30, 2006 acquisition of Dynisco, and additional borrowings throughout the year for the 2007 acquisitions offset by payments on these balances throughout the year. The change in other income for the year ended December 31, 2007 as compared to the year ended December 31, 2006 was primarily due to foreign exchange losses at our non U.S. based companies on U.S. dollar cash, receivables and payables balances as the U.S. dollar weakened against most currencies in 2007. During 2007, our effective income tax rate was 34.8% versus 34.0% in 2006. This increase was due primarily to the expiration of the extraterritorial income inclusion offset somewhat by an increased benefit from our foreign rate differential. At December 31, 2007, the functional currencies of our European and Canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2006. The net result of these changes led to an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $52.3 million in the year period ending December 31, 2007. Approximately $34.8 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2007, operating profit increased by approximately 1% of sales due to fluctuations in non U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net sales order information for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2007 2006 change Industrial Technology $ 639,348 $ 589,322 8.5 % Energy Systems and Controls 525,899 346,880 51.6 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 377,653 341,178 10.7 RF Technology 575,100 511,188 12.5 Total $ 2,118,000 $ 1,788,568 18.4 % The increase in sales orders is due to internal growth of 9.7% with the remainder from acquisitions. The Industrial Technology segment net orders strengthened in most markets over the prior year. Net orders in the Energy Systems and Controls segment increased due to the 2006 and 2007 acquisitions, which accounted for 38.7% of the increase. In addition, there was strong internal growth in our fluid properties testing, non destructive testing and valve and control businesses. Scientific and Industrial Imaging net orders increased from the inclusion of orders from 2006 and 2007 acquisitions, and also from stronger orders in the electron microscopy market, which led to the higher backlog at 2007 in the Scientific and Industrial Imaging segment. The RF Technology segment experienced strong order growth including a significant international project which began in the fourth quarter of 2006 and continued throughout 2007. The following table summarizes sales order backlog information at December 31, 2007 and 2006 (dollar amounts in thousands). Ropers policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2007 2006 change Industrial Technology $ 93,076 $ 95,539 (2.6 )% Energy Systems and Controls 93,102 79,217 17.5 Scientific and Industrial Imaging 74,834 68,600 9.1 RF Technology 271,305 261,243 3.9 Total $ 532,317 $ 504,599 5.5 % Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Net cash provided by operating activities was $434.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, $343.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2007 and $262.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2006. The 2008 increase was primarily due to higher earnings over the prior year and improved receivables collection. Cash used by investing activities during 2008, 2007, and 2006 were primarily business acquisition costs. Cash from financing activities during each of these years was largely debt repayments and borrowings for acquisitions. Financing activities in 2008 included replacing our previous $1.355 billion secured credit facility with our current $1.1 billion unsecured credit facility and the issuance of our $500 million senior notes. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $294.9 million at December 31, 2008 compared to $305.9 million at December 31, 2007. We acquired approximately $7.9 million of net current assets through business acquisitions during 2008. Total debt was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2008 (38.7% of total capital) compared to $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007 (37.2% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2008 compared to December 31, 2007 was due to the replacement of our previous $1.355 billion secured credit facility with our current $1.1 billion unsecured credit facility and the issuance of our $500 million senior notes. Our $1.1 billion credit facility consists of a two year $350 million term loan and a five year $750 million revolving loan. The weighted average interest rate on the borrowings under the facility at December 31, 2008 was 1.90%. At December 31, 2008, our debt consisted of $230 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2034, $500 million in senior notes due 2013, the $350 million term loan due 2010 and $179 million on the revolving loan. In addition, we had $8.5 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in various foreign locations to support our non U.S. businesses. The Company had $51.1 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2008, of which $47.3 million were covered by our lending group, thereby reducing its remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately. We expect that our available borrowing capacity, combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses, will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2008. Capital expenditures of $30.0 million, $30.1 million and $32.2 million were incurred during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In the future, we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be less than 2% of annual sales. Description of Certain Indebtedness Senior Unsecured Credit Facility On July 7, 2008, the Company entered into a new $1.1 billion unsecured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders, which replaces its $1.355 billion amended and restated secured credit facility, dated as of December 13, 2004. The $1.1 billion facility is composed of a $350 million term loan facility maturing July 7, 2010 and a five year $750 million revolving credit facility maturing July 7, 2013. The Company may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $350 million. The facility contains various affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 3.5. Senior Notes On August 6, 2008, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior notes due August 15, 2013 (the Notes). The Notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.625% per year, payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning February 15, 2009. The interest payable on the Notes is subject to adjustment if either Moodys Investors Service or Standard & Poors Ratings Services downgrades the rating assigned to the Notes. We may redeem some or all of the Notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount plus a make whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities as described in the indenture relating to the Notes. The Notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Companys existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The Notes are effectively subordinated to any of the Companys existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The Notes are not guaranteed by any of the Companys subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Companys subsidiaries. Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes In December 2003, we issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%, resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes is payable semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009. After that date, we will not pay cash interest on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable. Instead, after January 15, 2009, interest will be recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and will represent accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. As originally issued, each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12.422 shares of our common stock (giving effect to the 2 for 1 stock split effective August 26, 2005 and subject to further adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we would have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. On November 19, 2004, the Company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the Company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes, but would change how the conversion value is paid. In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and, at the Companys option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2009, January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time on or after January 15, 2009 at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the applicable redemption date. As of September 30, 2005, the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on October 1, 2005 based upon the Companys common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on September 30, 2005. In accordance with EITF 04 8, The Effect of Contingently Convertible Debt on Diluted Earnings Per Share, the Company is required to include in its diluted weighted average common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between the Companys average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.80. This is calculated using the treasury stock method. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2008 (dollars in thousands). Contractual Cash Obligations Total Payments Due in Fiscal Year 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Long term debt $ 1,260,668 $ 231,668 $ 350,000 $ $ $ 679,000 $ Senior Note interest 169,306 34,598 33,585 33,585 33,677 33,861 Capital leases 6,848 2,159 1,847 1,023 523 340 956 Operating leases 99,862 27,635 21,003 13,726 10,374 8,036 19,088 Total $ 1,536,684 $ 296,060 $ 406,435 $ 48,334 $ 44,574 $ 721,237 $ 20,044 Other Commercial Commitments Total Amount Committed Amounts Expiring in Fiscal Year 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Standby letters of credit and bank guarantees $ 51,082 $ 47,670 $ 1,262 $ 319 $ 85 $ 1,746 $ We have excluded $26 million related to the liability for uncertain tax positions under FIN 48 from the tables as the current portion is not material, and we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long term portion of the liability. See Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. At December 31, 2008, the Company had outstanding surety bonds of $239 million. At December 31, 2008 and 2007, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our various credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and further acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any further acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2009 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2008, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. Our $1.1 billion senior credit facility contains $350 million in variable rate term loans and a $750 million variable rate revolver. At December 31, 2008, the weighted average interest rate was 1.90% on the variable portion of the term loans and revolver. Our $500 million senior notes have a fixed interest rate of 6.625%, and our $230 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.75%. At December 31, 2008, the prevailing market rates for long term notes were between 1.8% and 4.7% higher than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. At December 31, 2008, Ropers outstanding variable rate borrowings under the $1.1 billion credit facility were $529 million. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $5.3 million. Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds, Danish krone or Japanese yen. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 24% of our total sales and 71% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar weakened against most currencies during the first three quarters of 2008 and then strengthened significantly in the fourth quarter of 2008, which resulted in a 1% sales increase due to foreign currency exchange. The difference between 2008 operating income for these companies translated into U.S. dollars during 2008 and operating income translated into U.S. dollars during 2007 was less than 1%. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2008 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our expected net earnings would have been approximately 3.5%. The changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during 2008 compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2007 resulted in a decrease in net assets of $86.7 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $59.8 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. The trading price of Ropers common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees perceptions of various programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.
