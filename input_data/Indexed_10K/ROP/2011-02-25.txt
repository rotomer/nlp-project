ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes included in this Annual Report. Overview We are a diversified growth company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, medical and scientific imaging products and software, industrial technology products and radio frequency products and services. We market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including RF applications, medical, water, energy, research, education, food and food services, security and other niche markets. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both bolt ons and new strategic platforms. We strive for high cash and earnings returns from our acquisition investments. On February 22, 2010, we purchased the assets of Heartscape, Inc., including a technology with the capability to improve the speed and accuracy of detecting heart attacks. On July 27, 2010, we purchased iTradeNetwork, Inc., (iTrade) a global provider of software asa service (SaaS) based trading network and business intelligence solutions primarily to the perishable food market. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, (GAAP). A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2010 included in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuation, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percentage of completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite lived asset analyses. These issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that current and near term forecast economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns, exchanges, discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine l ikely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2010, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $7.9 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $2.4 million, for a total of $10.3 million, or 2.6% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. The total allowance at December 31, 2010 was $0.8 million lower than at December 31, 2009. The allowance will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on specific identification of allowances needed due to changes in our business as well as the write off of uncollectible receivables. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. At December 31, 2010, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $32.5 million, or 15.4% of gross inventory cost, as compared to $29.0 million, or 14.0% of gross inventory cost, at December 31, 2009. The inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical dispo sal of obsolete inventory. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. Revenues related to the use of the percentage of completion method of accounting are dependent on total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized revenue of approximately $131.0 million using this method, primarily for major turn key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects. Approximately $142.5 million and $127.9 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the years ended December 31, 2009 and December 31, 2008, respectively. At December 31, 2010, approximately $157.7 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage of completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the United States, combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2010, our effective income tax rate was 28.1%, which was lower than the 2009 rate of 29.5% due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives and an increase in the Section 199 qualifying production activities deduction. We account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment using a two step method on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value). Total goodwill includes 25 different business components with individual amounts ranging from zero to approximately $536 million. Identifiable intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment on an annual basis using a one step fair value based approach. We conduct these reviews for all of our reporting units during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year. No impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2010. Results of Operations The following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated. Dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales. Years ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 Net sales Industrial Technology $ 607,564 $ 536,219 $ 687,622 Energy Systems and Controls(1) 503,897 440,919 548,214 Medical and Scientific Imaging(2) 548,718 354,776 375,542 RF Technology(3) 725,933 717,754 694,993 Total $ 2,386,112 $ 2,049,668 $ 2,306,371 Gross profit: Industrial Technology 51.0 % 47.6 % 48.5 % Energy Systems and Controls 53.7 53.1 53.8 Medical and Scientific Imaging 61.3 56.5 55.0 RF Technology 49.4 49.3 50.8 Total 53.4 50.9 51.5 Operating profit: Industrial Technology 26.7 % 23.1 % 25.9 % Energy Systems and Controls 23.9 21.0 23.1 Medical and Scientific Imaging 23.8 20.9 19.9 RF Technology 20.8 21.5 23.0 Total 23.6 21.7 23.4 Corporate administrative expenses (2.1 )% (2.4 )% (2.3 )% Income from continuing operations 21.6 19.3 21.1 Interest expense (2.8 ) (2.9 ) (2.6 ) Loss on extinguishment of debt (0.1 ) Other income/(expense) 0.2 0.2 Income from continuing operations before taxes 18.8 16.6 18.6 Income taxes (5.3 ) (4.9 ) (6.4 ) Net earnings 13.5 % 11.7 % 12.2 % (1) Includes results from the acquisitions of Tech Pro from March 20, 2008, and Chalwyn from June 18, 2008. (2) Includes results from the acquisition of Verathon from December 3, 2009. (3) Includes results from the acquisitions of CBORD from February 20, 2008, Getloaded from July 17, 2008, Horizon from August 27, 2008, Technolog from September 10, 2008, UTS from October 30, 2009 and iTrade from July 27, 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $2.39 billion as compared to sales of $2.05 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of 16.4%. The increase was the result of internal sales growth of 7.8% as well as a full year of sales from our 2009 acquisitions of UTS and Verathon and five months of sales from iTrade. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $179 million of additional sales in 2010 over 2009. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment reported a $193.9 million or 54.7% increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 over the year ended December 31, 2009. Acquisitions added $147.9 million in sales, while organic sales increased 12.5% due to broad based increases in medical, imaging and handheld computer markets. The impact from foreign exchange was a positive 1.0%, resulting in internal growth of 13.5%. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $63.0 million or 14.3% over the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in sales was due to broad based recovery in the markets served by the segment which led to increased demand for our instruments, valves and sensors sold into these markets. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $71.3 million or 13.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010 over the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was due to a broad based economic recovery in the industrial end markets, strong sales growth in our Neptune water meter business and increased sales in our materials testing businesses as customer manufacturing facilities which had experienced slowdowns or temporary shutdowns in 2009 came back on line or increased production. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $8.2 million or 1.1% over the year ended December 31, 2009. Internal sales decreased 3.2% due to delays in transportation projects due to temporary reductions in state and local governmental funding. Partial year results from the acquisition of iTrade and full year results of UTS added 4.3%. In 2009, in order to mitigate the effects of the weakened global economy on our financial results, we committed to certain severance and related cost control actions. The cost of these actions during the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $12.4 million, $4.1 million of which was recorded as cost of goods sold and the remaining $8.3 million as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense. As of December 31, 2010, $12.0 million in cash payments had been made, with the remaining $0.4 million reported as accrued liabilities, which are expected to be paid in 2011. We had no additional material severance and related cost control actions in 2010. Our overall gross profit percentage was 53.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to 50.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our Industrial Technology and Energy Systems and Controls segments both experienced higher gross margins due to higher sales volume while maintaining a relatively flat cost structure. Medical and Scientific Imaging segment gross margins increased primarily due to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin. Our RF Technology segment gross margins were relatively unchanged. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $113.1 million to $760.8 million in 2010 as compared to $647.7 million in 2009, while increasing as a percentage of net sales to 31.9% for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 31.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The full year inclusion of Verathon accounted for $72 million of the increase. In addition, our research and development spending increased $19 million as we continued to invest in new product development. Interest expense increased $8.0 million, or 13.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase is due primarily to higher interest rates in the current year, which accounted for approximately $5 million of the increase, and a higher average debt balance throughout 2010. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $0.6 million, which was primarily due to gain on sale of assets offset by foreign exchange losses. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $3.5 million, primarily due to a pre tax gain of $4.1 million related to the sale of certain assets of our satellite communications business, partially offset by a $0.4 million pre tax debt extinguishment charge for the early repayment of our term loan and foreign exchange losses at our non U.S. based companies. During 2010, our effective income tax rate was 28.1% versus 29.5% in 2009. This decrease was due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives and an increase in the Section 199 qualifying production activities deduction. At December 31, 2010, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were weaker, and the Canadian dollar stronger, against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2009. The net result of these changes led to a decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $19.8 million in the year ending December 31, 2010. Approximately $15.5 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2010, operating profit decreased by less than 0.5% due to fluctuations in non U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2010 2009 change Industrial Technology $ 669,882 $ 528,208 26.8 % Energy Systems and Controls 538,861 427,003 26.2 Medical and Scientific Imaging 578,957 349,132 65.8 RF Technology 748,536 719,666 4.0 Total $ 2,536,236 $ 2,024,009 25.3 % The increase in orders was due to internal growth of 15.8%, as well as orders from acquisitions which added $195 million. Our Industrial Technology and Energy Systems and Controls segments experienced strong internal growth throughout 2010, as did our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment which also experienced an increase of $159 million due to 2009 acquisitions. In our RF Technology segment, internal orders decreased by 1.1%, which was more than offset by acquisition growth. The following table summarizes order backlog information at December 31, 2010 and 2009 (dollar amounts in thousands). Our policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2010 2009 change Industrial Technology $ 113,981 $ 52,079 118.9 % Energy Systems and Controls 104,466 70,901 47.3 Medical and Scientific Imaging 103,769 73,747 40.7 RF Technology 463,115 368,762 25.6 Total $ 785,358 $ 565,489 38.9 % Year Ended December 31, 2009 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2008 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 were $2.05 billion as compared to sales of $2.31 billion for the year ended December 31, 2008, a decrease of 11.1%. This decrease was the result of the worldwide economic slump experienced throughout 2009. Our 2009 results included a full year of sales from our 2008 acquisitions of CBORD, Tech Pro, Chalwyn, Getloaded, Horizon and Technolog. These results also included two months from UTS and one month from Verathon. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $79 million of additional sales in 2009 over 2008 that was offset by a decrease in sales of our other business of $335 million, or 15%, which includes negative organic growth of 14% and a 1% negative foreign exchange impact. In order to mitigate the effects of the weakened global economy on our financial results, we committed to certain severance and related cost control actions during the year ended December 31, 2009. The cost of these actions totaled $12.4 million, $4.1 million of which was recorded as cost of goods sold and the remaining $8.3 million as selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense. As of December 31, 2010, $12.0 million in cash payments had been made, with the remaining $0.4 million reported as accrued liabilities, which are expected to be paid in 2011. We had no additional material severance and related cost control actions in 2010. The impact of these costs on our business segment results is included below. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment reported a $20.8 million or 5.5% decrease in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 over the year ended December 31, 2008. Organic sales decreased 7.3% due to lower shipments to research and imaging markets and the impact from foreign exchange was negative 1.6%. These declines were slightly offset by one month of sales from Verathon. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 decreased by $107.3 million or 19.6% over the year ended December 31, 2008. We experienced negative internal growth of approximately $108.5 million or 19.9%, which includes a 2.2% negative foreign exchange impact. The decrease in sales was due to broad based weakness in the markets serviced by the segment which led to reduced demand for our instruments, valves and sensors sold into these markets. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment decreased by $151.4 million or 22.0% for the year ended December 31, 2009 over the year ended December 31, 2008. The decrease was due to a generally weak economy, fewer projects for automatic meter reading deployment at Neptune and the slowdown or temporary shutdowns of many customer manufacturing facilities which impacted our materials testing business. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2009 increased by $22.8 million or 3.3% over the year ended December 31, 2008. Internal sales decreased 6.2% due to weakness in security markets and lower hardware and tag sales related to transportation projects. Partial year results from the acquisition of UTS and full year results of 2008 acquisitions added 9.3%. Our overall gross profit percentage was 50.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009, as compared to 51.5% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The $4.1 million in restructuring charges included in cost of goods sold represented 0.2% as a percentage of net sales in 2009, as our restructuring and other cost containment actions at the business unit level nearly offset the negative operating leverage on decreased sales. Our Industrial Technology and Energy Systems and Controls segments both experienced lower gross margins due to the decline in sales as a result of weakness in their end markets. Medical and Scientific Imaging segment gross margins increased primarily due to favorable product mix, lower costs and favorable leverage due to a record fourth quarter sales performance. Our RF Technology segment gross margins were negat ively impacted by an unfavorable product mix due to higher service revenue and lower hardware shipments in transportation end markets. Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $54.4 million to $647.7 million in 2009 as compared to $702.1 million in 2008, while increasing as a percentage of net sales to 31.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009 as compared to 30.4% for the year ended December 31, 2008. The change is primarily due to negative operating leverage on lower sales. Included in the 2009 expense were restructuring costs of $8.3 million. Interest expense decreased $2.3 million, or 3.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 compared to the year ended December 31, 2008, primarily due to the inclusion in 2008 of amortization of the debt discount on our convertible notes, which ceased on January 15, 2009. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $2.9 million, which was primarily due to a pre tax gain of $4.1 million related to the sale of certain assets of our satellite communications business, partially offset by a $0.4 million pre tax debt extinguishment charge for the early repayment of our term loan and foreign exchange losses at our non U.S. based companies. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2008 was $3.5 million, primarily due to foreign exchange gains at our non U.S. based companies, offset by a $3.1 million pre tax debt extinguishment charge in the third quarter of 2008 related to the refinancing of our credit facility. During 2009, our effective income tax rate was 29.5% versus 34.3% in 2008. This decrease was due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives, our decision to permanently reinvest prior earnings in certain foreign jurisdictions, the release of reserves related to uncertain tax provisions and an approximately $1.8 million discrete benefit related to the resolution of a tax item in a foreign jurisdiction. At December 31, 2009, the functional currencies of our European and Canadian subsidiaries were stronger against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2008. The net result of these changes led to an increase in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $42.4 million in the year ending December 31, 2009. Approximately $28.2 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2009, operating profit decreased by approximately 1% due to fluctuations in non U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2009 2008 change Industrial Technology $ 528,208 $ 656,176 (19.5 )% Energy Systems and Controls 427,003 541,472 (21.1 ) Medical and Scientific Imaging 349,132 383,543 (9.0 ) RF Technology 719,666 722,670 (0.4 ) Total $ 2,024,009 $ 2,303,861 (12.1 )% The decrease in orders is due to overwhelming weaknesses in world markets, however, order backlog as of December 31, 2009, only decreased by 4.1% as compared to December 31, 2008. This was due primarily to a fourth quarter order increase in our Medical and Scientific Imaging and RF Technology segments. The following table summarizes order backlog information at December 31, 2009 and 2008 (dollar amounts in thousands). Our policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2009 2008 change Industrial Technology $ 52,079 $ 59,128 (11.9 )% Energy Systems and Controls 70,901 84,997 (16.6 ) Medical and Scientific Imaging 73,747 80,020 (7.8 ) RF Technology 368,762 365,669 0.8 Total $ 565,489 $ 589,814 (4.1 )% Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008 are as follows (in millions): 2010 2009 2008 Cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 499.5 $ 367.5 $ 434.4 Investing activities (563.3 ) (374.2 ) (739.3 ) Financing activities 167.6 (13.6 ) 187.9 Operating activities The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2010 was primarily due to higher earnings over the prior year, increased compensation related accruals related to higher income levels in 2010 and increased intangible amortization related to recent acquisitions. Investing activities Cash used by investing activities during 2010, 2009, and 2008 were primarily business acquisitions. Financing activities Cash provided by financing activities during each of these years was primarily debt borrowings for acquisitions partially offset by debt payments made using cash from operations and in 2009 also included $121 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of issuance costs. Cash used by financing activities in all periods was primarily debt repayments. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $281.4 million at December 31, 2010 compared to $337.8 million at December 31, 2009. We acquired negative net working capital of $5.9 million through business acquisitions during 2010. Total debt was $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010 (32.8% of total capital) compared to $1.2 billion at December 31, 2009 (32.3% of total capital). Our increased debt at December 31, 2010 compared to December 31, 2009 was due to borrowings for 2010 acquisitions, partially offset by debt payments made using cash from operations. Our senior unsecured credit facility originally consisted of a two year $350 million term loan and a five year $750 million revolving loan; however, the term loan portion was repaid in September 2009 and cannot be reborrowed. The weighted average interest rate on the revolver borrowings under the facility at December 31, 2010 was 1.56%. At December 31, 2010, our debt consisted of $91 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due in 2034, $500 million of senior notes due 2013, $500 million of senior notes due 2019, and $230 million outstanding under the revolving loan. In addition, we had $6.0 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our non U.S. businesses. The Company had $55.3 mill ion of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2010, of which $51.9 million were covered by our lending group, thereby reducing its remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately. We expect that our available borrowing capacity, combined with existing cash balances and cash flows expected to be generated from existing businesses, will be sufficient to fund normal operating requirements and finance additional acquisitions. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2010. Capital expenditures of $28.6 million, $25.9 million and $30.0 million were incurred during 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. In the future, we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be between 1.0% and 1.5% of annual net sales. Description of Certain Indebtedness Senior Unsecured Credit Facility On July 7, 2008, the Company entered into a senior unsecured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is composed of a five year $750 million revolving credit facility maturing July 7, 2013 and, as originally issued, a $350 million term loan facility originally maturing July 7, 2010. The $350 million term loan was repaid early in September 2009. The Company may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $350 million. The credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 3.5. Senior Notes due 2019 In September 2009, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes due September 2019. Net proceeds of $496 million were used to pay off our $350 million term loan originally due July 2010 and the outstanding revolver balance under our credit facility. We recorded a $0.4 million non cash debt extinguishment charge related to the early repayment of the term loan portion of the facility. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.25% per year, payable semi annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning March 1, 2010. We may redeem some of all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities. The notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. Senior Notes due 2013 On August 6, 2008, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior notes due August 15, 2013. These notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.625% per year, payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning February 15, 2009. The interest payable on the notes is subject to adjustment if either Moodys Investors Service or Standard & Poors Ratings Services downgrades the rating assigned to the notes. We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount plus a make whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities as described in the indenture relating to the notes. The notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Companys existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated to any of the Companys existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes are not guaranteed by any of the Companys subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of the Companys subsidiaries. During 2009 we entered into an aggregate notional amount of $500 million in interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges , which effectively changed our $500 million senior notes due 2013 with a fixed interest rate of 6.625% to a variable rate obligation at a weighted average spread of 4.377% plus the three month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Due to the application of fair value hedge accounting for the swaps, the notes are shown in the balance sheet net of a $14.1 million fair value adjustment at December 31, 2010 and $(3.2) million at December 31, 2009. Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes In December 2003, we issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%, resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes was payable semiannually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009, after which cash interest will not be paid on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable. Since January 15, 2009, interest is recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and represents accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%. In accordance with this criterion, contingent interest has been paid for each six month period since January 15, 2009. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. As originally issued, each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12.422 shares of our common stock (giving effect to the 2 for 1 stock split effective August 26, 2005 and subject to further adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we would have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. On November 19, 2004, the Company began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that the Company would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes, but would change how the conversion value is paid. In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and, at the Companys option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted. As of September 30, 2005, the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on October 1, 2005 based upon the Companys common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on September 30, 2005. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the applicable redemption date. The Company includes in its diluted weighted average common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between the Companys average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.80, plus accretion. This is calculated using the treasury stock method. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2010 (in thousands).

We have excluded $29 million related to the liability for uncertain tax positions from the tables as the current portion is not material, and we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long term portion of the liability. See Note 8 of the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2. We have excluded interest on the Senior notes due 2013, as they have been effectively converted to variable rate debt due to interest rate swaps. See Description of Certain Indebtedness above. At December 31, 2010, we had outstanding surety bonds of $317 million. At December 31, 2010 and 2009, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2011 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 1 of our notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2010, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. Our credit facility contains a $750 million variable rate revolver. At December 31, 2010, the weighted average interest rate was 1.56% on the outstanding revolver balance of $230 million. Our $500 million senior notes due 2019 have a fixed interest rate of 6.25%, and our $91 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.75%. Our $500 million senior notes due 2013 have a fixed interest rate of 6.625%; however, in October 2009 we entered into three interest rate swap agreements totaling $500 million that expire August 2013. The swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, effectively convert the notes to a weighted average variable rate obligation with a spread of 4.377% plus LIBOR. At Decem ber 31, 2010, the prevailing market rates for our long term notes were between 1.5% and 4.1% lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. At December 31, 2010, our outstanding variable rate borrowings were $230 million in revolver borrowings and the $500 million senior notes due 2013. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $7.3 million. Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds or Danish krone. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 25% of our total sales and 64% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar strengthened against most currencies and weakened against the Canadian dollar throughout 2010, which resulted in an increase in sales of less than 1% due to foreign currency exchange. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2010 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 3.2%. The changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar during 2010 compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2009 resulted in a decrease in net assets of $19.8 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $15.5 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. The trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees perceptions of programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.
