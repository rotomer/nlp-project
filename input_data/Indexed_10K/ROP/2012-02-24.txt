ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with Selected Financial Data and our Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes included in this Annual Report. Overview We are a diversified growth company that designs, manufactures and distributes energy systems and controls, medical and scientific imaging products and software, industrial technology products and radio frequency products and services. We market these products and services to selected segments of a broad range of markets including RF applications, medical, water, energy, research, education, software as a service ("SaaS") based information networks, security and other niche markets. We pursue consistent and sustainable growth in earnings and cash flow by emphasizing continuous improvement in the operating performance of our existing businesses and by acquiring other carefully selected businesses. Our acquisitions have represented both bolt ons and new strategic platforms. On June 3, 2011, we purchased the assets of NDI Holding Corp. (Northern Digital), a provider of 3 D measurement technology for medical applications in computer assisted surgery and computer assisted therapy. On September 26, 2011, we purchased the shares of United Controls Group, Inc. (UCG), a manufacturer of control systems in the oil and gas industry. On December 1, 2011, we purchased the shares of Trinity Integrated Systems Ltd. (Trinity), a specialist provider of requirements capture, safety lifecycle management and engineering software tools, and safety and control system solutions to the oil and gas, industrial process and control markets. Application of Critical Accounting Policies Our Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP). A discussion of our significant accounting policies can also be found in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for the year ended December 31, 2011 included in this Annual Report. GAAP offers acceptable alternative methods for accounting for certain issues affecting our financial results, such as determining inventory cost, depreciating long lived assets and recognizing revenue. We have not changed the application of acceptable accounting methods or the significant estimates affecting the application of these principles in the last three years in a manner that had a material effect on our financial statements. The preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP requires the use of estimates, assumptions, judgments and interpretations that can affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and other supplemental disclosures. The development of accounting estimates is the responsibility of our management. Our management discusses those areas that require significant judgments with the audit committee of our Board of Directors. The audit committee has reviewed all financial disclosures in our annual filings with the SEC. Although we believe the positions we have taken with regard to uncertainties are reasonable, others might reach different conclusions and our positions can change over time as more information becomes available. If an accounting estimate changes, its effects are accounted for prospectively or through a cumulative catch up adjustment. Our most significant accounting uncertainties are encountered in the areas of accounts receivable collectibility, inventory valuation, future warranty obligations, revenue recognition (percentage of completion), income taxes and goodwill and indefinite lived asset analyses. These issues, except for income taxes, which are not allocated to our business segments, affect each of our business segments. These issues are evaluated using a combination of historical experience, current conditions and relatively short term forecasting. Accounts receivable collectibility is based on the economic circumstances of customers and credits given to customers after shipment of products, including in certain cases credits for returned products. Accounts receivable are regularly reviewed to determine customers who have not paid within agreed upon terms, whether these amounts are consistent with past experiences, what historical experience has been with amounts deemed uncollectible and the impact that economic conditions might have on collection efforts in general and with specific customers. The returns and other sales credit allowance is an estimate of customer returns, exchanges, discounts or other forms of anticipated concessions and is treated as a reduction in revenue. The returns and other sales credits histories are analyzed to determine likely future rates for such credits. At December 31, 2011, our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was $8.2 million and our allowance for sales returns and sales credits was $2.4 million, for a total of $10.6 million, or 2.4% of total gross accounts receivable. This percentage is influenced by the risk profile of the underlying receivables, and the timing of write offs of accounts deemed uncollectible. The total allowance at December 31, 2011 was $0.3 million higher than at December 31, 2010. The allowance will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of sales based on specific identification of allowances needed due to changes in our business as well as the write off of uncollectible receivables. We regularly compare inventory quantities on hand against anticipated future usage, which we determine as a function of historical usage or forecasts related to specific items in order to evaluate obsolescence and excessive quantities. When we use historical usage, this information is also qualitatively compared to business trends to evaluate the reasonableness of using historical information as an estimate of future usage. At December 31, 2011, inventory reserves for excess and obsolete inventory were $35.2 million, or 14.7% of gross inventory cost, as compared to $32.5 million, or 15.4% of gross inventory cost, at December 31, 2010. The inventory reserve as a percent of gross inventory cost will continue to fluctuate based upon specific identification of reserves needed based upon changes in our business as well as the physical disposal of obsolete inventory. Most of our sales are covered by warranty provisions that generally provide for the repair or replacement of qualifying defective items for a specified period after the time of sale, typically 12 months. Future warranty obligations are evaluated using, among other factors, historical cost experience, product evolution and customer feedback. Our expense for warranty obligations was less than 1% of net sales for each of the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. Revenues related to the use of the percentage of completion method of accounting are dependent on total costs incurred compared with total estimated costs for a project. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we recognized revenue of approximately $151.5 million using this method, primarily for major turn key, longer term toll and traffic and energy projects. Approximately $131.0 million and $142.5 million of revenue was recognized using this method during the years ended December 31, 2010 and December 31, 2009, respectively. At December 31, 2011, $132.1 million of revenue related to unfinished percentage of completion contracts had yet to be recognized. Contracts accounted for under this method are generally not significantly different in profitability from revenues accounted for under other methods. Income taxes can be affected by estimates of whether and within which jurisdictions future earnings will occur and if, how and when cash is repatriated to the U.S., combined with other aspects of an overall income tax strategy. Additionally, taxing jurisdictions could retroactively disagree with our tax treatment of certain items, and some historical transactions have income tax effects going forward. Accounting rules require these future effects to be evaluated using current laws, rules and regulations, each of which can change at any time and in an unpredictable manner. During 2011, our effective income tax rate was 29.4%, which was higher than the 2010 rate of 28.1% due primarily to a foreign tax credit received in 2010 which did not recur in 2011. We account for goodwill in a purchase business combination as the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets acquired. Business combinations can also result in other intangible assets being recognized. Amortization of intangible assets, if applicable, occurs over their estimated useful lives. Goodwill, which is not amortized, is tested for impairment on an annual basis (or an interim basis if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value) using a two step process. The first step of the process utilizes both an income approach (discounted cash flows) and a market approach consisting of a comparable public company earnings multiples methodology to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit. To determine the reasonableness of the estimated fair values, we review the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach provides significantly different valuations. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, no further work is required and no impairment loss is recognized. If the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, the goodwill of the reporting unit is potentially impaired and then the second step would be completed in order to measure the impairment loss by calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets (including unrecognized intangible assets) of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying value of goodwill, an impairment loss would be recognized. Key assumptions used in the income and market methodologies are updated when the analysis is performed for each reporting unit. Various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted average cost of capital, comparable transactions, market data and earnings multiples. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the anticipated future cash flows, discount rates, and the earnings multiples. While we use reasonable and timely information to prepare our cash flow and discount rate assumptions, actual future cash flows or market conditions could differ significantly resulting in future impairment charges related to recorded goodwill balances. Total goodwill includes 26 reporting units with individual amounts ranging from zero to $536 million. We concluded that the fair value of each of our reporting units was substantially in excess of its carrying value as of December 31, 2011, and thus no goodwill impairment was identified. Identifiable intangible assets that are determined to have an indefinite useful economic life are not amortized, but separately tested for impairment annually using a one step fair value based approach. Roper conducts these reviews for all of its reporting units and indefinite lived intangibles during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year or on an interim basis if an event occurs that it is more likely than not the fair value of the intangible asset is below its carrying value. No impairment resulted from the annual reviews performed in 2011. Roper evaluates whether there has been an impairment of identifiable intangible assets with definite useful economic lives, or of the remaining life of such assets, when certain indicators of impairment are present. In the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost or remaining period of amortization of any asset may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability would be performed. If an evaluation is required, the estimated future gross, undiscounted cash flows associated with the asset would be compared to the assets carrying amount to determine if a write down to fair value or a revision in the remaining amortization period is required. Results of Operations The following table sets forth selected information for the years indicated. Dollar amounts are in thousands and percentages are of net sales. Amounts may not foot due to rounding. Years ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Net sales Industrial Technology $ 737,356 $ 607,564 $ 536,219 Energy Systems and Controls(1) 597,802 503,897 440,919 Medical and Scientific Imaging(2) 610,617 548,718 354,776 RF Technology(3) 851,314 725,933 717,754 Total $ 2,797,089 $ 2,386,112 $ 2,049,668 Gross profit: Industrial Technology 49.8 % 51.0 % 47.6 % Energy Systems and Controls 55.5 53.7 53.1 Medical and Scientific Imaging 63.3 61.3 56.5 RF Technology 50.6 49.4 49.3 Total 54.2 53.4 50.9 Operating profit: Industrial Technology 28.2 % 26.7 % 23.1 % Energy Systems and Controls 26.4 23.9 21.0 Medical and Scientific Imaging 24.3 23.8 20.9 RF Technology 23.8 20.8 21.5 Total 25.6 23.6 21.7 Corporate administrative expenses (2.0 )% (2.1 )% (2.4 )% Income from continuing operations 23.6 21.6 19.3 Interest expense, net (2.3 ) (2.8 ) (2.9 ) Other income/(expense) 0.3 0.2 Income from continuing operations before taxes 21.6 18.8 16.6 Income taxes (6.4 ) (5.3 ) (4.9 ) Net earnings 15.3 % 13.5 % 11.7 % (1) Includes results from the acquisitions of UCG from September 26, 2011 and Trinity from December 1, 2011. (1) Includes results from the acquisitions of Verathon from December 3, 2009, Heartscape from February 22, 2010 and Northern Digital from June 3, 2011. (3) Includes results from the acquisitions of UTS from October 30, 2009 and iTrade from July 27, 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2011 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2010 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 were $2.78 billion as compared to sales of $2.39 billion for the year ended December 31, 2010, an increase of 17.2%. The increase was the result of organic sales growth of 12.7%, favorable effect from foreign exchange of 1.4% and 3.1% from acquisitions. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment reported a $61.9 million or 11.3% increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 over the year ended December 31, 2010. Acquisitions added $26.1 million in sales, while organic sales increased 5.1% due to increased sales in our electron microscopy and medical businesses. The impact from foreign exchange was a positive 1.4%. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $93.9 million or 18.6% over the year ended December 31, 2010. Organic sales increased 15.9% while acquisitions added $4 million, or 0.8%. The increase in organic sales was primarily due to increased demand in industrial process end markets and growth in our diesel engine safety systems. The impact from foreign exchange was a positive 2.0%. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $129.8 million or 21.4% for the year ended December 31, 2011 over the year ended December 31, 2010. The increase was due to broad based growth in all businesses in the segment, with particular strength in our materials testing business and fluid handling businesses, as well as a positive 1.8% impact from foreign exchange. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased by $125.4 million or 17.3% over the year ended December 31, 2010. Organic sales increased 10.3% due to strength in sales to colleges and universities, growth in our water and gas network monitoring products and growth in our toll and traffic solutions. Foreign exchange added 0.7% to revenue and acquisitions added 6.3%. Our overall gross profit percentage was 54.2% for the year ended December 31, 2011, as compared to 53.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010. Our Energy Systems and Controls and RF Technology segments both experienced higher gross margins due to higher sales volume while maintaining a relatively flat cost structure. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment gross margins increased primarily due to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin. Our Industrial Technology segment gross margins decreased slightly due to product mix. Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expenses increased $94.2 million to $855.0 million in 2011 as compared to $760.8 million in 2010, while decreasing as a percentage of net sales to 30.6% for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to 31.9% for the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease in percentage of net sales is due to operating leverage on higher sales volume, offset in part by increased research and development spending of $19 million as we continued to invest in new product development. Interest expense decreased $2.9 million, or 4.3%, for the year ended December 31, 2011 compared to the year ended December 31, 2010. The decrease is due primarily to lower average debt balances and higher interest income throughout 2011. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $8.1 million, which was primarily due to a currency remeasurement gain on an intercompany note. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $0.6 million, primarily due to gain on sale of assets offset by foreign exchange losses at our non U.S. based companies. During 2011, our effective income tax rate was 29.4% versus 28.1% in 2010. This increase was due primarily to a foreign tax credit received in 2010 which did not recur in 2011. At December 31, 2011, the functional currencies of our Canadian and most of our European subsidiaries were weaker against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2010. The net result of these changes led to a decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $11.0 million in the year ending December 31, 2011. Approximately $5.1 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2011, operating profit increased by 1.4% due to fluctuations in non U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2011 2010 change Industrial Technology $ 767,020 $ 669,882 14.5 % Energy Systems and Controls 608,538 538,861 12.9 Medical and Scientific Imaging 612,787 578,957 5.8 RF Technology 834,903 748,536 11.5 Total $ 2,823,248 $ 2,536,236 11.3 % The increase in orders was due to internal growth of 8.3%, as well as orders from acquisitions which added $78 million. Our Industrial Technology, Energy Systems and Controls and RF Technology segments experienced strong internal growth throughout 2011. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment experienced moderate internal growth. The following table summarizes order backlog information at December 31, 2011 and 2010 (dollar amounts in thousands). Our policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2011 2010 change Industrial Technology $ 141,836 $ 113,981 24.4 % Energy Systems and Controls 120,497 104,466 15.3 Medical and Scientific Imaging 118,609 103,796 14.3 RF Technology 447,355 463,115 (3.4 ) Total $ 828,297 $ 785,358 5.5 % Year Ended December 31, 2010 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2009 Net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 were $2.39 billion as compared to sales of $2.05 billion for the year ended December 31, 2009, an increase of 16.4%. The increase was the result of internal sales growth of 7.8% as well as a full year of sales from our 2009 acquisitions of UTS and Verathon and five months of sales from iTrade. Net sales of these acquisitions accounted for approximately $179 million of additional sales in 2010 over 2009. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment reported a $193.9 million or 54.7% increase in net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 over the year ended December 31, 2009. Acquisitions added $147.9 million in sales, while organic sales increased 12.5% due to broad based increases in medical, imaging and handheld computer markets. The impact from foreign exchange was a positive 1.0%, resulting in internal growth of 13.5%. In our Energy Systems and Controls segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $63.0 million or 14.3% over the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase in sales was due to broad based recovery in the markets served by the segment which led to increased demand for our instruments, valves and sensors sold into these markets. Net sales for our Industrial Technology segment increased by $71.3 million or 13.3% for the year ended December 31, 2010 over the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase was due to a broad based economic recovery in the industrial end markets, strong sales growth in our Neptune water meter business and increased sales in our materials testing businesses as customer manufacturing facilities which had experienced slowdowns or temporary shutdowns in 2009 came back on line or increased production. In our RF Technology segment, net sales for the year ended December 31, 2010 increased by $8.2 million or 1.1% over the year ended December 31, 2009. Internal sales decreased 3.2% due to delays in transportation projects due to temporary reductions in state and local governmental funding. Partial year results from the acquisition of iTrade and full year results of UTS added 4.3%. In 2009, in order to mitigate the effects of the weakened global economy on our financial results, we committed to certain severance and related cost control actions. The cost of these actions during the year ended December 31, 2009 totaled $12.4 million, $4.1 million of which was recorded as cost of goods sold and the remaining $8.3 million as SG&A expense. We had no additional material severance and related cost control actions in 2010 or 2011. Our overall gross profit percentage was 53.4% for the year ended December 31, 2010, as compared to 50.9% for the year ended December 31, 2009. Our Industrial Technology and Energy Systems and Controls segments both experienced higher gross margins due to higher sales volume while maintaining a relatively flat cost structure. Our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment gross margins increased primarily due to additional sales from medical products which have a higher gross margin. Our RF Technology segment gross margins were relatively unchanged. Selling, general and administrative expenses increased $113.1 million to $760.8 million in 2010 as compared to $647.7 million in 2009, while increasing as a percentage of net sales to 31.9% for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to 31.6% for the year ended December 31, 2009. The full year inclusion of Verathon accounted for $72 million of the increase. In addition, our research and development spending increased $19 million as we continued to invest in new product development. Interest expense increased $8.0 million, or 13.6%, for the year ended December 31, 2010 compared to the year ended December 31, 2009. The increase is due primarily to higher interest rates in the current year, which accounted for approximately $5 million of the increase, and a higher average debt balance throughout 2010. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2010 was $0.6 million, which was primarily due to gain on sale of assets offset by foreign exchange losses. Other income for the year ended December 31, 2009 was $3.5 million, primarily due to a pre tax gain of $4.1 million related to the sale of certain assets of our satellite communications business, partially offset by a $0.4 million pre tax debt extinguishment charge for the early repayment of our term loan and foreign exchange losses at our non U.S. based companies. During 2010, our effective income tax rate was 28.1% versus 29.5% in 2009. This decrease was due primarily to certain foreign tax planning initiatives and an increase in the Section 199 qualifying production activities deduction. At December 31, 2010, the functional currencies of our European subsidiaries were weaker, and the Canadian dollar stronger, against the U.S. dollar compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2009. The net result of these changes led to a decrease in the foreign exchange component of comprehensive earnings of $19.8 million in the year ending December 31, 2010. Approximately $15.5 million of these adjustments related to goodwill and are not expected to directly affect our projected future cash flows. For the entire year of 2010, operating profit decreased by less than 0.5% due to fluctuations in non U.S. currencies. The following table summarizes our net order information for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 (dollar amounts in thousands). 2010 2009 change Industrial Technology $ 669,882 $ 528,208 26.8 % Energy Systems and Controls 538,861 427,003 26.2 Medical and Scientific Imaging 578,957 349,132 65.8 RF Technology 748,536 719,666 4.0 Total $ 2,536,236 $ 2,024,009 25.3 % The increase in orders was due to internal growth of 15.8%, as well as orders from acquisitions which added $195 million. Our Industrial Technology and Energy Systems and Controls segments experienced strong internal growth throughout 2010, as did our Medical and Scientific Imaging segment which also experienced an increase of $159 million due to 2009 acquisitions. In our RF Technology segment, internal orders decreased by 1.1%, which was more than offset by acquisition growth. The following table summarizes order backlog information at December 31, 2010 and 2009 (dollar amounts in thousands). Our policy is to include in backlog only orders scheduled for shipment within twelve months. 2010 2009 change Industrial Technology $ 113,981 $ 52,079 118.9 % Energy Systems and Controls 104,466 70,901 47.3 Medical and Scientific Imaging 103,796 73,747 40.7 RF Technology 463,115 368,762 25.6 Total $ 785,358 $ 565,489 38.9 % Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 are as follows (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Cash provided by/(used in): Operating activities $ 601.6 $ 499.5 $ 367.5 Investing activities (275.7 ) (563.3 ) (374.2 ) Financing activities (256.7 ) 167.6 (13.6 ) Operating activities The increase in cash provided by operating activities in 2011 was primarily due to higher earnings over the prior year and increased intangible amortization related to recent acquisitions, offset partially by higher inventory levels and lower accounts payable balances at year end. Investing activities Cash used by investing activities during 2011, 2010, and 2009 was primarily for business acquisitions. Financing activities Cash used by financing activities in all periods was primarily debt repayments as well as dividends paid to stockholders. Cash provided by financing activities during 2010 and 2009 was primarily debt borrowings for acquisitions partially offset by debt payments made using cash from operations, and in 2009 also included $121 million of proceeds from issuance of common stock, net of issuance costs. Net working capital (current assets, excluding cash, less total current liabilities, excluding debt) was $293.1 million at December 31, 2011 compared to $281.4 million at December 31, 2010. We acquired net working capital of $5.2 million through business acquisitions during 2011. Total debt was $1.1 billion at December 31, 2011 (25.4% of total capital) compared to $1.3 billion at December 31, 2010 (32.8% of total capital). Our decreased debt at December 31, 2011 compared to December 31, 2010 was due to debt payments made using cash from operations. Our senior unsecured credit facility originally consisted of a two year $350 million term loan and a five year $750 million revolving loan; however, the term loan portion was repaid in September 2009 and cannot be reborrowed. At December 31, 2011, our debt consisted of $67.2 million in senior subordinated convertible notes due 2034, $500 million of senior notes due 2013 and $500 million of senior notes due 2019. In addition, we had $6.1 million of other debt in the form of capital leases and several smaller facilities that allow for borrowings or the issuance of letters of credit in foreign locations to support our non U.S. businesses. We had $49.6 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2011, of which $43.5 million was covered by our lending group, thereby reducing its remaining revolving credit capacity commensurately. The cash and short term investments at our foreign subsidiaries at December 31, 2011 totaled $164 million. Repatriation of these funds under current regulatory and tax law for use in domestic operations would expose us to additional taxes. We consider this cash to be permanently reinvested. We expect that cash flows from existing business combined with our available borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund operating requirements in the U.S. We were in compliance with all debt covenants related to our credit facilities throughout the year ended December 31, 2011. Capital expenditures of $40.7 million, $28.6 million and $25.9 million were incurred during 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. In the future, we expect capital expenditures as a percentage of sales to be between 1.0% and 1.5% of annual net sales. Description of Certain Indebtedness Senior Unsecured Credit Facility On July 7, 2008, we entered into a senior unsecured credit facility with JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, and a syndicate of lenders. The credit facility is composed of a five year $750 million revolving credit facility maturing July 7, 2013 and, as originally issued, a $350 million term loan facility originally maturing July 7, 2010. The $350 million term loan was repaid early in September 2009. We may also, subject to compliance with specified conditions, request additional term loans or revolving credit commitments in an aggregate amount not to exceed $350 million. The credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants which, among other things, limit our ability to incur new debt, prepay subordinated debt, make certain investments and acquisitions, sell assets and grant liens, make restricted payments (including the payment of dividends on our common stock) and capital expenditures, or change our line of business. We also are subject to financial covenants which require us to limit our consolidated total leverage ratio and to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio. The most restrictive covenant is the consolidated total leverage ratio which is limited to 3.5. Senior Notes due 2019 In September 2009, we completed a public offering of $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.25% senior unsecured notes due September 2019. Net proceeds of $496 million were used to pay off our $350 million term loan originally due July 2010 and the outstanding revolver balance under our credit facility. We recorded a $0.4 million non cash debt extinguishment charge related to the early repayment of the term loan portion of the facility. The notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.25% per year, payable semi annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, beginning March 1, 2010. We may redeem some of all of these notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount, plus a make whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities. The notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. Senior Notes due 2013 On August 6, 2008, we issued $500 million aggregate principal amount of 6.625% senior notes due August 15, 2013. These notes bear interest at a fixed rate of 6.625% per year, payable semi annually in arrears on February 15 and August 15 of each year, beginning February 15, 2009. The interest payable on the notes is subject to adjustment if either Moodys Investors Service or Standard & Poors Ratings Services downgrades the rating assigned to the notes. We may redeem some or all of the notes at any time or from time to time, at 100% of their principal amount plus a make whole premium based on a spread to U.S. Treasury securities as described in the indenture relating to the notes. The notes are unsecured senior obligations of the Company and rank equally in right of payment with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. The notes are effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The notes are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries and are effectively subordinated to all existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. During 2009 we entered into an aggregate notional amount of $500 million in interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges, which effectively changed our $500 million senior notes due 2013 with a fixed interest rate of 6.625% to a variable rate obligation at a weighted average spread of 4.377% plus the three month London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). Due to the application of fair value hedge accounting for the swaps, the notes are shown in the balance sheet net of an $11.7 million fair value adjustment at December 31, 2011 and $14.1 million at December 31, 2010. Senior Subordinated Convertible Notes In December 2003, we issued $230 million of senior subordinated convertible notes at an original issue discount of 60.498%, resulting in an effective yield of 3.75% per year to maturity. Interest on the notes was payable semi annually, beginning July 15, 2004, until January 15, 2009, after which cash interest is not paid on the notes prior to maturity unless contingent cash interest becomes payable. As of January 15, 2009, interest is recognized at the effective rate of 3.75% and represents accrual of original issue discount, excluding any contingent cash interest that may become payable. We will pay contingent cash interest to the holders of the notes during any six month period commencing after January 15, 2009 if the average trading price of a note for a five trading day measurement period preceding the applicable six month period equals 120% or more of the sum of the issue price, accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, for such note. The contingent cash interest payable per note in respect of any six month period will equal the annual rate of 0.25%. In accordance with this criterion, contingent interest has been paid for each six month period since January 15, 2009. The notes are unsecured senior subordinated obligations, rank junior to our existing and future senior secured indebtedness and rank equally with our existing and future senior subordinated indebtedness. As originally issued, each $1,000 principal amount of the notes will be convertible at the option of the holder into 12.422 shares of our common stock (giving effect to the 2 for 1 stock split effective August 26, 2005 and subject to further adjustment), if (i) the sale price of our common stock reaches, or the trading price of the notes falls below, specified thresholds, (ii) if the notes are called for redemption or (iii) if specified corporate transactions have occurred. Upon conversion, we would have the right to deliver, in lieu of common stock, cash or a combination of cash and common stock. On November 19, 2004, we began a consent solicitation to amend the notes such that we would pay the same conversion value upon conversion of the notes, but would change how the conversion value is paid. In lieu of receiving exclusively shares of common stock or cash upon conversion, noteholders would receive cash up to the value of the accreted principal amount of the notes converted and, at our option, any remainder of the conversion value would be paid in cash or shares of common stock. The consent solicitation was successfully completed on December 6, 2004 and the amended conversion provisions were adopted. As of September 30, 2005, the senior subordinated convertible notes were reclassified from long term to short term debt as the notes became convertible on October 1, 2005 based upon our common stock trading above the trigger price for at least 20 trading days during the 30 consecutive trading day period ending on September 30, 2005. Holders may require us to purchase all or a portion of their notes on January 15, 2014, January 15, 2019, January 15, 2024, and January 15, 2029, at stated prices plus accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any. We may only pay the purchase price of such notes in cash and not in common stock. We may redeem for cash all or a portion of the notes at any time at redemption prices equal to the sum of the issue price plus accrued original issue discount and accrued cash interest, if any, including contingent cash interest, if any, on such notes to the applicable redemption date. The Company includes in its diluted weighted average common share calculation an increase in shares based upon the difference between our average closing stock price for the period and the conversion price of $31.80, plus accretion. This is calculated using the treasury stock method. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commercial Commitments and Contingencies The following tables quantify our contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments at December 31, 2011 (in thousands). Contractual Cash Obligations1 Total Payments Due in Fiscal Year 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Long term debt $ 1,079,916 $ 67,975 $ 511,719 $ 67 $ 67 $ 53 $ 500,035 Senior note interest2 239,583 31,250 31,250 31,250 31,250 31,250 83,333 Capital leases 5,100 1,931 1,312 721 489 440 207 Operating leases 126,126 33,262 26,525 22,454 17,314 12,590 13,981 Total $ 1,450,725 $ 134,418 $ 570,806 $ 54,492 $ 49,120 $ 44,333 $ 597,556 Other Commercial Commitments Total Amount Committed Amounts Expiring in Fiscal Year 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Standby letters of credit and bank guarantees $ 49,608 $ 36,765 $ 7,330 $ 542 $ 731 $ 826 $ 3,414 1. We have excluded $19.6 million related to the liability for uncertain tax positions from the tables as the current portion is not material, and we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long term portion of the liability. See Note 8 of the notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 2. We have excluded interest on the senior notes due 2013, as they have been effectively converted to variable rate debt due to interest rate swaps. See Description of Certain Indebtedness above. At December 31, 2011, we had outstanding surety bonds of $313 million. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships, such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities, which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes. We believe that internally generated cash flows and the remaining availability under our credit facilities will be adequate to finance normal operating requirements and future acquisition activities. Although we maintain an active acquisition program, any future acquisitions will be dependent on numerous factors and it is not feasible to reasonably estimate if or when any such acquisitions will occur and what the impact will be on our activities, financial condition and results of operations. We may also explore alternatives to attract additional capital resources. We anticipate that our recently acquired businesses as well as our other businesses will generate positive cash flows from operating activities, and that these cash flows will permit the reduction of currently outstanding debt in accordance with the repayment schedule. However, the rate at which we can reduce our debt during 2012 (and reduce the associated interest expense) will be affected by, among other things, the financing and operating requirements of any new acquisitions and the financial performance of our existing companies. None of these factors can be predicted with certainty. Recently Issued Accounting Standards See Note 1 of our notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to interest rate risks on our outstanding borrowings, and to foreign currency exchange risks on our transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. We are also exposed to equity market risks pertaining to the traded price of our common stock. At December 31, 2011, we had a combination of fixed and floating rate borrowings. Our credit facility contains a $750 million variable rate revolver; however, there were no outstanding revolver borrowings at December 31, 2011. Our $500 million senior notes due 2019 have a fixed interest rate of 6.25%, and our $67 million senior unsecured convertible notes have a fixed interest rate of 3.75%. Our $500 million senior notes due 2013 have a fixed interest rate of 6.625%; however, in October 2009 we entered into three interest rate swap agreements totaling $500 million that expire August 2013. The swaps, which are designated as fair value hedges, effectively convert the notes to a weighted average variable rate obligation with a spread of 4.377% plus LIBOR. At December 31, 2011, the prevailing market rates for our long term notes were between 2.5% and 5.1% lower than the fixed rates on our debt instruments. At December 31, 2011, our outstanding variable rate borrowing was the $500 million senior notes due 2013. An increase in interest rates of 1% would increase our annualized interest costs by $5.0 million. Several of our businesses have transactions and balances denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Most of these transactions or balances are denominated in euros, Canadian dollars, British pounds or Danish krone. Sales by companies whose functional currency was not the U.S. dollar were 27% of our total sales and 63% of these sales were by companies with a European functional currency. The U.S. dollar was weaker against most currencies throughout most of 2011 as compared to 2010, which resulted in an increase in sales of 1.4% due to foreign currency exchange. If these currency exchange rates had been 10% different throughout 2011 compared to currency exchange rates actually experienced, the impact on our net earnings would have been approximately 2.7%. The changes in these currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar at December 31, 2011 compared to currency exchange rates at December 31, 2010 resulted in a decrease in net assets of $11.0 million that was reported as a component of comprehensive earnings, $5.1 million of which was attributed to goodwill. Goodwill changes from currency exchange rate changes do not directly affect our reported earnings or cash flows. The trading price of our common stock influences the valuation of stock award grants and the effects these grants have on our results of operations. The stock price also influences the computation of potentially dilutive common stock which includes both stock awards and the premium over the conversion price on senior subordinated convertible notes to determine diluted earnings per share. The stock price also affects our employees perceptions of programs that involve our common stock. We believe the quantification of the effects of these changing prices on our future earnings and cash flows is not readily determinable.
