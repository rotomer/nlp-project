ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The fiscal years ended February 2, 2002, February 3, 2001 and January 29, 2000 are referred to as 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Fiscal 2001 and 1999 were 52 week years, and fiscal 2000 was a 53 week year. Results of Operations Year Ended February 2, 2002 Year Ended February 3, 2001 Year Ended January 29, 2000 SALES Sales (millions) $ 2,987 $ 2,709 $ 2,469 Sales growth 10 % 10 % 13 % Comparable store sales growth 3 % 1 % 6 % COST AND EXPENSES (as a percent of sales) Cost of goods sold and occupancy 69.3 % 69.1 % 69.0 % General, selling and administrative 20.4 % 19.9 % 19.2 % Depreciation and amortization 1.7 % 1.6 % 1.6 % Interest expense 0.1 % 0.1 % 0 % Provision for litigation expense 0 % 0 % 0.4 % EARNINGS BEFORE TAXES 8.5 % 9.2 % 10.0 % NET EARNINGS 5.2 % 5.6 % 6.1 % Stores. Total stores open at the end of 2001, 2000 and 1999 were 452, 409 and 378, respectively. 2001 2000 1999 Stores at the beginning of the period 409 378 349 Stores opened in the period 45 34 34 Stores closed in the period (2 ) (3 ) (5 ) Stores at the end of the period 452 409 378 Selling square footage at the end of the period (000) 10,484 9,330 8,544 Sales. The 10% total sales increase for 2001 reflects a 3% increase in comparable store sales, the opening of 43 net new stores in 2001, and the full year impact of 2000 store openings. The 10% total sales increase in 2000 reflects a 1% increase in comparable store sales, the opening of 31 net new stores, and the full year impact of 1999 store openings. The 13% total sales increase in 1999 reflects a 6% increase in comparable store sales, the opening of 29 net new stores, and the full year impact of 1998 store openings. The company anticipates that the competitive climate for apparel and off price retailers will continue in 2002. Management expects to address that challenge by pursuing and refining the companys existing strategy and by continuing to strengthen the merchandise organization, diversifying the merchandise mix, and more fully developing the organization and systems to strengthen regional merchandise offerings. Although the companys existing strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales and earnings gains in 2001, 2000 and 1999, there can be no assurance that these strategies will result in a continuation of revenue and profit growth. Cost of Goods Sold and Occupancy. The increase in the cost of goods sold and occupancy ratio in 2001 compared to 2000 resulted mainly from a lower initial mark up and a lower leverage on occupancy costs in 2001 when compared to the 53 weeks in fiscal 2000, partially offset by lower freight costs as a percentage of sales. The increase in the cost of goods sold and occupancy ratio in 2000 13 compared to 1999 resulted mainly from an increase in freight expense and a higher rate of markdowns, partially offset by a slightly higher initial mark up. There can be no assurance that the gross profit margins realized in 2001, 2000 and 1999 will continue in future years. General, Selling and Administrative Expenses. During 2001 and 2000, general, selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales rose primarily due to higher store payroll and benefit costs and an increase in distribution center expenses. The largest component of general, selling and administrative expenses is payroll. The total number of employees, including both full and part time, at year end 2001, 2000 and 1999 was approximately 21,000, 19,800 and 18,400, respectively. Depreciation and Amortization. Depreciation and amortization as a percentage of sales have remained relatively constant over the last three years, due primarily to the consistent level of fixed assets in each store. Provision for Litigation Expense. In 1999 the company recorded a non recurring pre tax charge of $9.0 million, without any admission of wrongdoing, related to the settlement of a class action complaint alleging that store managers and assistant managers in California were incorrectly classified as exempt from state overtime laws. The Settlement was paid in 2000. See Note H of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Taxes on Earnings. The companys effective tax rate for 2001, 2000 and 1999 was 39%, which represents the applicable federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit received for state taxes. During 2002, the company expects its effective tax rate to remain at approximately 39%. Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources. 2001 2000 1999 ($ in 000s) Cash flows from Operating activities $ 242,889 $ 143,349 $ 183,366 Cash flows from Investing activities (86,002 ) (82,114 ) (74,012 ) Cash flows from Financing activities (153,690 ) (103,410 ) (110,108 ) Net increase (decrease) $ 3,197 $ (42,175 ) $ (754 ) During 2001, the primary uses of cash, other than for operating expenditures, were for merchandise inventory, property and equipment to open 45 new stores, the relocation, remodeling or expansion of 14 stores, the repurchase in the open market of $131 million of the companys common stock, and quarterly cash dividend payments. During 2000, the primary uses of cash, other than for operating expenditures, were for merchandise inventory, property and equipment to open 34 new stores, the relocation, remodeling or expansion of 21 stores, the repurchase in the open market of $169 million of the companys common stock, and quarterly cash dividend payments. During 1999, the primary uses of cash, other than for operating expenditures, were for merchandise inventory, property and equipment to open 34 new stores, the relocation, remodeling or expansion of 14 stores, the repurchase in the open market of $120 million of the companys common stock, and quarterly cash dividend payments. In 2001, 2000 and 1999, the company spent approximately $86 million, $82 million and $74 million, respectively, for capital expenditures, net of leased equipment, that included fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new stores; relocate, remodel or expand existing stores; purchase previously leased equipment; update management information systems; and various other expenditures for existing stores and the central office. 14 In 2001, cash flows increased primarily due to a higher accounts payable balance as a percent of inventory, lower tax payments due to timing differences, and increased issuance of common stock related to stock option exercises. In 2000, cash flows decreased primarily due to higher repurchases of common stock and a lower accounts payable balance as a percentage of inventory. Working capital was $225 million at the end of 2001, compared to $197 million at the end of 2000 and $191 million at the end of 1999. At year end 2001, 2000 and 1999, the companys current ratios were 1.5:1, 1.5:1 and 1.5:1, respectively. The companys primary source of liquidity is the sale of its merchandise inventory. Management regularly reviews the age and condition of the merchandise and is able to maintain current inventory in its stores through the replenishment processes and liquidation of non current merchandise through clearance markdowns. During 2001, 2000 and 1999, liquidity and capital requirements were provided by cash flows from operations, bank credit facilities and trade credit. The companys store sites, certain warehouses and buying offices are leased and, except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment, do not represent long term capital investments. The company owns its distribution center and corporate headquarters in Newark, California, and its distribution center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Short term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for investments in merchandise inventory. Trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with the companys vendors. Management regularly reviews the adequacy of credit available to the company from all sources and has been able to maintain adequate lines to meet the capital and liquidity requirements of the company. The table below presents significant contractual payment obligations of the company at year end 2001. Contractual Obligations Less than 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Total ($ in 000s) Long term debt Operating leases $ 145,428 $ 263,489 $ 206,381 $ 376,284 $ 991,582 Synthetic leases 1,512 8,400 7,132 17,044 Other long term obligations 175,000 175,000 Total contractual obligations $ 146,940 $ 271,889 $ 388,513 $ 376,284 $ 1,183,626 Long Term Debt. At February 2, 2002, the company did not have any long term debt outstanding. Operating Leases. The companys store sites, certain warehouses and buying offices are leased and except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment, do not represent long term capital investments. The company owns its distribution center and corporate headquarters in Newark, California, and its distribution center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Distribution Center Financings. The company is constructing a new 1.3 million square foot distribution center in South Carolina, which is expected to be complete in July 2002. This center, including equipment and systems, is being financed under a $95 million, five year operating lease, commonly referred to as a synthetic lease, which expires in March 2006. Upon completion, rent expense on the center will be payable monthly at the current rate of 90 basis points over 30 day LIBOR. At the end of the lease term, the company must refinance the $95 million synthetic lease facility, purchase the distribution center at cost, or arrange a sale of the distribution center to a third party. The companys potential estimated purchase obligation of $95 million is included in Other long term obligations in the table above. 15 In April 2002, construction began on another 1.3 million square foot distribution center, which is expected to be complete in August 2003. This new center is located in Perris, California about 70 miles southeast of Los Angeles, a desirable location for both sourcing and shipping of product. Approximately 25% of the companys store base is in the southwest region of the country, and the majority of its west coast merchandise receipts originate in Southern California. The Perris distribution center will feature the same warehouse management systems and technology being installed in the new South Carolina center. The company believes the new Perris center should improve supply chain logistics and efficiencies, and result in higher distribution center productivity and lower freight costs. As a result, the company plans to transfer its primary west coast distribution capabilities from its current 18 year old Newark distribution center to the new Perris center during the third quarter of 2003, or once the Perris center is fully operational. The land and building portion of the new Perris center is being financed under an $80 million, five year synthetic lease facility, which expires in December 2006. Upon completion, rent expense on this center will be payable monthly at the current rate of approximately 85 basis points over the applicable commercial paper or 30 day LIBOR rate. At the end of the lease term, the company must refinance the $80 million synthetic lease facility, purchase the distribution center at cost, or arrange a sale of the distribution center to a third party. If the distribution center is sold to a third party for less than the amount financed by the lessor, or $80 million, the company has agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor up to 87% of the amount financed. The companys potential estimated purchase obligation of $80 million is included in Other long term obligations in the table above. Management expects to finance the equipment and systems for the Perris, California center with a $50 million, five year unsecured borrowing facility. The two synthetic lease facilities described above have covenant restrictions generally consistent with the companys revolving credit agreement. In addition, the credit spread under these agreements may vary depending on certain interest coverage ratio tests that are generally consistent with the companys revolving credit agreement. The companys future obligations under both synthetic leases are included in Synthetic leases in the table above. The table below presents significant commercial credit facilities available to the company at year end 2001. Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Commercial Credit Commitments Less than 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Total Amount Committed ($ in 000s) Revolving credit facility* $ $ 350,000 $ $ $ 350,000 Standby letters of credit 28,767 28,767 Total commercial commitments $ 28,767 $ 350,000 $ $ $ 378,767 *Contains a $75 million sublimit for issuances of letter of credit. For additional information relating to these credit facilities, refer to Note B of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements Revolving Credit Facility. In August 2001, the company entered into a new three year, $350 million revolving credit facility with its banks, which contains a $75 million sublimit for issuances of letters of credit, replacing its prior $160 million bank credit agreement, $30 million letter of credit facility, and $35 million uncommitted bank line arrangement. Interest is LIBOR based and is payable upon borrowing maturity but no less than quarterly. Borrowing under this credit facility is subject to the company maintaining certain interest rate coverage and leverage ratios. At year end 2001 the company had no amounts outstanding under the new facility. 16 Standby Letters of Credit. The company had $28.8 million and $12.6 million in standby letters of credit outstanding at year end 2001 and 2000, respectively. Trade Letters of Credit. The company had $9.7 million and $11.8 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at year end 2001 and 2000, respectively. Capital Expenditures. The company is forecasting approximately $105 million to $120 million in capital expenditures for fiscal 2002 to fund fixtures and leasehold improvements to open about 50 to 55 net new stores, relocate, remodel or expand numerous existing stores, and to make investments in store and merchandising systems, distribution center equipment and systems and various central office expenditures. Dividends. In January 2002, a quarterly cash dividend payment of $.0475 per common share was declared by the companys Board of Directors, payable on or about April 1, 2002. The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $.0425 per common share in January, May, August and November 2001 and $.0375 per common share in January, May, August and November 2000. Stock Repurchase Program. In January 2002, the company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to $300 million over two years. The company repurchased a total of $131 million and $169 million of common stock during 2001 and 2000, respectively, under a prior program. The company estimates that cash flows from operations, existing bank credit lines and trade credit are adequate to meet operating cash needs, fund the aforementioned planned capital investments, repurchase common stock and make quarterly dividend payments for at least the next twelve months. New Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, requires the company to record all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and to measure those instruments at fair value, and is effective for all fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2000. The company implemented SFAS No. 133, as amended, on February 4, 2001. Adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the companys financial position or results of operations. In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141, "Business Combinations" (effective July 1, 2001) and SFAS No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" (effective for the company on February 3, 2002). SFAS No. 141 prohibits pooling of interests accounting for acquisitions. SFAS No. 142 specifies that goodwill and certain intangible assets will no longer be amortized but instead will be subject to periodic impairment testing. The adoption of the new standards is not expected to have a material impact on the companys financial position or results of operations. In October 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets." This statement supercedes SFAS No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of," and the accounting and reporting provisions of APB Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions," for the disposal of a segment of a business. SFAS No. 144 became effective for the company on February 3, 2002. Adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material effect on the companys financial position or results of operations. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that 17 are believed to be reasonable. Estimates and assumptions include, but are not limited to, long lived assets and the review of their impairment, self insurance reserves, and sales return reserve. The estimate recorded for self insurance reserves for workers compensation and general liabilities is the companys most critical estimate and assumption used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The self insurance liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of the medical profession increase beyond what was anticipated, reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional costs to the consolidated financial statements could be required. Forward Looking Statements and Factors Affecting Future Performance This report includes a number of forward looking statements, which reflect the companys current beliefs and estimates with respect to future events and the companys future financial performance, operations and competitive position. The words "expect," "anticipate," "estimate," "believe," "looking ahead," "forecast," "plan" and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. The companys continued success depends, in part, upon its ability to increase sales at existing locations, to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis. There can be no assurance that the companys existing strategies and store expansion program will result in a continuation of revenue and profit growth. Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue and profitability remain difficult to predict. The forward looking statements that are contained in this report are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the companys actual results to differ materially from historical results or current expectations. These factors include, without limitation, a general deterioration in economic trends, ongoing competitive pressures in the apparel industry, the companys ability to obtain acceptable store locations, the companys ability to continue to purchase attractive name brand merchandise at desirable discounts, the companys ability to successfully open distribution centers in South Carolina and Southern California in a timely and cost effective manner, the companys ability to successfully extend its geographic reach into new markets, unseasonable weather trends, changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences in apparel or home related merchandise, the companys ability to attract and retain the retail talent necessary to execute its strategies, the companys ability to implement and integrate various new systems and technologies, and greater than planned costs. In addition, the companys corporate headquarters, one of its distribution centers and 37% of its stores are located in California. Therefore, a downturn in the California economy or a major natural disaster there could significantly affect the companys operating results and financial condition. In addition to the above factors, the apparel industry is highly seasonal. The combined sales of the company for the third quarter and fourth (holiday) fiscal quarter are historically higher than the combined sales for the first two fiscal quarters. The company has realized a significant portion of its profits in each fiscal year during the fourth quarter. If intensified price competition, lower than anticipated consumer demand or other factors were to occur during the third and fourth quarters, and in particular during the fourth quarter, the companys fiscal year results could be adversely affected. 18   ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to market risks, which primarily includes changes in interest rates. The company does not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes. Interest that is payable on the companys credit facilities is based on variable interest rates and is, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. In addition, lease payments under the companys synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. These lease payments will begin upon completion of construction of each new distribution center. As of February 2, 2002, the company did not have any long term debt outstanding. The company does not use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio. 19
