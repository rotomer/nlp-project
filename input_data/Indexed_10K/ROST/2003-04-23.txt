ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The fiscal years ended February 1, 2003, February 2, 2002 and February 3, 2001 are referred to as 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Fiscal years 2002 and 2001 are 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2000 is 53 weeks. Results of Operations Year Ended February 1, 2003 Year Ended February 2, 2002 Year Ended February 3, 2001 SALES Sales (millions) $3,531 $2,987 $2,709 Sales growth 18 % 10 % 10 % Comparable store sales growth 7 % 3 % 1 % COST AND EXPENSES (as a percent of sales) Cost of goods sold, including related buying, distribution and occupancy costs 74.4 % 75.1 % 74.5 % General, selling and administrative 16.2 % 16.3 % 16.2 % Interest expense 0.0 % 0.1 % 0.1 % EARNINGS BEFORE TAXES 9.4 % 8.5 % 9.2 % NET EARNINGS 5.7 % 5.2 % 5.6 % In fiscal 2002, the Company reclassified buying and distribution costs that were previously included with general, selling and administrative expenses to cost of goods sold. In addition, cost of goods sold also includes occupancy costs as well as depreciation and amortization related to the Companys retail stores, buying and distribution operations. Included in general, selling and administrative expenses are costs related to store operating expenses as well as general and administrative expenses including related depreciation and occupancy costs. Fiscal 2001 and 2000 have been reclassified to conform to the fiscal 2002 presentation. Stores. Total stores open at the end of 2002, 2001 and 2000 were 507, 452 and 409, respectively. Selling square footage at the end of 2002, 2001 and 2000 increased by 13%, 12% and 9%, respectively. The increased rate of growth in 2002 and 2001 compared to prior years reflected the Companys entry into new markets. 2002 2001 2000 Stores at the beginning of the period 452 409 378 Stores opened in the period 60 45 34 Stores closed in the period (5 ) (2 ) (3 ) Stores at the end of the period 507 452 409 Selling square footage at the end of the period (000) 11,843 10,484 9,330 Sales. The 18% total sales increase for 2002 reflects a 7% increase in sales from comparable stores (stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months), the opening of 55 net new stores in 2002, and the full year impact of 2001 store openings. The 10% total sales increase for 2001 reflects a 3% increase in sales from comparable stores, the opening of 43 net new stores in 2001, and the full year impact of 2000 store openings. The 10% total sales increase in 2000 reflects a 1% increase in comparable store sales, the opening of 31 net new stores, and the full year impact of 1999 store openings. 12 The Companys sales mix as shown below reflects the growth in home businesses which was a key contributor to comparable store sales growth in 2002 and 2001: 2002 2001 2000 Ladies 34 % 34 % 33 % Home accents and bed and bath 19 % 18 % 17 % Mens 18 % 19 % 21 % Fine jewelry, accessories, lingerie and fragrances 12 % 12 % 12 % Childrens 9 % 10 % 9 % Shoes 8 % 7 % 8 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Management expects to address the competitive climate for apparel and off price retailers by pursuing and refining the Companys existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen the merchandise organization, diversifying the merchandise mix, and more fully developing the organization and systems to strengthen regional merchandise offerings. Although the Companys existing strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales and earnings gains in 2002, 2001 and 2000, there can be no assurance that these strategies will result in a continuation of revenue and profit growth. Cost of Goods Sold. The decrease in the cost of goods sold ratio in 2002 compared to 2001 resulted in part from higher leverage on buying, distribution, occupancy and depreciation costs in 2002 when compared to 2001. Buying and distribution costs as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately 30 basis points from 2001, which is largely attributable to improved leverage resulting from a 7% comparable store sales increase and distribution processing efficiencies. The 7% increase in comparable store sales also resulted in an approximate 25 basis point reduction in store occupancy and depreciation as a percentage of sales when compared to 2001. In addition, the Company realized about 15 basis points of improvement in merchandise margins in 2002 as compared to 2001 due primarily to lower markdowns and improved shortage results, partially offset by higher freight costs and a reduction in initial markup due to our sharper pricing strategy. The increase in the cost of goods sold ratio in 2001 compared to 2000 resulted in part from higher distribution center expenses and reduced leverage on occupancy and buying costs in 2001 when compared to 2000. Buying and distribution costs as a percentage of sales increased by approximately 40 basis points in 2001 mainly as a result of higher third party distribution processing costs. Store occupancy and depreciation as a percentage of sales increased by approximately 10 basis points when compared to 2000 due primarily to an 11% increase in new store openings as compared to an 8% gain in the prior year. In addition, the Company realized about 10 basis points in lower merchandise margins in 2001 as compared to 2000 due primarily to a reduction on initial markup due to an improved mix of brand name merchandise. There can be no assurance that the gross profit margins realized in 2002, 2001 and 2000 will continue in future years. General, Selling and Administrative Expenses. Total general, selling and administrative expenses (GS&A) were $572.3 million in 2002, an $86.9 million increase from 2001. During 2002, GS&A as a percentage of sales decreased slightly due primarily to higher leverage on store payroll, benefit costs and operating costs, partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation costs. Store operating costs as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately 20 basis points from 2001, due primarily to improved leverage resulting from a 7% comparable store sales increase. General and administrative costs as a percentage of sales grew by approximately 15 basis points in 2002 due mainly to an increase in incentive compensation costs, partially offset by improved leverage. 13 Total GS&A was $485.5 million in 2001, a $47.0 million increase from 2000. During 2001, GS&A as a percentage of sales rose primarily due to higher store payroll and operating costs as compared to 2000. Store operating costs as a percentage of sales increased by approximately 25 basis points from 2000, due mainly to higher payroll and benefit costs as compared to the prior year. General and administrative costs as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately 20 basis points primarily due to improved leverage. The largest component of GS&A is payroll. The total number of employees, including both full and part time, at year end 2002, 2001 and 2000 was approximately 22,500, 21,000 and 19,800, respectively. Interest Expense. The decrease in interest expense in 2002 as compared to 2001 and 2000 as a percentage of sales is mainly due to lower average borrowings. Taxes on Earnings. The Companys effective tax rate for 2002, 2001 and 2000 was approximately 39%, which represents the applicable federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit received for state taxes. During 2003, the Company expects its effective tax rate to remain at approximately 39%. Net Earnings. The increase in net earnings as a percentage of sales in 2002 as compared to 2001 is primarily due to improved leverage realized from the increase in comparable store sales growth on store expenses and on buying, distribution, occupancy, and depreciation costs in 2002 when compared to 2001, combined with slightly higher merchandise margins, which was partially offset by higher incentive compensation costs. Diluted earnings per share in 2002 increased by 32% to $2.52 from $1.91 in 2001. This increase is attributable to the 30% increase in net earnings and a 2% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding. The decrease in net earnings as a percentage of sales in 2001 as compared to 2000 is primarily due to higher distribution, payroll and benefit costs, partially offset by improved leverage on fixed expenses. Diluted earnings per share in 2001 increased by 5% to $1.91 from $1.82 in 2000. This increase is attributable to the 2% increase in net earnings and a 3% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources. ($000) 2002 2001 2000 Cash flows from Operating activities $ 332,445 $ 242,889 $ 143,349 Cash flows used in Investing activities (133,166 ) (86,002 ) (82,114 ) Cash flows used in Financing activities (88,981 ) (153,690 ) (103,410 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 110,298 $ 3,197 $ (42,175 ) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $332.4 million, $242.9 million and $143.3 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The primary source of cash from operations in 2002, 2001 and 2000 is related to net earnings excluding non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization, higher accounts payable and other accrued expense balances, partially offset by cash used to finance an increase in merchandise inventories. Working capital was $296 million at the end of 2002, compared to $225 million at the end of 2001 and $197 million at the end of 2000. The Company had a current ratio of 1.5:1 in 2002, 2001 and 2000. The Companys primary source of liquidity is the sale of its merchandise inventory. Management regularly reviews the age and condition of the merchandise and is able to maintain current inventory in its stores through the replenishment processes and liquidation of non current merchandise through clearance markdowns. 14 Investing Activities In 2002, 2001 and 2000, the Company spent approximately $133.2 million, $86.0 million and $82.1 million, respectively, for capital expenditures (net of leased equipment) related primarily to fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new stores; relocate, remodel or expand existing stores; update management information systems; and various other expenditures for existing stores, distribution centers and the central office. The Company opened 60, 45 and 34 new stores and relocated, remodeled or expanded 1, 14 and 21 stores in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The Company is forecasting approximately $150 million in capital expenditures for fiscal 2003 to fund fixtures and leasehold improvements to open about 66 new stores, relocate, remodel or expand existing stores, and to make investments in store and merchandising systems, distribution center equipment and systems and various central office expenditures. Financing Activities During 2002, 2001 and 2000, liquidity and capital requirements were provided by cash flows from operations, bank credit facilities and trade credit. Substantially all of the Companys store sites, certain warehouses and buying offices are leased and, except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment, do not represent long term capital investments. The Company owns its distribution center and corporate headquarters in Newark, California, and its distribution center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Short term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for investments in merchandise inventory. Trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with the Companys vendors. Management regularly reviews the adequacy of credit available to the Company from all sources and has been able to maintain adequate lines to meet the capital and liquidity requirements of the Company. The table below presents significant contractual payment obligations of the Company at year end 2002. Contractual Obligations ($000) Less than 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Total Long term debt $ $ $ 50,000 $ $ 50,000 Operating leases 182,695 321,302 260,241 345,579 1,109,817 Distribution Center Financings: Synthetic leases 3,173 6,964 1,816 11,953 Other synthetic lease obligations 167,329 167,329 Total contractual obligations $ 185,868 $ 328,266 $ 479,386 $ 345,579 $ 1,339,099 Long Term Debt. In June 2002, the Company entered into a new $50 million senior unsecured term loan agreement to finance the equipment and information systems for the new Southern California distribution center currently under construction. The Company borrowed $25 million under this term loan in September 2002 and made the final draw of $25 million under this term loan in February 2003. Interest is payable no less than quarterly at the banks applicable prime rate or at LIBOR plus an applicable margin (currently 150 basis points) which resulted in an effective interest rate of 2.8% at February 1, 2003. All amounts outstanding under the term loan will be due and payable in December 2006. Borrowings under this term loan are subject to certain operating and financial covenants including maintaining certain interest rate coverage and leverage ratios. As of February 1, 2003, $25 million was outstanding under this term loan. 15 Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. Operating Leases. Substantially all of the Companys store sites, certain warehouses and buying offices are leased. The Company owns its distribution center and corporate headquarters in Newark, California, and its distribution center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. Distribution Center Financings. The Company leases a new 1.3 million square foot distribution center in Fort Mill, South Carolina, which was completed in July 2002. This center, including equipment and systems, is being financed under an $87.3 million, five year operating lease, commonly referred to as a synthetic lease, which expires in May 2006. Monthly rent expense is currently payable at 75 basis points over 30 day LIBOR. At the end of the lease term, the Company must refinance the $87.3 million synthetic lease facility, purchase the distribution center at cost, or arrange a sale of the distribution center to a third party. The Company has agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor up to 85% of the amount financed. The Companys potential estimated purchase obligation of $87.3 million is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the table above. In April 2002, construction began on another 1.3 million square foot distribution center, which is expected to be complete in the third quarter of 2003. This new center is located in Perris, California approximately 70 miles southeast of Los Angeles, a desirable location for both sourcing and shipping of product. More than 25% of the Companys store base is in the southwest region of the country, and the majority of its west coast merchandise receipts originate in Southern California. The Perris distribution center will feature the same warehouse management systems and technology installed in the new South Carolina center. The Company believes the new Perris center should improve supply chain logistics and efficiencies, and result in higher distribution center productivity and improved freight costs. As a result, the Company plans to transfer its primary west coast distribution capabilities from its current 19 year old Newark distribution center to the new Perris center during the third quarter of 2003. The land and building portion of the new Perris center is being financed under an $80 million, five year synthetic lease facility, which expires in December 2006. Upon completion, rent expense on this center will be payable monthly at the applicable margin (currently 71 basis points) over the applicable commercial paper rate or 30 day LIBOR. At the end of the lease term, the Company must refinance the $80 million synthetic lease facility, purchase the distribution center at cost, or arrange a sale of the distribution center to a third party. If the distribution center is sold to a third party for less than the amount financed by the lessor, or $80 million, the Company has agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor up to 87% of the amount financed. The Companys potential estimated purchase obligation of $80 million is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the table above. The equipment and systems for the Perris, California center were financed with the $50 million, five year senior unsecured term debt facility, which is included in Long term debt in the table above. The two synthetic lease facilities described above have covenant restrictions requiring maintaining certain interest rate coverage and leverage ratios. In addition, the interest rates under these agreements may vary depending on the Companys actual interest coverage ratios. These synthetic lease facilities are not included in the Companys consolidated balance sheet as of February 1, 2003. The Financial Accounting Standards Board has recently issued authoritative guidance which could require the Company to consolidate the underlying assets and liabilities of one or both of these synthetic lease facilities in our consolidated balance sheet. See further discussion under New Accounting Pronouncements. 16 The table below presents significant commercial credit facilities available to the Company at year end 2002. ($000) Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Total Amount Committed Commercial Credit Commitments Less than 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years Over 5 Years Revolving credit facility* $ $ 350,000 $ $ $ 350,000 Standby letters of credit 5,400 68,927 74,327 Total commercial commitments $ 5,400 $ 418,927 $ $ $ 424,327 * Contains a $75 million sublimit for issuances of letters of credit, $46.8 million of which is available as of February 1, 2003. For additional information relating to these credit facilities, refer to Note B of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revolving Credit Facility. In August 2001, the Company entered into a new three year, $350 million revolving credit facility with its banks, which contains a $75 million sublimit for issuances of letters of credit, replacing its prior $160 million bank credit agreement, $30 million letter of credit facility, and $35 million uncommitted bank line arrangement. Interest is LIBOR based plus an applicable margin (currently 88 basis points) and is payable upon borrowing maturity but no less than quarterly. Borrowing under this credit facility is subject to the Company maintaining certain interest rate coverage and leverage ratios. As of February 1, 2003, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. Standby Letters of Credit. The Company had $74.3 million and $28.8 million in standby letters of credit outstanding at year end 2002 and 2001, respectively. Trade Letters of Credit. The Company had $14.3 million and $9.7 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at year end 2002 and 2001, respectively. Dividends. In January 2003, a quarterly cash dividend payment of $.0575 per common share was declared by the Companys Board of Directors, payable on or about April 1, 2003. The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $.0475 per common share in January, May, August and November 2002 and $.0425 per common share in January, May, August and November 2001. Stock Repurchase Program. In January 2002, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to $300 million over two years. The Company repurchased a total of $150 million of common stock during 2002 under this program and expects to complete the remaining $150 million authorization in 2003. The Company repurchased a total of $131 million of common stock during 2001 under a prior program. The Company estimates that cash flows from operations, existing bank credit lines and trade credit are adequate to meet operating cash needs, fund the aforementioned planned capital investments, repurchase common stock and make quarterly dividend payments for at least the next twelve months. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs. SFAS No. 146 supersedes previous accounting guidance, principally Emerging Issues Task Force Issue No. 94 3 and is effective for restructuring activities, if any, initiated after December 31, 2002. SFAS No. 146 requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred. Under Issue No. 94 3, a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the Companys commitment to an exit plan. SFAS No. 146 also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at 17 its fair value. Accordingly, SFAS No. 146 may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs, if any, as well as the amounts recognized, but will have no impact on exit liabilities recorded by the Company prior to December 31, 2002. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This statement amends FASB SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, SFAS No. 148 amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. The adoption of SFAS No. 148 did not have a material impact on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN 45 elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. It also requires that a guarantor recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002; while, the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after December 15, 2002. The adoption of FIN 45 did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. On January 17, 2003, the FASB issued FIN 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of entities that are not controllable through voting interests or in which the equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks and rewards. These entities have been commonly referred to as "special purpose entities." The underlying principle behind FIN 46 is that if a business enterprise has the majority financial interest in an entity, defined in the guidance as a variable interest entity, the assets, liabilities, and results of the activities of the variable interest entity should be included in consolidated financial statements with those of the business enterprise. FIN 46 explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise should assess its interest in an entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. The Company will apply the provisions of FIN 46 prospectively for all variable interest entities created after January 31, 2003. For variable interest entities created before January 31, 2003, the Company will be required to consolidate all entities in which it was deemed to be the primary beneficiary beginning in the third quarter of 2003. As of February 1, 2003, the Company was party to an agreement with a variable interest entity to finance and lease the Perris, California distribution center as further described in Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Under existing accounting guidance, neither the project assets nor related obligations are currently included in the Companys balance sheets. As the variable interest entity is currently structured, the Company would be considered the primary beneficiary under FIN 46 and would be required to consolidate the entity beginning in the third quarter of 2003. FIN 46 requires that the Company consolidate the assets, liabilities, and noncontrolling interests of the variable interest entities at their carrying amounts as if FIN 46 had been effective when the enterprise first met the conditions to be the primary beneficiary. Based upon the project costs incurred through February 1, 2003, consolidation of the variable interest entities would result in an additional $40 million in property and related debt as of February 1, 2003. The Company expects to spend a total of approximately $80 million upon completion of the Perris distribution center, which would result in an $80 million increase in property and 18 related debt and approximately $2.3 million of annual depreciation if the Company were to consolidate this variable interest entity. The Company may consider other financing structures for these projects in the future which may result in non consolidation under FIN 46. The Company does not anticipate the changes in accounting requirements to impact planned levels of financing or its credit ratings. The Company was also a party to an $87 million synthetic lease facility for its South Carolina distribution center as further described in Note C of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company believes that consolidation of this synthetic lease will not be required under FIN 46 because the lessor/owner of the distribution center is not a variable interest entity. Further guidance or clarification related to FIN 46 may be issued by the FASB, Securities and Exchange Commission, or other authoritative bodies which could impact the accounting for this synthetic lease. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: Inventory. The Companys merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost method. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, or if sales of the inventory are more difficult than anticipated, additional inventory write downs may be required. Long lived Assets. The Company records a long lived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. In the course of performing this analysis, management determined that no long lived asset impairment charge was required for years ended February 1, 2003, February 2, 2002 and February 3, 2001. Should actual results differ materially from projected results, an impairment charge may be required in the future. Self Insurance. The Company self insures certain of its workers compensation and general liability risks as well as certain of its health insurance plans. The Companys self insurance liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of the medical profession and state statutory requirements increase beyond what was anticipated, reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required. The above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the Companys accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles, with no need for managements judgment in their application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. See the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles. Forward Looking Statements and Factors Affecting Future Performance This report includes a number of forward looking statements, which reflect the Companys current beliefs and estimates with respect to future events and the Companys future financial performance, operations and competitive position. The words expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, looking ahead, forecast, plan and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. 19 The Companys continued success depends, in part, upon its ability to increase sales at existing locations, to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis. There can be no assurance that the Companys existing strategies and store expansion program will result in a continuation of revenue and profit growth. Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue and profitability remain difficult to predict. The forward looking statements that are contained in this report are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the Companys actual results to differ materially from historical results or current expectations. These factors include, without limitation, a general deterioration in economic trends, changes in geopolitical conditions, ongoing competitive pressures in the apparel industry, the Companys ability to obtain acceptable store locations, the Companys ability to continue to purchase attractive brand name merchandise at desirable discounts, the Companys ability to successfully open its distribution center in Southern California in a timely and cost effective manner, the Companys ability to successfully extend its geographic reach into new markets, unseasonable weather trends, changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences in apparel or home related merchandise, the Companys ability to attract and retain personnel with the retail talent necessary to execute its strategies, the Companys ability to implement and integrate various new systems and technologies, and greater than planned costs. In addition, the Companys corporate headquarters, one of its distribution centers and 35% of its stores are located in California. Therefore, a downturn in the California economy or a major natural disaster there could significantly affect the Companys operating results and financial condition. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risks, which primarily includes changes in interest rates. The Company does not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes. Interest that is payable on the Companys credit facilities is based on variable interest rates and is, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. In addition, lease payments under the Companys synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. Lease payments on the Southern California distribution center will begin upon completion of construction. As of February 1, 2003, the Company had $25 million of long term debt outstanding which accrues interest at LIBOR plus 150 basis points. The Company does not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates to be material. The Company does not currently use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio. 20
