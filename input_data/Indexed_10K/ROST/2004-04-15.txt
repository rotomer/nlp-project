ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview The Company is the second largest off price apparel retail company in the United States, with 568 stores in 25 states and Guam at the end of fiscal 2003. The Companys primary strategy has been a continued focus on pursuing and refining its existing off price business, and steadily expanding the number of stores and its geographic markets. In establishing growth objectives for the business, the Company closely monitors market share trends for the off price industry. According to data from the NPD Group, which provides global sales and marketing information on the retail industry, the off price share of total apparel sales in 2003 grew to 7.8% from 7.4% in 2002, reflecting the ongoing importance of value to consumers. Full priced department stores and mass merchandise retailers experienced a decline in apparel market share over the same period. The Companys strategies are designed to take advantage of these growth trends and continued customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and the home at competitive everyday discounts. In addition, the Company recently introduced a new off price concept, dds DISCOUNTSSM, to target what it believes to be an underserved but fast growing demographic lower income households. The Company believes that ultimately the United States can support a total of 1,500 Ross locations and over 500 dds DISCOUNTSSM stores for an aggregate potential of over 2,000 locations. Considering the significant expansion opportunities that remain in both existing and new markets, the Company plans to grow to over 1,000 stores by the end of fiscal 2008 and generate more than $7 billion annually in revenue by fiscal 2008. The fiscal years ended January 31, 2004, February 1, 2003, and February 2, 2002 are referred to as 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Results of Operations 2003 2002 2001 SALES Sales (millions) $ 3,921 $ 3,531 $ 2,987 Sales growth 11 % 18 % 10 % Comparable store sales growth 1 % 7 % 3 % COSTS AND EXPENSES (as a percent of sales) Cost of goods sold, including related buying, distribution and occupancy costs 74.4 % 74.4 % 75.1 % Selling, general and administrative 16.0 % 16.2 % 16.3 % Interest 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.1 % EARNINGS BEFORE TAXES 9.6 % 9.4 % 8.5 % NET EARNINGS 5.8 % 5.7 % 5.2 % Stores. Total stores open at the end of 2003, 2002 and 2001 were 568, 507 and 452, respectively. The number of stores at the end of 2003, 2002 and 2001 increased by 12%, 12% and 11%, respectively. The increased rate of growth in 2003 and 2002 compared to prior years reflected the Companys entry into new markets. The Companys operating strategy is to open additional stores in new and existing geographic markets based on market penetration, the ability to reduce overhead expenses, local demographic characteristics, competition and population density. Management continually evaluates opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations. The Company also evaluates its current store locations and determines store closures based on similar criteria. 14 2003 2002 2001 Stores at the beginning of the period 507 452 409 Stores opened in the period 66 60 45 Stores closed in the period (5 ) (5 ) (2 ) Stores at the end of the period 568 507 452 Selling square footage at the end of the period (000) 13,321 11,843 10,484 Sales. The 11% total sales increase for 2003 reflects a 1% increase in sales from comparable stores (stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months), the opening of 61 net new stores in 2003, and the full year impact of stores opened in 2002. The 18% total sales increase for 2002 reflects a 7% increase in sales from comparable stores, the opening of 55 net new stores in 2002, and the full year impact of stores opened in 2001. The 10% total sales increase for 2001 reflects a 3% increase in sales from comparable stores, the opening of 43 net new stores in 2001, and the full year impact of 2000 store openings. The Companys sales mix as shown below reflects the growth in its home businesses, which was a key contributor to comparable store sales growth in 2003, 2002 and 2001: 2003 2002 2001 Ladies 33 % 34 % 34 % Home accents and bed and bath 21 % 19 % 18 % Mens 17 % 18 % 19 % Fine jewelry, accessories, lingerie and fragrances 12 % 12 % 12 % Childrens 9 % 9 % 10 % Shoes 8 % 8 % 7 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Management expects to address the competitive climate for apparel and home goods off price retailers by pursuing and refining the Companys existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen its organization, to diversify the merchandise mix, and to more fully develop the organization and systems to strengthen regional merchandise offerings. Although the Companys existing strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales and earnings gains in 2003, 2002 and 2001, there can be no assurance that these strategies will result in a continuation of revenue and profit growth. Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales remained flat at 74.4% for both 2003 and 2002. As a percentage of sales, merchandise margin in 2003 remained flat compared to 2002. Distribution and logistics costs decreased by approximately 25 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an approximate 15 basis point reduction in distribution costs and a 10 basis point reduction in freight costs. This decrease in distribution costs as a percentage of sales in 2003 was offset by a 25 basis point increase in store occupancy costs in 2003 compared to 2002, largely attributable to reduced leverage resulting from the slower rate of comparable store sales growth over the same period in the prior year. Buying costs as a percentage of sales remained flat compared to 2002. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales decreased from 75.1% in 2001 to 74.4% in 2002, which is largely attributable to improved leverage resulting from a 7% comparable store sales increase and distribution processing efficiencies. As a percentage of sales, merchandise margin in 2002 increased by approximately 25 basis points compared to 2001. Store occupancy and depreciation as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately 25 basis points. Distribution and logistics costs as a percentage of sales in 2002 decreased by approximately 10 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year due to a 20 basis point reduction in distribution costs partially offset by a 10 basis point increase in freight costs. Buying costs in 2002 decreased by approximately 10 basis points compared to 2001 primarily due to improved leverage resulting from the 7% comparable store sales increase. 15 There can be no assurance that the gross profit margins realized in 2003, 2002 and 2001 will continue in future years. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Total selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) were $628.4 million in 2003, a $56.1 million increase from 2002. During 2003, SG&A as a percentage of sales declined approximately 20 basis points. This decrease was primarily due to a 30 basis point decrease in benefit related costs which were partially offset by a 10 basis point increase in depreciation costs. Store operating costs as a percentage of sales remained flat in 2003 compared to 2002. Total SG&A was $572.3 million in 2002, an $86.9 million increase from 2001. During 2002, SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased slightly due primarily to higher leverage on store payroll, benefit costs and operating costs, partially offset by an increase in incentive compensation costs. Store operating costs as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately 20 basis points from 2001, due primarily to improved leverage resulting from a 7% comparable store sales increase. General and administrative costs as a percentage of sales grew by approximately 15 basis points in 2002 due mainly to an increase in incentive compensation costs, partially offset by improved leverage. The largest component of SG&A is payroll. The total number of employees, including both full and part time, at January 31, 2004, February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002 was approximately 26,600, 22,500 and 21,000, respectively. Interest. Interest expense and interest income as a percentage of sales in 2003 was relatively flat compared to the prior year. The table below reflects interest income and expense for 2003, 2002 and 2001: ($ millions) 2003 2002 2001 Interest expense $ 1.4 $ 1.5 $ 4.5 Interest income (1.7 ) (1.2 ) (1.3 ) Total interest expense (income), net $ (.3 ) $ .3 $ 3.2 Taxes on Earnings. The Companys effective tax rate for 2003, 2002 and 2001 was approximately 39%, which represents the applicable Federal and State statutory rates reduced by the Federal benefit received for State taxes. During 2004, the Company expects its effective tax rate to remain at approximately 39%. Net Earnings. The increase in net earnings as a percentage of sales in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales. The increase in net earnings as a percentage of sales in 2002 as compared to 2001 was primarily due to improved leverage realized from the increase in comparable store sales growth on store expenses and on buying, distribution, occupancy, and depreciation costs in 2002 when compared to 2001, combined with slightly higher merchandise margins, which was partially offset by higher incentive compensation costs. Diluted earnings per share in 2003 increased by 17% to $1.47 from $1.26 in 2002. This increase is attributable to an approximate 13% increase in net earnings and 3% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 16 Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources. The Companys primary sources of funds for its business activities are cash flows from operations and short term trade credit. The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements are for seasonal and new store inventory purchases and capital expenditures in connection with new stores, relocations, and investments in information systems and infrastructure. The Company also uses cash to repurchase stock under its stock repurchase program and to pay dividends. ($000) 2003 2002 2001 Cash flows from Operating activities $ 315,306 $ 349,029 $ 254,964 Cash flows used in Investing activities (146,529 ) (133,166 ) (86,002 ) Cash flows used in Financing activities (117,880 ) (105,565 ) (165,765 ) Net increase in cash and cash equivalents $ 50,897 $ 110,298 $ 3,197 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $315.3 million, $349.0 million and $255.0 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The primary source of cash from operations in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was net earnings plus non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization, partially offset by cash used to finance merchandise inventory. The decrease in cash flows from operations in 2003 is primarily due to a reduction of accounts payable leverage (defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory) from 55% at February 1, 2003 to 53% at January 31, 2004. Working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) was $409 million at the end of 2003, compared to $312 million at the end of 2002, and $233 million at the end of 2001. The Companys primary source of liquidity is the sale of its merchandise inventory. Management regularly reviews the age and condition of the merchandise and is able to maintain current inventory in its stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slower moving merchandise through clearance markdowns. Investing Activities In 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company spent approximately $146.5 million, $133.2 million and $86.0 million, respectively, for capital expenditures (net of leased equipment) for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new stores, implement management information systems, implement materials handling equipment and related distribution center systems and various other expenditures related to existing stores, buying and corporate offices. The Company opened 66, 60 and 45 new stores and relocated, remodeled or expanded 1, 1 and 14 stores in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The Company is forecasting approximately $135 million in capital expenditures for fiscal 2004 to fund fixtures and leasehold improvements to open 70 net new Ross stores and the initial ten dds DISCOUNTSSM stores. In addition, these capital expenditures are expected to cover the relocation, or remodel of existing stores, and investments in store and merchandising systems, distribution center equipment and systems and various central office expenditures. The Company expects to fund these expenditures out of cash flows from operations. 17 The Companys cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three years as set forth in the table below: ($ millions) 2003 2002 2001 New stores $ 44.9 $ 37.7 $ 34.9 Store renovations and improvements 15.1 43.3 29.9 Information systems, distribution centers and corporate office 86.5 52.2 21.2 Total capital expenditures $ 146.5 $ 133.2 $ 86.0 Financing Activities During 2003, 2002 and 2001, liquidity and capital requirements were provided by cash flows from operations, bank credit facilities and trade credit. Substantially all of the Companys store sites, certain distribution centers and buying offices are leased and, except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment, do not represent long term capital investments. The Company owns its current corporate headquarters and distribution center in Newark, California, and its distribution center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The Company repurchased 6.9 million and 7.6 million shares of common stock in fiscal year 2003 and 2002, respectively. The Company repurchased $150 million each year in 2003 and 2002 under the stock repurchase programs funded by cash flows from operations. The Company repurchased 9.8 million shares of common stock for $131 million in fiscal year 2001. Short term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for investments in merchandise inventory. Trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with the Companys vendors. Management regularly reviews the adequacy of credit available to the Company from all sources and has been able to maintain adequate lines to meet the capital and liquidity requirements of the Company. The table below presents significant contractual payment obligations of the Company at January 31, 2004. ($000) Contractual Obligations Less than 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Total Long term debt $ $ 50,000 $ $ $ 50,000 Operating leases 213,208 375,524 303,034 408,589 1,300,355 Other financings: Synthetic leases 10,454 14,163 8,176 18,737 51,530 Other synthetic lease obligations 87,519 56,000 143,519 Purchase obligations 570,103 8,915 4,534 583,552 Total contractual obligations $ 793,765 $ 536,121 $ 315,744 $ 483,326 $ 2,128,956 Long Term Debt. In June 2002, the Company entered into a $50 million senior unsecured term loan agreement to finance the equipment and information systems for the new Southern California distribution center. The Company borrowed $25 million under this term loan in September 2002 and made the final draw of $25 million under this term loan in February 2003. Interest is payable no less than quarterly at the banks applicable prime rate or at LIBOR plus an applicable margin (currently 150 basis points) which 18 resulted in an effective interest rate of 2.7% at January 31, 2004. All amounts outstanding under the term loan will be due and payable in December 2006. Borrowings under this term loan are subject to certain operating and financial covenants including maintaining certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Operating Leases. Substantially all of the Companys store sites, buying offices and certain distribution centers are leased. The Company owns its distribution center and corporate headquarters in Newark, California, and its distribution center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. In July 2003, the Company entered into an arrangement to lease certain equipment in its stores for its new POS systems. This lease is accounted for as an operating lease for financial reporting purposes. The initial term of this lease is two years and the Company has options to renew the lease for three one year periods. Alternatively, the Company may purchase or return the equipment at the end of the initial or each renewal term. The Company has guaranteed the value of the equipment at the end of the initial lease term and each renewal period, if exercised, at amounts not to exceed 57%, 43%, 27% and 10%, respectively, of the equipments estimated initial fair market value of $24 million. The Companys obligation under the residual value guarantee at the end of the original lease term of 57% of the equipments initial fair value, or $13.3 million, is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the table above. In January 2004, the Company commenced its lease on its new corporate headquarters in Pleasanton, California. The lease has an initial term of 10.5 years with three five year renewal options. The Company plans to occupy the space starting in the second quarter of 2004. Other Financings. The Company leases a 1.3 million square foot distribution center in Fort Mill, South Carolina, which was completed in July 2002. This distribution center, including equipment and systems, is being financed under an $87.3 million, five year operating lease, commonly referred to as a synthetic lease, which expires in May 2006. Monthly rent expense is currently payable at 75 basis points over 30 day LIBOR on the lease balance of $87.3 million. At the end of the lease term, the Company must refinance the $87.3 million synthetic lease facility, purchase the distribution center at the amount of the lease balance, or arrange a sale of the distribution center to a third party. The Company has agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor up to 85% of the lease balance. The Companys obligation under this residual value guarantee of $74.2 million is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the table above. In July 2003, the Company refinanced its existing five year operating lease, commonly referred to as a synthetic lease, for its Southern California distribution center with a new ten year synthetic lease facility that expires in July 2013. Rent expense on this center is payable monthly at a fixed annual rate of 5.8% on the lease balance of $70 million. At the end of the lease term, the Company must refinance the $70 million synthetic lease facility, purchase the distribution center at the amount of the then outstanding lease balance, or arrange a sale of the distribution center to a third party. If the distribution center is sold to a third party for less than $70 million, the Company has agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor the shortfall below $70 million not to exceed $56 million. The Companys contractual obligation of $56 million is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the above table. The equipment and systems for the Southern California center were financed with a $50 million, five year senior unsecured term debt facility, which is included in Long term debt in the table above. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, the Company has recognized a liability and corresponding asset for the fair value of the residual value guarantee in the amount of $8.3 million for the Southern California distribution center and $1.5 million for the POS lease. These residual value guarantees are being amortized on a straight line basis over the original terms of the leases. The current portion of the related asset and liability is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other and Accrued expenses and other, respectively, and the long term portion of the related assets and liabilities is recorded in Other long term assets and Other long term liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company leases two separate warehouse facilities in Carlisle, Pennsylvania with operating leases expiring through 2011. In January 2004, the Company entered into a two year lease with two one year options for a warehouse facility in Fort Mill, South Carolina. These three leased facilities are being used primarily to store packaway merchandise. 19 The two synthetic lease facilities described above, as well as the Companys long term debt and revolving credit facility, have covenant restrictions requiring the Company to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. In addition, the interest rates under these agreements may vary depending on the Companys actual interest coverage ratios. As of January 31, 2004, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. In December 2003, the FASB issued the revised FIN No. 46(R),Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of entities that are not controllable through voting interests or in which the equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks and rewards. FIN No. 46(R) explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise should assess its interest in an entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. The Company was not required under FIN No. 46(R) to consolidate its $87 million synthetic lease facility for its South Carolina distribution center and its $70 million synthetic lease facility for its Southern California distribution center because the lessors/owners of these distribution centers are not variable interest entities. See discussion under New Accounting Pronouncements. Purchase Obligations. As of January 31, 2004, the Company had purchase obligations of $583.6 million. These purchase obligations primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to store fixtures, supplies, and information technology service and maintenance contracts. Total merchandise inventory purchase orders of $555.4 million are all purchase obligations of less than one year. In the course of working with the Companys vendors, a portion of the amount shown as purchase obligations may be cancelable without penalty. Commercial Credit Facilities The table below presents significant commercial credit facilities available to the Company at January 31, 2004. ($000) Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Total Amount Committed Commercial Credit Commitments Less than 1 Year 2 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Revolving credit facility1 $ 350,000 $ $ $ $ 350,000 Standby letters of credit, excluding those issued under the revolving facility 50,600 50,600 Total commercial commitments $ 400,600 $ $ $ $ 400,600 1 Contains a $75 million sublimit for issuances of letters of credit, of which $16.8 million is outstanding and $58.2 million is available as of January 31, 2004. For additional information relating to these credit facilities, refer to Note B of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revolving Credit Facility. At January 31, 2004, the Company had a $350 million revolving credit facility with its banks, which contains a $75 million sublimit for issuances of letters of credit of which $58.2 million was available. Interest is LIBOR based plus an applicable margin (currently 87.5 basis points) and is payable upon borrowing maturity but no less than quarterly. Borrowing under this credit facility is subject to the Company maintaining certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of January 31, 2004, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. This existing revolving credit facility is scheduled to expire in August 2004. In March 2004, the Company obtained a new five year $600 million revolving credit facility with its banks, which contains a $200 million sublimit for issuances of letters of credit and expires in March 2009. Interest 20 is LIBOR based plus an applicable margin (currently 75 basis points). All other terms of this agreement are substantially the same as the prior revolving credit agreement. Standby Letters of Credit. The Company uses standby letters of credit to collateralize certain obligations related to its self insured workers compensation and general liability claims. The Company had $67.4 million and $74.3 million in standby letters of credit outstanding at January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003, respectively. Trade Letters of Credit. The Company had $15.4 million and $14.3 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003, respectively. Dividends. In January 2004, a quarterly cash dividend payment of $.0425 per common share was declared by the Companys Board of Directors, payable on or about April 1, 2004. The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $.0288 per common share in January, May, August and November 2003 and $.0238 per common share in January, May, August and November 2002. Stock Repurchase Program. On January 28, 2004, the Companys Board of Directors approved a new two year $350 million stock repurchase program for 2004 and 2005. The Company repurchased a total of $150 million of common stock each year in 2003 and 2002. The Company repurchased a total of $131 million of common stock during 2001 under a prior program. The Company estimates that cash flows from operations, existing bank credit lines and trade credit are adequate to meet operating cash needs, fund its planned capital investments, repurchase common stock and make quarterly dividend payments for at least the next twelve months. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2003, the FASB issued the revised FIN No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of entities that are not controllable through voting interests or in which the equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks and rewards. FIN No. 46(R) explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise should assess its interest in an entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. The Company was not required under FIN No. 46(R) to consolidate its $87 million synthetic lease facility for its South Carolina distribution center and its $70 million synthetic lease facility for its Southern California distribution center because the lessors/owners of these distribution centers are not variable interest entities. In April 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 149 amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts, and for hedging activities under Statement 133. SFAS No. 149 is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003 and for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003. The guidance should be applied prospectively. The adoption of SFAS No. 149 had no impact on the Companys operating results or financial position. Relocation of West Coast Distribution Center and Corporate Headquarters In September 2003, the Company opened its new 1.3 million square foot distribution center in Perris, California. During the third and fourth quarters of 2003, the Company transitioned its West Coast distribution operations from its Newark, California facility to the new Perris, California facility. The Company continues to use the office space attached to the Newark facility as its corporate headquarters and plans to relocate its corporate headquarters to Pleasanton, California in July 2004. The Company is currently evaluating ongoing uses for or the potential sale of its Newark, California headquarters and distribution center once the facility is fully vacated following the planned corporate office relocation. The Company is in the process of looking at alternative uses for the facility and obtaining independent, third party valuations of the Newark facility. The Company expects to complete this evaluation process in the first half of 2004. The commercial real estate market in the San Francisco Bay Area is currently depressed. Depending on the Companys decision as to future use or disposition of the Newark 21 facility, a significant write down to adjust the facilitys net book value, which is approximately $35 million, to its current fair market value may be required. dds DISCOUNTSSM During 2003, the Company announced the development of dds DISCOUNTSSM, a new off price concept targeted to serve the needs of lower income households, which it believes to be one of the fastest growing demographic markets in the country. This new business will generally have similar merchandise departments and categories to that of Ross, but will feature a different mix of brands, consisting mostly of moderate and discount store labels at lower average price points. The Company plans to open ten initial dds DISCOUNTSSM locations on the West Coast during the second half of 2004. The dds DISCOUNTSSM store prototype is planned to be about 25,000 gross square feet located in established strip shopping centers in densely populated urban and suburban neighborhoods. The dds DISCOUNTSSM and Ross merchant and store organizations will be separate and distinct; however, dds DISCOUNTSSM will share certain corporate and support services with Ross. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements requires management of the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. The estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: Inventory. The Companys merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost method. The Company purchases manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as packaway inventory. Packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in the Companys warehouses until a later date, which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year. Included in the carrying value of the Companys inventory is a provision for shrinkage. The shrinkage reserve is based on historical shrinkage rates as evaluated through the Companys physical inventory counts and cycle counts. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, or if sales of the inventory are more difficult than anticipated, additional inventory write downs may be required. Long lived Assets. The Company records a long lived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. An impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group. In the course of performing this analysis, management determined that no long lived asset impairment charge was required for years ended January 31, 2004, February 1, 2003 and February 2, 2002. Should actual results differ materially from projected results, an impairment charge may be required in the future. Self Insurance. The Company self insures certain of its workers compensation and general liability risks as well as certain of its health insurance plans. The Companys self insurance liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care and state statutory requirements increase beyond what was anticipated, reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required. The above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the Companys accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, with no need for managements judgment in their application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. See the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles. 22 Forward Looking Statements and Factors Affecting Future Performance This report includes certain forward looking statements, which reflect the Companys current beliefs and estimates with respect to future events and the Companys future financial performance, operations and competitive position. The words expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, looking ahead, forecast, plan, projected, and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. The Companys continued success depends, in part, upon its ability to increase sales at existing locations, to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis. There can be no assurance that the Companys existing strategies and store expansion program will result in a continuation of revenue and profit growth. Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue and profitability remain difficult to predict. The forward looking statements that are contained in this report are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the Companys actual results to differ materially from historical results or current expectations. These risk factors apply to both Ross and dds DISCOUNTSSM stores and include, without limitation, a general deterioration in economic trends, changes in geopolitical conditions, ongoing competitive pressures in the apparel industry, the Companys ability to obtain acceptable store locations, the Companys ability to continue to purchase attractive brand name merchandise at desirable discounts, the Companys ability to operate its distribution network at targeted levels of productivity, the Companys ability to successfully extend its geographic reach into new markets, unseasonable weather trends, changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences in apparel or home related merchandise, the Companys ability to attract and retain personnel with the retail talent necessary to execute its strategies, the Companys ability to implement and integrate various new systems and technologies, and greater than planned costs. In addition, the Company is evaluating whether it will incur a potential non cash, non recurring charge to write down the value of the Companys Newark headquarters and distribution center to current fair market value. Additionally, the anticipated relaxation of trade restrictions with China in January 2005 may affect the Companys buying strategies and price points. In addition, the Companys corporate headquarters, certain of its distribution centers and 32% of its stores are located in California. Therefore, a downturn in the California economy or a major California natural disaster could significantly affect the Companys operating results and financial condition. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risks, which primarily include changes in interest rates. The Company does not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes. Interest that is payable on the Companys revolving credit facilities and long term debt is based on variable interest rates and is, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. In addition, lease payments under certain of the Companys synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. As of January 31, 2004, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facilities and had $50 million of long term debt outstanding which accrues interest at LIBOR plus 150 basis points. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as of and for the year ended January 31, 2004. The Company does not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates to be material. The Company does not currently use derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio. 23
