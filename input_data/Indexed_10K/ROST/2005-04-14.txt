ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Restatement of Consolidated Financial Statements On February 7, 2005, the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a letter to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating lease accounting issues and their treatment under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). In response to this letter, the Company initiated a review of its lease related accounting and determined that the Companys method of accounting for landlord incentives or allowances under operating leases (tenant improvement allowances) and the Companys method of accounting for rent holidays were not consistent with this guidance. The Company historically accounted for tenant improvement allowances as reductions of fixed assets on the consolidated balance sheets and as reductions of capital expenditures in investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company historically amortized leasehold improvements over the original lease term, typically 10 years. The Company determined that the appropriate interpretation of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Technical Bulletin No. 881, Issues Relating to Accounting for Leases, requires these allowances to be recorded as deferred rent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets, amortized over the lease term, and included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company historically amortized rent holiday periods on a straightline basis over the lease term based on the store opening date, which excluded the build out period for its stores from the term over which it expensed rent. The Company considered FASB Technical Bulletin No. 853, Accounting for Operating Leases with Scheduled Rent Increases, and determined that the lease term should commence on the date the Company takes possession of the leased space for construction purposes, which is generally one to four months prior to the opening date. In addition, the Company historically capitalized rent during the construction period for its distribution and headquarter facilities. The Company considered interpretive guidance based on analogies to FASB Statement No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost, and FASB Statement No. 67, Accounting for the Costs and Initial Rental Operations of Real Estate Projects regarding capitalization of rent during the period of time a lessee is performing construction activities. The Company concluded that its historical policy of capitalizing rent during the build out period is appropriate and has corrected its accounting to apply the policy to the build out period for all facilities, including its stores. As a result, the Company restated the consolidated financial statements for its fiscal years 2003 and 2002. The corrections are summarized in Note B to the consolidated financial statements included in this report at Part II, Item 8. The accompanying Managements Discussion and Analysis gives effect to these restatement adjustments. Overview The Company is the second largest off price apparel retail company in the United States, with 639 Ross stores and ten dds DISCOUNTSSM store locations in 26 states and Guam at the end of fiscal 2004. The Companys primary strategy has been a continued focus on pursuing and refining its existing off price business, and steadily expanding the number of stores and its geographic markets. In establishing growth objectives for the business, the Company closely monitors market share trends for the off price industry. According to data from the NPD Group, which provides global sales and marketing information on the retail industry, the off price share of total apparel sales in 2004 grew to 8.5% from 7.6% in 2003, reflecting the ongoing importance of value to consumers. Full priced department stores and mass merchandise retailers experienced a decline in apparel market share over the same period. The Companys strategies are designed to take advantage of these growth trends and continued customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and the home at competitive everyday discounts. 16 In 2004, the Company opened its first ten dds DISCOUNTSSM stores, a new off price concept targeting what it believes to be an underserved but fast growing demographic lower income households. The Company believes that ultimately the United States can support a total of 1,500 Ross locations and over 500 dds DISCOUNTSSM stores for an aggregate potential of over 2,000 locations. The fiscal years ended January 29, 2005, January 31, 2004, and February 1, 2003 are referred to as 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Results of Operations 2004 2003 2002 SALES Sales (millions) $ 4,240 $ 3,921 $ 3,531 Sales growth 8 % 11 % 18 % Change in comparable store sales growth (1 )% 1 % 7 % COSTS AND EXPENSES (as a percent of sales) Cost of goods sold, including related buying, distribution and occupancy costs 77.3 % 74.5 % 74.5 % Selling, general and administrative 15.7 % 16.0 % 16.2 % Impairment of long lived assets 0.4 % 0.0 % 0.0 % Interest 0.0 % 0.0 % 0.0 % EARNINGS BEFORE TAXES 6.6 % 9.5 % 9.3 % NET EARNINGS 4.0 % 5.8 % 5.7 % Stores. Total stores open at the end of 2004, 2003 and 2002 were 649, 568 and 507, respectively. The number of stores at the end of 2004, 2003 and 2002 increased by 14%, 12% and 12% from the prior fiscal year, respectively. The increased rate of growth in 2004 compared to prior years reflected the Companys launch of its new concept dds DISCOUNTSSM with ten initial stores. The Companys operating strategy is to open additional stores in new and existing geographic markets based on market penetration, the ability to reduce overhead expenses, local demographic characteristics, competition and population density. Management continually evaluates opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations. The Company also evaluates its current store locations and determines store closures based on similar criteria. 2004 2003 2002 Stores at the beginning of the period 568 507 452 Stores opened in the period 84 66 60 Stores closed in the period (3 ) (5 ) (5 ) Stores at the end of the period 649 568 507 Selling square footage at the end of the period (000) 15,253 13,321 11,843 Sales. Sales increased $319.4 million, or 8%, compared to the same period in the prior year due to the opening of 81 net new stores during 2004, and the impact of the stores opened in 2003, partially offset by a 1% decrease in sales from comparable stores (defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months). Sales increased $389.2 million, or 11%, for 2003 compared to the same period in the prior year due to a 1% increase in sales from comparable stores, the opening of 61 net new stores in 2003, and the full year impact of stores opened in 2002. Sales increased $544.8 million, or 18%, for 2002 compared to the prior year due to a 7% increase in sales from comparable stores, the opening of 55 net new stores in 2002, and the full year impact of 2001 store openings. 17 The Companys sales mix is shown below for 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 Ladies 34 % 33 % 34 % Home accents and bed and bath 21 % 21 % 19 % Mens 16 % 17 % 18 % Fine jewelry, accessories, lingerie and fragrances 12 % 12 % 12 % Childrens 9 % 9 % 9 % Shoes 8 % 8 % 8 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % Management expects to address the competitive climate for apparel and home goods off price retailers by pursuing and refining the Companys existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen its organization, to diversify the merchandise mix, and to more fully develop the organization and systems to strengthen regional merchandise offerings. Although the Companys existing strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in 2004, 2003 and 2002, there can be no assurance that these strategies will result in a continuation of revenue growth or profit growth. During April 2004, the Company installed a new Core Merchandising System, which is a computer based information system that over time is expected to improve the Companys ability to plan, buy and allocate merchandise more precisely. Subsequent to the installation of the new merchandising system, the Company experienced difficulties in generating the necessary merchandising related information utilized by its merchants and allocators. Although the Company is unable to quantify the impact, it believes the Core Merchandising System problems had an adverse effect on 2004 sales and earnings. The Company believes that these merchant reporting issues were essentially remedied by the end of fiscal year 2004. Cost of Goods Sold. Cost of goods sold in 2004 increased $361.1 million compared to the same period in the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 81 net new stores during the year, the impact of the stores opened in 2003, higher markdowns and increased distribution and logistics costs. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for the year increased approximately 290 basis points compared with the same period in the prior year. This increase is largely attributable to higher distribution and logistics costs, lower merchandise gross margin largely due to higher markdowns and reduced leverage resulting from the 1% decrease in comparable store sales which contributed to higher occupancy and buying expenses as a percentage of sales, and buying costs related to the launch of dds DISCOUNTSSM. Distribution and logistics costs as a percentage of sales increased by approximately 130 basis points due mainly to lower productivity and higher payroll expenses associated with new distribution center systems and higher off site storage costs. Higher markdowns and lower initial mark ups contributed to an approximate 100 basis point increase in merchandise cost of goods sold. In addition, store occupancy costs as a percentage of sales increased by approximately 35 basis points. Buying costs as a percentage of sales increased by approximately 25 basis points compared to the prior year. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales remained flat at 74.5% for both 2003 and 2002. As a percentage of sales, merchandise margin in 2003 remained flat compared to 2002. Distribution and logistics costs decreased by approximately 25 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to an approximate 15 basis point reduction in distribution costs and a 10 basis point reduction in freight costs. This decrease in distribution costs as a percentage of sales in 2003 was offset by a 25 basis point increase in store occupancy and buying related costs in 2003 compared to 2002, largely attributable to reduced leverage resulting from the slower rate of comparable store sales growth over the same period in the prior year. Buying costs as a percentage of sales remained flat compared to 2002. There can be no assurance that the gross profit margins realized in 2004, 2003 and 2002 will continue in future years. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. For 2004, selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased $36.0 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 81 net new stores during the period, partially offset by lower incentive plan costs. 18 SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately 35 basis points, primarily due to an approximate 55 basis point decrease in incentive plan costs partially offset by a 20 basis point increase in store payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of sales. Total SG&A were $628.4 million in 2003, a $56.0 million increase from 2002. During 2003, SG&A as a percentage of sales declined approximately 20 basis points. This decrease was primarily due to a 30 basis point decrease in benefit related costs which were partially offset by a 10 basis point increase in depreciation costs. Store operating costs as a percentage of sales remained flat in 2003 compared to 2002. The largest component of SG&A is payroll. The total number of employees, including both full and part time, at January 29, 2005, January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003 was approximately 30,100, 26,600 and 22,500, respectively. Interest. Interest expense in 2004 increased $1.6 million and interest income increased $0.4 million compared to the prior year. As a percentage of sales, interest expense and interest income in 2004 remained relatively flat compared to the prior year. The table below reflects interest income and expense for 2004, 2003 and 2002: ($ millions) 2004 2003 2002 Interest expense $ 3.0 $ 1.4 $ 1.5 Interest income (2.1 ) (1.7 ) (1.2 ) Total interest expense (income), net $ .9 $ (.3 ) $ .3 Impairment of Long Lived Assets. During the second quarter of 2004, the Company relocated its corporate headquarters from Newark, California to Pleasanton, California and decided to pursue a sale of its Newark Facility. The Company recognized an impairment charge of $18 million before taxes in the second quarter 2004 to write down the carrying value of its Newark Facility from its net book value of approximately $33 million to the estimated fair value at the time of approximately $15 million. During the third quarter, the Company sold the Newark Facility for net proceeds of approximately $17 million. The Company recognized a gain (reduction in impairment loss) of approximately $2 million before taxes in the third quarter 2004 on the sale of its Newark Facility. For the year ended January 29, 2005, the net impairment charge recognized by the Company was approximately $16 million before taxes. Taxes on Earnings. The Companys effective tax rate for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was approximately 39%, which represents the applicable Federal and State statutory rates reduced by the Federal benefit received for State taxes. The effective rate is impacted by changes in law, location of new stores, level of earnings and the result of tax audits. Net Earnings. The decrease in net earnings as a percentage of sales in 2004 as compared to 2003 was primarily due to higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales. The increase in net earnings as a percentage of sales in 2003 as compared to 2002 was primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales. Diluted earnings per share in 2004 was $1.13, inclusive of the $.06 write down related to the Companys former corporate office and distribution center and $.01 related to the lease accounting adjustments, compared to $1.47 in 2003. This decrease is attributable to an approximate 25% decrease in net earnings, partially offset by a 3% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding. 19 Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources The Companys primary sources of funds for its business activities are cash flows from operations and short term trade credit. The Companys primary ongoing cash requirements are for seasonal and new store merchandise inventory purchases and capital expenditures in connection with new stores, relocations, and investments in information systems and infrastructure. The Company also uses cash to repurchase stock under its stock repurchase program and to pay dividends. ($000) 2004 2003 2002 Cash flows from Operating activities $ 298,157 $ 321,471 $ 354,715 Cash flows used in Investing activities (199,541 ) (152,694 ) (138,852 ) Cash flows used in Financing activities (184,831 ) (117,880 ) (105,565 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ (86,215 ) $ 50,897 $ 110,298 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $298.2 million, $321.5 million and $354.7 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The primary source of cash from operations in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was net earnings plus non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization, partially offset by cash used to finance merchandise inventory. The decrease in cash flows from operations in 2004 is primarily due to lower net earnings, which is partially offset by the change in cash used for merchandise inventory. Working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) was $411 million at the end of 2004, compared to $410 million at the end of 2003, and $314 million at the end of 2002. The Companys primary source of liquidity is the sale of its merchandise inventory. Management regularly reviews the age and condition of the merchandise and is able to maintain current merchandise inventory in its stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slower moving merchandise through clearance markdowns. Investing Activities In 2004, 2003 and 2002, the Company spent approximately $149.5 million, $152.7 million and $138.9 million, respectively, for capital expenditures (excluding leased equipment) for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new stores, implement management information systems, implement materials handling equipment and related distribution center systems and various other expenditures related to existing stores, buying and corporate offices. The Company opened 84, 66 and 60 new stores and relocated, remodeled or expanded 3, 1 and 1 stores in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In addition, during the year ended January 29, 2005, the Company received approximately $17 million in net proceeds from the sale of the Newark Facility and invested $67.4 million in short term investments. The Company is forecasting approximately $185 million in capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 to fund fixtures and leasehold improvements to open both new Ross stores and dds DISCOUNTSSM stores. In addition, these capital expenditures are expected to cover the relocation, or remodel of existing stores, and investments in store and merchandising systems, distribution center equipment and systems, and various central office expenditures. The Company expects to fund these expenditures out of cash flows from operations, and bank and credit facilities. 20 The Companys cash flows for investing activities include capital expenditures for the last three years as set forth in the table below: ($ millions) 2004 2003 2002 New stores $ 58.7 $ 51.1 $ 43.4 Store renovations and improvements 25.5 15.1 43.3 Information systems 37.0 34.7 28.9 Distribution centers, corporate office and other 28.3 51.8 23.3 Total capital expenditures $ 149.5 $ 152.7 $ 138.9 Financing Activities During 2004, 2003 and 2002, liquidity and capital requirements were provided by cash flows from operations, bank credit facilities and trade credit. Substantially all of the Companys store sites, certain distribution centers and buying offices are leased and, except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment, do not represent long term capital investments. The Company owns its distribution center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The Company repurchased 6.5 million, 6.9 million and 7.6 million shares of common stock for $175 million, $150 million and $150 million in fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, under the stock repurchase programs funded by cash flows from operations. Short term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for investments in merchandise inventory. Trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with the Companys vendors. Management regularly reviews the adequacy of credit available to the Company from all sources and has been able to maintain adequate lines to meet the capital and liquidity requirements of the Company. The table below presents significant contractual payment obligations of the Company at January 29, 2005. ($000) Contractual Obligations Less than 1 Year 1 3Years 4 5Years After 5Years Total Long term debt $ 1,969 $ 51,805 $ $ $ 53,774 Operating leases 216,489 384,854 303,247 359,663 1,264,253 Other financings: Synthetic leases 11,421 9,616 8,182 14,318 43,537 Other synthetic lease obligations 15,678 82,335 56,000 154,013 Purchase obligations 589,081 9,300 2,223 600,604 Total contractual obligations $ 834,638 $ 537,910 $ 313,652 $ 429,981 $ 2,116,181 Long Term Debt. The Company has a $50 million senior unsecured term loan agreement to finance the equipment and information systems for its Southern California distribution center. Total borrowings under the term loan were $50 million as of January 29, 2005. The Company has estimated interest on long term debt of $3.8 million during the term of the loan, which is calculated based upon prevailing interest rates (LIBOR plus 150 basis points) and is included in Long term debt in the table above. Interest is payable no 21 less than quarterly at the banks applicable prime rate or at LIBOR plus an applicable margin (currently 150 basis points) which resulted in an effective interest rate of 3.9% at January 29, 2005. All amounts outstanding under the term loan will be due and payable in December 2006. Borrowings under this term loan are subject to certain operating and financial covenants including maintaining certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Operating Leases. Substantially all of the Companys store sites, certain distribution centers, and the Companys buying offices and new corporate headquarters are leased and, except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment, do not represent long term capital investments. The Company owns its distribution center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment in its stores for its point of sale (POS) hardware and software systems. These leases are accounted for as operating leases for financial reporting purposes. The initial terms of these leases are two years and the Company typically has options to renew the leases for two to three one year periods respectively. Alternatively, the Company may purchase or return the equipment at the end of the initial or each renewal term. The Company has guaranteed the value of the equipment at the end of the respective initial lease terms of $15.7 million, which is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the table above. In January 2004, the Company commenced its lease on its new corporate headquarters in Pleasanton, California. The lease has an initial term of 10.5 years with three five year renewal options. In October 2004, the Company entered into a lease arrangement to use a portion of the Newark Facility to support distribution activities for dds DISCOUNTSSM for an initial lease term of two years with three one year renewal options, a minor part of its remaining useful life. The Company also entered into a six month lease arrangement to use a portion of the Newark Facility for the Companys data center. Other Financings. The Company leases a 1.3 million square foot distribution center in Fort Mill, South Carolina. This distribution center, including equipment and systems, is being financed under an $87.3 million, five year operating lease, commonly referred to as a synthetic lease, which expires in May 2006. Monthly rent expense is currently payable at 90 basis points over 30 day LIBOR on the lease balance of $87.3 million. The Company has estimated rent expense on the lease which is calculated based upon prevailing interest rates (LIBOR plus 90 basis points) and is included in Synthetic leases in the contractual obligations table above. At the end of the lease term, the Company must refinance the $87.3 million synthetic lease facility, purchase the distribution center at the amount of the then outstanding lease balance, or arrange a sale of the distribution center to a third party. The Company has agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor up to 85% of the lease balance. The Companys obligation under this residual value guarantee of $74.2 million is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the contractual obligations table above. In July 2003, the Company refinanced its existing five year operating lease, commonly referred to as a synthetic lease, for its Southern California distribution center with a new ten year synthetic lease facility that expires in July 2013. Rent expense on this center is payable monthly at a fixed annual rate of 5.8% on the lease balance of $70 million. At the end of the lease term, the Company must refinance the $70 million synthetic lease facility, purchase the distribution center at the amount of the then outstanding lease balance, or arrange a sale of the distribution center to a third party. If the distribution center is sold to a third party for less than $70 million, the Company has agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor the shortfall below $70 million not to exceed $56 million. The Companys contractual obligation of $56 million is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the above table. The equipment and systems for the Southern California center were financed with a $50 million, five year senior unsecured term debt facility, which is included in Long term debt in the table above. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, the Company has recognized a liability and corresponding asset for the fair value of the residual value guarantee in the amount of $8.3 million for the Southern California distribution center and $1.5 million for the POS lease. These residual value guarantees are being amortized on a straight line 22 basis over the original terms of the leases. The current portion of the related asset and liability is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other and Accrued expenses and other, respectively, and the long term portion of the related assets and liabilities is recorded in Other long term assets and Other long term liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In addition, the Company leases two separate warehouse facilities for packaway storage in Carlisle, Pennsylvania with operating leases expiring through 2011. In January 2004, the Company entered into a two year lease with two one year options for a warehouse facility in Fort Mill, South Carolina. These three leased facilities are being used primarily to store packaway merchandise. The synthetic lease facilities described above, as well as the Companys long term debt and revolving credit facility, have covenant restrictions requiring the Company to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. In addition, the interest rates under these agreements may vary depending on the Companys actual interest coverage ratios. As of January 29, 2005, the Company was in compliance with these covenants. In December 2003, the FASB issued the revised FIN No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of entities that are not controllable through voting interests or in which the equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks and rewards. FIN No. 46(R) explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise should assess its interest in an entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. The Company was not required under FIN No. 46(R) to consolidate its synthetic leases since the lessors/owners are not variable interest entities. Purchase Obligations. As of January 29, 2005 the Company had purchase obligations of $600.6 million. These purchase obligations primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to store fixtures, supplies, and information technology service and maintenance contracts. Total merchandise inventory purchase orders of $554.0 million are all purchase obligations of less than one year as of January 29, 2005. Commercial Credit Facilities The table below presents significant commercial credit facilities available to the Company at January 29, 2005. Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Total Amount Committed ($000) Commercial Credit Commitments Less than 1 Year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Revolving credit facility1 $ $ $ 600,000 $ $ 600,000 Total commercial commitments $ $ $ 600,000 $ $ 600,000 1 Contains a $200 million sublimit for issuances of letters of credit, of which $65.8 million is outstanding and $134.2 million is available as of January 29, 2005. For additional information relating to these credit facilities, refer to Note C of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revolving Credit Facility. During the quarter ended May 1, 2004, the Company entered into a $600 million revolving credit facility with its banks, which contains a $200 million sublimit for issuances of letters of credit of which $134.2 million was available at January 29, 2005. Interest is LIBOR based plus an applicable margin (currently 75 basis points) and is payable upon borrowing maturity but no less than quarterly. Borrowing under this credit facility is subject to the Company maintaining certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of January 29, 2005, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under this facility. This existing revolving credit facility is scheduled to expire in March 2009. 23 Standby Letters of Credit. The Company uses standby letters of credit to collateralize certain obligations related to its self insured workers compensation and general liability claims. The Company had $65.8 million and $67.4 million in standby letters of credit outstanding at January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004, respectively. Trade Letters of Credit. The Company had $17.0 million and $15.4 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004, respectively. Dividends. In January 2005, a quarterly cash dividend payment of $.05 per common share was declared by the Companys Board of Directors, payable on or about April 1, 2005. The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $.0425 per common share in January, May, August and November 2004 and $.0288 per common share in January, May, August and November 2003. Stock Repurchase Program. In January 2004, the Company announced that the Board of Directors authorized a new stock repurchase program of up to $350 million for 2004 and 2005. In 2004, the Company repurchased approximately 6.5 million shares for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $175 million. The Company repurchased a total of $150 million of common stock each year during 2003 and 2002 under a prior program. The Company estimates that cash flows from operations, existing bank credit lines and trade credit are adequate to meet operating cash needs, fund its planned capital investments, repurchase common stock and make quarterly dividend payments for at least the next twelve months. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of the Companys consolidated financial statements requires management of the Company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. These estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements: Merchandise Inventory. The Companys merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined on a weighted average cost method. The Company purchases manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as packaway inventory. Packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in the Companys warehouses until a later date, which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year. Included in the carrying value of the Companys merchandise inventory is a provision for shrinkage. The shrinkage reserve is based on historical shrinkage rates as evaluated through the Companys physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated, additional merchandise inventory write downs may be required. Long lived Assets. The Company records a long lived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. An impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group. Should actual results differ materially from projected results, an impairment charge may be required in the future. During 2004, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $15.8 million before taxes to write down the carrying value and account for the sale of its Newark facility. In the course of performing this analysis, management determined that no other long lived asset impairment charge was required for years ended January 29, 2005, January 31, 2004 and February 1, 2003. Self Insurance. The Company self insures certain of its workers compensation and general liability risks as well as certain of its health insurance plans. The Companys self insurance liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care and state statutory requirements increase beyond what was anticipated, reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required. 24 The above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the Companys accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by GAAP, with no need for managements judgment in their application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result. See the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto, which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by GAAP. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued the revised Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which establishes standards for the accounting for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. SFAS No. 123(R) requires recognition of stock based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for periods beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company will implement the requirements of the standard as of the beginning of the third quarter of 2005. The impact of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) will be dependent on numerous factors including, but not limited to, the valuation model chosen by the Company to value stock based awards; the assumed award forfeiture rate; the accounting policies adopted concerning the method of recognizing the fair value of awards over the requisite service period; and the transition method chosen for adopting SFAS No. 123(R). The Company has not yet quantified the effects of the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). In November 2004, the FASB issued the revised SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage). SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company does not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will have a material impact on the Companys operating results or financial position. dds DISCOUNTSSM During 2004, the Company opened ten initial dds DISCOUNTSSM stores, a new off price concept targeted to serve the needs of lower income households, which it believes to be one of the fastest growing demographic markets in the country. The Company opened these initial stores at locations in California during the second half of 2004. This new business generally has similar merchandise departments and categories to those of Ross, but features a different mix of brands, consisting mostly of moderate department store and discount store labels at lower average price points. The average dds DISCOUNTSSM store is approximately 26,000 gross square feet and is located in an established strip shopping center in densely populated urban and suburban neighborhoods. The dds DISCOUNTSSM and Ross merchant, store and distribution organizations are separate and distinct; however, dds DISCOUNTSSM shares other certain corporate and support services with Ross. Forward Looking Statements and Risk Factors Affecting Future Performance This report includes certain forward looking statements regarding planned new store growth and expected sales and earnings levels, which reflect the Companys current beliefs, projections and estimates with respect to future events and the Companys future financial performance, operations and competitive position. The words expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, looking ahead, forecast, guidance, plan, projected, and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. Risks and uncertainties that apply to both Ross and dds DISCOUNTSSM stores include, without limitation, the Companys ability to effectively operate and integrate various new supply chain and core merchandising systems, including generation of all necessary information in a timely and cost effective manner; migrating the Companys data center from Newark, California to Pleasanton, California in the first half of 2005 without unexpected delays or interruption in system availability; achieving and maintaining targeted levels of productivity and efficiency in its distribution centers; obtaining acceptable new store locations; competitive pressures in the apparel industry; changes in the level of consumer spending on or preferences for apparel or home related merchandise; changes in geopolitical and general economic conditions; unseasonable weather trends; disruptions in supply chain; lower than planned gross margin and greater than planned 25 operating costs; the Companys ability to continue to purchase attractive brand name merchandise at desirable discounts, the Companys ability to identify and successfully enter new geographic markets, and the Companys ability to attract and retain personnel with the retail talent necessary to execute its strategies. The Companys corporate headquarters, certain of its distribution centers and 30% of its stores are located in California. Therefore, a downturn in the California economy or a major California natural disaster could significantly affect the Companys operating results and financial condition. The Companys continued success depends, in part, upon its ability to increase sales at existing locations, and to open new stores and to operate stores on a profitable basis. There can be no assurance that the Companys existing strategies and store expansion program will result in a continuation of revenue growth or profit growth. Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue and profitability remain difficult to predict. The factors underlying the Companys forecasts are dynamic and subject to change. As a result, any forecasts speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect the Companys outlook at any other point in time. The Company disclaims any obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Company is exposed to market risks, which primarily include changes in interest rates. The Company does not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes. Interest that is payable on the Companys revolving credit facilities and long term debt is based on variable interest rates and is, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. In addition, lease payments under certain of the Companys synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. As of January 29, 2005, the Company had no borrowings outstanding under its revolving credit facilities and had $50 million of long term debt outstanding which accrues interest at LIBOR plus 150 basis points. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted the Companys consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as of and for the year ended January 29, 2005. The Company does not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates to be material. The Company uses forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. The Company had no outstanding forward contracts at January 29, 2005. 26
