ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Overview We are the second largest off price apparel and home goods retailer in the United States, with 714 Ross stores in 26 states and Guam, and 20 dds DISCOUNTS store locations in California at January 28, 2006. Ross offers first quality, in season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty store regular prices. dds DISCOUNTS features a more moderately priced assortment of first quality, in season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices. Our primary strategy is to pursue and refine our existing off price business, and steadily expand our store base. In establishing growth objectives for our business, we closely monitor market share trends for the off price industry. Sales for the off price sector grew by 11.3% during 2005, which is significantly faster than total national apparel sales, which grew by 3.6%, according to data from the NPD Group, which provides global sales and marketing information on the retail industry. This reflects the ongoing importance of value to consumers. Our strategies are designed to take advantage of these growth trends and continued customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and the home at competitive everyday discounts. We refer to our fiscal years ended January 28, 2006, January 29, 2005, and January 31, 2004 as 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively.

Total stores open at the end of 2005, 2004 and 2003 were 734, 649 and 568, respectively. The number of stores at the end of 2005, 2004 and 2003 increased by 13%, 14% and 12% from the respective prior fiscal years. Our operating strategy is to open additional stores based on local market penetration, the ability to leverage overhead expenses, local demographic characteristics including population, and competition. We continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations. We also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria. 2005 2004 2003 Stores at the beginning of the period 649 568 507 Stores opened in the period 86 84 66 Stores closed in the period (1 ) (3 ) (5 ) Stores at the end of the period 734 649 568 Selling square footage at the end of the period (000) 17,319 15,253 13,321 Sales. Sales for 2005 increased $704.2 million, or 17%, compared to the same period in the prior year due to the opening of 85 net new stores during 2005, the impact of the stores opened in 2004, and a 6% increase in sales from comparable stores (defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months). Sales for 2004 increased $319.4 million, or 8%, compared to the same period in the prior year due to the opening of 81 net new stores during 2004, and the impact of the stores opened in 2003, partially offset by a 1% decrease in sales from comparable stores. Sales for 2003 increased $389.2 million, or 11%, compared to the same period in the prior year due to the opening of 61 net new stores in 2003, the impact of stores opened in 2002, and a 1% increase in sales from comparable stores. Our sales mix is shown below for 2005, 2004 and 2003: 2005 2004 2003 Ladies 34 % 34 % 33 % Home accents and bed and bath 21 % 21 % 21 % Mens 16 % 16 % 17 % Fine jewelry, accessories, lingerie and fragrances 11 % 12 % 12 % Childrens 9 % 9 % 9 % Shoes 9 % 8 % 8 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % We expect to address the competitive climate for apparel and home goods off price retailers by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization, to diversify the merchandise mix, and to more fully develop the organization and systems to strengthen regional and local merchandise offerings. Although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in 2005, 2004 and 2003, we can not be sure that they will result in a continuation of revenue or profit growth. Cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold in 2005 increased $552.4 million compared to the same period in the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 85 net new stores during the year, the impact of the stores opened in 2004, and increased distribution and logistics costs. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for 2005 increased approximately 15 basis points compared with the same period in the prior year. This increase was driven by a 40 basis point decrease in merchandise gross margin, mainly due to higher shortage costs. In addition, higher freight costs drove a 20 basis point increase in distribution and logistics costs as a percent of sales. These increases in total cost of goods sold were partially offset by about a 25 basis point decrease in store occupancy costs and a 20 basis point decrease in buying expenses, due to leverage from the 6% increase in comparable store sales during the year. 16 Cost of goods sold in 2004 increased $361.1 million compared to the same period in the prior year, mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 81 net new stores during the year, the impact of the stores opened in 2003, higher markdowns and increased distribution and logistics costs. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for 2004 increased approximately 290 basis points compared to 2003 due to higher distribution and logistics costs, lower merchandise gross margin largely due to higher markdowns and reduced leverage resulting from the 1% decrease in comparable store sales which contributed to higher occupancy and buying expenses as a percentage of sales, and buying costs related to the launch of dds DISCOUNTS. We can not be sure that the gross profit margins realized in 2005, 2004 and 2003 will continue in future years. For fiscal 2006 and future years, we expect some decrease in our gross profit margins as a result of increases in our cost of goods sold to reflect a portion of the additional stock based compensation expenses we will recognize under SFAS No. 123(R) Share Based Payment. See the further discussion of SFAS No. 123(R), and our expectation regarding the amount of the additional costs, under New Accounting Pronouncements. Also refer to the discussion under Stock based compensation in Note A to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our historical, pro forma equity compensation cost calculation. Selling, general and administrative expenses. For 2005, selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased $122.0 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 85 net new stores during the period, in addition to higher incentive plan costs. For 2005, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales increased approximately 25 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year. This increase is primarily due to an approximate 40 basis point increase relating to higher incentive plan costs and about 30 basis points due to increased information technology costs and related depreciation. These higher costs were partially offset by a 35 basis point decrease in store operating and advertising costs and a 10 basis point decrease in other general and administrative expenses, which both benefited from leverage on the 6% increase in comparable store sales. For 2004, SG&A increased $36.0 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 81 net new stores during the period, partially offset by lower incentive plan costs. SG&A as a percentage of sales decreased by approximately 35 basis points, primarily due to an approximate 55 basis point decrease in incentive plan costs partially offset by a 20 basis point increase in store payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of sales. The largest component of SG&A is payroll. The total number of employees, including both full and part time, at January 28, 2006, January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004 was approximately 33,200, 30,100 and 26,600, respectively. For fiscal 2006 and future years, we expect some increase in our SG&A to reflect a portion of the additional stock based compensation expenses we will recognize under SFAS No. 123(R). See the further discussion of SFAS No. 123(R), and our expectation regarding the amount of the additional costs, under New Accounting Pronouncements. Also refer to the discussion under Stock based compensation in Note A to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our historical, pro forma equity compensation cost calculation. Interest. In 2005, interest expense increased $1.1 million and interest income increased $4.9 million compared to the prior year. As a percentage of sales, net interest expense (income) in 2005 remained relatively flat compared to the prior year. The table below reflects interest expense and income for 2005, 2004 and 2003: ($ millions) 2005 2004 2003 Interest expense $ 4.1 $ 3.0 $ 1.4 Interest income (7.0 ) (2.1 ) (1.7 ) Total interest (income) expense, net $ (2.9 ) $ 0.9 $ (0.3 ) 17 Impairment of long lived assets. During the second quarter of 2004, we relocated our corporate headquarters from Newark, California to Pleasanton, California and decided to pursue a sale of our Newark, California distribution center and corporate headquarters (Newark Facility). We recognized a non cash impairment charge of $18 million before taxes in the second quarter of 2004 to write down the carrying value of our Newark Facility from its net book value of approximately $33 million to the estimated fair value at the time of approximately $15 million. During the third quarter of 2004, we sold the Newark Facility for net proceeds of approximately $17 million. We recognized a gain (reduction in impairment loss) of approximately $2 million in the third quarter of 2004 on this sale. For 2004 the net impairment charge recognized was approximately $16 million. Taxes on earnings. Our effective tax rate for 2005, 2004 and 2003 was approximately 39%, which represents the applicable federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit realized for state income taxes. The effective rate is impacted by changes in law, location of new stores, level of earnings and the result of tax audits. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 will be approximately 38% to 40%. Net earnings. Net earnings as a percentage of sales remained flat in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily due to increased cost of goods sold and selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales partially offset by the absence of an impairment charge and increased interest income as a percentage of sales. Net earnings as a percentage of sales decreased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily due to higher cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales partially offset by lower selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales. Diluted earnings per share in 2005 was $1.36, compared to $1.13 in 2004, inclusive of the $.06 impairment charge related to the Newark Facility and $.01 related to lease accounting adjustments attributable to the prior year. This increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 17% increase in net earnings and a 3% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding. Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and short term trade credit. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for seasonal and new store merchandise inventory purchases, capital expenditures in connection with opening new stores, and investments in information systems and infrastructure. We also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends. ($000) 2005 2004 2003 Cash flows from operating activities $ 375,191 $ 298,157 $ 321,471 Cash flows used in investing activities (132,396 ) (199,541 ) (152,694 ) Cash flows used in financing activities (166,359 ) (184,831 ) (117,880 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 76,436 $ (86,215 ) $ 50,897 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $375.2 million, $298.2 million and $321.5 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The primary source of cash from operations in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was net earnings plus non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization, partially offset by cash used to finance merchandise inventory. The increase in cash flows from operations in 2005 is primarily due to an increase in net earnings, which is partially offset by the change in cash used for merchandise inventory. Working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) was $350 million at the end of 2005, compared to $416 million at the end of 2004, 18 and $410 million at the end of 2003. The decrease in working capital in 2005 compared to the prior year is primarily a result of reclassifying a $50 million term loan to current liabilities. Our primary source of liquidity is the sale of our merchandise inventory. We regularly review the age and condition of the merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slower moving merchandise through clearance markdowns. Investing Activities In 2005, 2004 and 2003, we spent approximately $175.9 million, $149.5 million and $152.7 million, respectively, for capital expenditures (excluding leased equipment) for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new stores, implement management information technology systems, install and implement materials handling equipment and related distribution center systems, and various other expenditures related to existing stores, buying offices, corporate offices and the purchase of a warehouse in Moreno Valley, California. We opened 86, 84 and 66 new stores and relocated, remodeled or expanded 2, 3 and 1 stores in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In addition, during 2005 we received proceeds from sales of investments of $43.5 million. During 2004 we received approximately $17.4 million in net proceeds from the sale of the Newark Facility and invested $67.4 million in short term investments. We are forecasting approximately $265 million in capital expenditures for 2006 to fund fixtures and leasehold improvements to open both new Ross and dds DISCOUNTS stores. In addition, these capital expenditures are expected to fund the relocation, or remodel of existing stores, and investments in store and merchandising systems, distribution center land, buildings, equipment and systems, and various central office expenditures. This capital expenditure forecast assumes we will exercise our right to purchase the leased assets at our Fort Mill, South Carolina distribution center. We expect to fund these expenditures out of cash flows from operations, and existing and potential new bank and credit facilities. Our cash flows used for capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below: ($ millions) 2005 2004 2003 New stores $ 63.3 $ 58.7 $ 51.1 Store renovations and improvements 31.9 25.5 15.1 Information systems 19.8 37.0 34.7 Distribution centers, corporate office and other 60.9 28.3 51.8 Total capital expenditures $ 175.9 $ 149.5 $ 152.7 Financing Activities During 2005, 2004 and 2003, liquidity and capital requirements were provided by cash flows from operations, bank credit facilities and trade credit. Substantially all of our store locations, buying offices, our headquarters, and certain distribution centers are leased and, except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment, do not represent long term capital investments. We own a distribution center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania and our warehouse in Moreno Valley, California. We repurchased 6.4 million, 6.5 million and 6.9 million shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $175 million, $175 million and $150 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, under the stock repurchase programs funded by cash flows from operations. Short term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for investments in merchandise inventory. Trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors. We regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade, bank and credit lines to meet our capital and liquidity requirements, including debt maturities and lease obligations in 2006. 19 The table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of January 28, 2006: ($000) Contractual Obligations Less than 1 year 2 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Total Term debt $ 50,496 $ $ $ $ 50,496 Operating leases 245,362 440,631 342,627 410,928 1,439,548 Other financings: Synthetic leases 10,069 8,986 8,182 10,227 37,464 Other synthetic lease obligations 85,022 1,844 56,000 142,866 Purchase obligations 644,774 12,581 2,594 659,949 Total contractual obligations $ 1,035,723 $ 464,042 $ 353,403 $ 477,155 $ 2,330,323 Term debt. We have a $50 million senior unsecured term loan to finance the equipment and information systems for our Perris, California distribution center. In March 2006, we paid the $50 million term debt balance in full. We incurred interest expense on term debt of $0.5 million in fiscal 2006, which was calculated based upon prevailing interest rates (LIBOR plus 175 basis points) and is included in Term debt in the table above. Interest was payable no less than monthly at the banks applicable prime rate or at LIBOR plus an applicable margin (175 basis points) which resulted in an effective interest rate of 6.3% at January 28, 2006. Borrowings under this term loan were subject to certain operating and financial covenants including maintaining certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of January 28, 2006, we were in compliance with these covenants. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Operating leases. Substantially all of our store sites, certain distribution centers, and our buying offices and corporate headquarters are leased and, except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment, do not represent long term capital investments. We own our distribution center in Carlisle, Pennsylvania and our warehouse in Moreno Valley, California. We have lease arrangements for certain equipment in our stores for our POS hardware and software systems. These leases are accounted for as operating leases for financial reporting purposes. The initial terms of these leases are two years, and we typically have options to renew the leases for two to three one year periods. Alternatively, we may purchase or return the equipment at the end of the initial or each renewal term. We have guaranteed the value of the equipment at the end of the respective initial lease terms of $12.6 million, which is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the table above. In January 2004, we commenced the lease on our corporate headquarters in Pleasanton, California. The lease has an initial term of 10.5 years with three five year renewal options. In October 2004, we entered into a lease arrangement to use a portion of the Newark Facility to support distribution activities for dds DISCOUNTS for an initial lease term of two years with three one year renewal options, a minor part of its remaining useful life. Other financings. We lease a 1.3 million square foot distribution center in Fort Mill, South Carolina. This distribution center, including equipment and systems, is being financed under an $87.3 million five year synthetic lease facility that expires in May 2006. Rent expense on this center is payable monthly at 90 basis points over LIBOR on the lease balance of $87.3 million. We have estimated rent expense on the lease which is calculated based upon prevailing interest rates (LIBOR plus 90 basis points, which resulted in an effective interest rate of 5.5% at January 28, 2006) and is included in Synthetic leases in the contractual obligations table above. At the end of the lease term, 20 the Company must refinance the $87.3 million synthetic lease facility, purchase the distribution center at the amount of the then outstanding lease balance, or arrange a sale of the distribution center to a third party. We have agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor up to 85% of the lease balance. Our obligation under this residual value guarantee of $74.2 million is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the contractual obligations table above. We also lease a 1.3 million square foot distribution center in Perris, California. This distribution center is being financed under a $70.0 million ten year synthetic lease facility that expires in July 2013. Rent expense on this center is payable monthly at a fixed annual rate of 5.8% on the lease balance of $70.0 million. At the end of the lease term, the Company must refinance the $70.0 million synthetic lease facility, purchase the distribution center at the amount of the then outstanding lease balance, or arrange a sale of the distribution center to a third party. If the distribution center is sold to a third party for less than $70.0 million, we have agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor the shortfall below $70.0 million not to exceed $56.0 million. Our contractual obligation of $56.0 million is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the above table. The $50.0 million financing of equipment and systems for the Perris, California center is included in Term debt in the table above. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, we have recognized a liability and corresponding asset for the fair value of the residual value guarantee in the amount of $8.3 million for the Perris, California distribution center and $1.8 million for the POS lease. These residual value guarantees are being amortized on a straight line basis over the original terms of the leases. The current portion of the related asset and liability is recorded in Prepaid expenses and other and Accrued expenses and other, respectively, and the long term portion of the related assets and liabilities is recorded in Other long term assets and Other long term liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In addition, we lease two separate warehouse facilities for packaway storage in Carlisle, Pennsylvania with operating leases expiring through 2011. In January 2004, we entered into a two year lease with two one year options for a warehouse facility in Fort Mill, South Carolina, the first option of which has been exercised extending the term to February 1, 2007. These three leased facilities are being used primarily to store packaway merchandise. The synthetic lease facilities described above, as well as our term debt and revolving credit facility, have covenant restrictions requiring us to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. In addition, the interest rates under these agreements may vary depending on our actual interest coverage ratios. As of January 28, 2006, we were in compliance with these covenants. In December 2003, the FASB issued the revised FIN No. 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of entities that are not controllable through voting interests or in which the equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks and rewards. FIN No. 46(R) explains how to identify variable interest entities and how an enterprise should assess its interest in an entity to decide whether to consolidate that entity. We were not required under FIN No. 46(R) to consolidate our synthetic leases since the lessors/owners are not variable interest entities. Purchase obligations. As of January 28, 2006 we had purchase obligations of $659.9 million. These purchase obligations primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to store fixtures and supplies, and information technology service and maintenance contracts. Merchandise inventory purchase orders of $614.5 million represent purchase obligations of less than one year as of January 28, 2006. 21 Commercial Credit Facilities The table below presents our significant available commercial credit facilities at January 28, 2006: Amount of commitment expiration per period Total amount committed ($000) Commercial Credit Commitments Less than 1 year 2 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Revolving credit facility1 $ $ $ 600,000 $ $ 600,000 Total commercial commitments $ $ $ 600,000 $ $ 600,000 1 Contains a $200 million sublimit for issuances of standby letters of credit, of which $61.7 million is outstanding and $138.3 million is available as of January 28, 2006. For additional information relating to these credit facilities, refer to Note C of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revolving credit facility. In 2004, we entered into a $600 million revolving credit facility with our banks, which contains a $200 million sublimit for issuances of standby letters of credit of which $138.3 million was available at January 28, 2006. Interest is LIBOR based plus an applicable margin (currently 75 basis points) and is payable upon borrowing maturity but no less than quarterly. Our borrowing ability under this credit facility is subject to our maintaining certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. We have had no borrowings under this facility. This revolving credit facility expires in March 2009. Standby letters of credit. We use standby letters of credit to collateralize certain obligations related to our self insured workers compensation and general liability claims. We had $61.7 million and $65.8 million in standby letters of credit outstanding at January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, respectively. Trade letters of credit. We had $16.5 million and $17.0 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at January 28, 2006 and January 29, 2005, respectively. Dividends. In January 2006, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $.06 per common share, payable on or about March 31, 2006. Our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $.06 per common share in November 2005, $.05 per common share in January, May and August 2005, and cash dividends of $.0425 per common share in January, May, August and November 2004. Stock repurchase programs. In January 2004, our Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program of up to $350 million for 2004 and 2005. We repurchased 6.4 million and 6.5 million shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $175 million and $175 million in 2005 and 2004, respectively. We repurchased a total of $150 million of common stock each year during 2003 and 2002 under a prior program. In November 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a new two year stock repurchase program of up to $400 million for 2006 and 2007. We estimate that cash flows from operations, bank credit lines and trade credit are adequate to meet operating cash needs, fund our planned capital investments, repay our term loan, address the amount due in connection with our Fort Mill, South Carolina distribution center, repurchase common stock and make quarterly dividend payments for at least the next twelve months. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. These estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable. We believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 22 Merchandise inventory. Our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a weighted average cost method. We purchase manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as packaway inventory. Packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date, which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year. Included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shrinkage. The shrinkage reserve is based on historical shrinkage rates as evaluated through our periodic physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts. If actual market conditions, markdowns, or shrinkage are less favorable than those projected by us, or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated, additional merchandise inventory write downs may be required. Long lived assets. We record a long lived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. An impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group. If our actual results differ materially from projected results, an impairment charge may be required in the future. During 2004, we recognized an impairment charge of $15.8 million before taxes to write down the carrying value and account for the sale of our Newark Facility. In the course of performing our annual analysis, we determined that no other long lived asset impairment charge was required for the years ended January 28, 2006, January 29, 2005 and January 31, 2004. Depreciation and amortization expense. Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically ranging from five to twelve years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for real property. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term, whichever is less. Lease accounting. We currently capitalize rent during a construction build out period and amortize it over the lease term commencing when the leased premises are substantially ready for their intended use. We will adopt FASB Staff Position (FSP) 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction Period, which requires that rental costs incurred during a construction period be expensed, not capitalized, beginning in 2006. When a lease contains rent holidays or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, we record rental expense on a straight line basis and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent. We amortize deferred rent on a straight line basis over the lease term commencing on the date the leased space is ready for its intended use. Tenant improvement allowances are included in other long term liabilities and are amortized over the lease term. Changes in tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Self insurance. We self insure certain of our workers compensation and general liability risks as well as certain of our health plans. Our self insurance liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care and state statutory requirements increase beyond what was anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required. The list above is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), with no need for managements judgment in their application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result. See our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by GAAP. New Accounting Pronouncements In November 2004, the FASB issued the revised SFAS No. 151, Inventory Costs, which clarifies the accounting for abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs and wasted material (spoilage). SFAS No. 151 is effective for inventory costs incurred during fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We do not believe that the adoption of SFAS No. 151 will have a material impact on our operating results or financial position. 23 In December 2004, the FASB issued the revised SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment, which establishes accounting standards for transactions in which an entity exchanges its equity instruments for goods or services. SFAS No. 123(R) requires recognition of stock based compensation expense in the consolidated financial statements over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. SFAS No. 123(R) is effective for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2005. We will implement the requirements of the standard as of the beginning of our fiscal year 2006. We will use the modified prospective approach for adoption of SFAS No. 123(R). Under this approach, prior periods are not revised for comparative purposes. The valuation provisions of SFAS No. 123(R) will apply to new awards granted in our fiscal year 2006 and later and to awards that are outstanding from prior fiscal years if they are subsequently modified or canceled. These awards will be valued using the Black Scholes option pricing model, consistent with our prior pro forma disclosures under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Compensation expense for awards outstanding at the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost calculated for the previously reported pro forma disclosure purposes. For awards granted after the beginning of our 2006 fiscal year, we will recognize expense on a straight line basis over the applicable vesting term. We do not believe that the impact from adopting this standard will be materially different from what has been reported in our prior pro forma disclosures, and expect the effect to represent compensation costs equivalent to about $.06 per share for fiscal 2006. See the discussion under Stock based compensation in Note A to Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding our pro forma equity compensation cost calculations for 2005, 2004 and 2003. The stock based compensation we will recognize after the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) will be affected by the number of stock based awards granted in the future and the assumptions used for estimating the fair values of options. In May 2005, the FASB issued SFAS No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections which requires retrospective application to prior periods financial statements of changes in an accounting principle, unless it is impracticable to determine either the period specific effects or the cumulative effect of the change. We do not expect the adoption of SFAS No. 154, which is effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005, will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In October 2005, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 13 1, Accounting for Rental Costs Incurred During a Construction Period, to clarify the proper accounting for rental costs incurred on building or ground operating leases during a construction period. The FSP requires that rental costs incurred during a construction period be expensed, not capitalized. The statement is effective for the first reporting period beginning after December 15, 2005. We will adopt FSP 13 1 beginning in our fiscal year 2006 and do not believe that adoption of this standard will have a material impact on our operating results or financial position. Forward Looking Statements Our Annual Report on Form 10 K for fiscal 2005, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders, press releases, telephonic reports and other investor communications including on our website, may contain a number of forward looking statements regarding, without limitation, planned store growth, new markets, expected sales, projected earnings levels, capital expenditures and other matters. These forward looking statements reflect our then current beliefs, projections and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance, operations and competitive position. The words plan, expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, forecast, projected, guidance, looking ahead and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue, profitability, and growth remain difficult to predict. As a result, our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forward looking statements and our previous expectations and projections. Refer to Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a more complete discussion of risk factors for Ross and dds DISCOUNTS. The factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change. As a result, any forecasts or forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements. 24 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risks, which primarily include changes in interest rates. We do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes. We occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. We had no outstanding forward contracts at January 28, 2006. Interest that is payable on our revolving credit facilities and term debt is based on variable interest rates and is, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. In addition, lease payments under certain of our synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. As of January 28, 2006, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and had $50 million of term debt outstanding which accrues interest at LIBOR plus 175 basis points. In addition, the lease on our distribution center in Fort Mill, South Carolina accrues interest at LIBOR plus 90 basis points. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as of and for the year ended January 28, 2006. We do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible, near term changes in interest rates to be material. 25
