Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the second largest off price apparel and home goods retailer in the United States. At the end of fiscal 2007, there were 838 Ross Dress for Less (Ross) locations in 27 states and Guam, and 52 dds DISCOUNTS stores in four states. Ross offers first quality, in season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty store regular prices. dds DISCOUNTS features a more moderately priced assortment of first quality, in season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices. Our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing off price strategies to drive gains in profitability and improved financial returns over the long term. In establishing appropriate growth targets for our business, we closely monitor market share trends for the off price industry. Total aggregate sales for the five largest off price retailers in the United States grew 6% during 2007 on top of an 8% increase in 2006. We believe this solid growth reflects the ongoing importance of value to consumers. Our strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of our off price industry as well as continued customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling everyday discounts. We refer to our fiscal years ended February 2, 2008, February 3, 2007, and January 28, 2006 as fiscal 2007, fiscal 2006, and fiscal 2005, respectively. Fiscal 2006 was 53 weeks. Fiscal 2007 and 2005 were 52 weeks. Results of Operations The following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal years ended February 2, 2008, February 3, 2007, and January 28, 2006. 2007 2006 2005 Sales Sales (millions) $ 5,975 $ 5,570 $ 4,944 Sales growth 7.3% 12.7% 16.6% Comparable store sales growth (52 week basis) 1% 4% 6% Costs and expenses (as a percent of sales) Cost of goods sold 77.3% 77.5% 77.9% Selling, general and administrative 15.7% 15.5% 15.5% Interest income, net (0.1)% (0.2)% (0.1)% Earnings before taxes (as a percent of sales) 7.1% 7.2% 6.6% Net earnings (as a percent of sales) 4.4% 4.3% 4.0% 17 Stores. Total stores open at the end of 2007, 2006 and 2005 were 890, 797 and 734, respectively. The number of stores at the end of fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 increased by 12%, 9% and 13% from the respective prior years. Our expansion strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration, local demographic characteristics, competition, and the ability to leverage overhead expenses. We continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations. We also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria. 2007 2006 2005 Stores at the beginning of the period 797 734 649 Stores opened in the period 97 66 86 Stores closed in the period (4) (3) (1) Stores at the end of the period 890 797 734 Selling square footage at the end of the period (000) 21,100 18,600 17,300 Sales. Sales for fiscal 2007 increased $405.0 million, or 7.3%, compared to the prior year due to the opening of 93 net new stores during 2007, and a 1% increase in sales from comparable stores (defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months). Sales for fiscal 2006 increased $626.0 million, or 12.7%, compared to the same period in the prior year due to the opening of 63 net new stores during 2006, and a 4% increase in sales from comparable stores. Our sales mix for Ross is shown below for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005: 2007 2006 2005 Ladies 32% 33% 34% Home accents and bed and bath 23% 22% 21% Mens 15% 15% 16% Fine jewelry, accessories, lingerie and fragrances 11% 11% 11% Shoes 10% 10% 9% Childrens 9% 9% 9% Total 100% 100% 100% We expect to address the competitive climate for off price apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization, to diversify the merchandise mix, and to more fully develop the organization and systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings. Although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, we cannot be sure that they will result in a continuation of sales growth or an increase in net earnings. Stock based compensation. Effective in fiscal 2006, we adopted SFAS No. 123(R) and elected to adopt the standard using the modified prospective transition method. This new accounting standard requires recognition of compensation expense based on the grant date fair value of all stock based awards, typically amortized over the vesting period. The impact on results for fiscal 2006 was to decrease earnings before taxes by approximately $13.2 million, and net income by approximately $8.0 million. See Notes A and C in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our stock based compensation plans and implementation of SFAS No. 123(R). 18 Cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2007 increased $300.7 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 93 net new stores during the year, and a 1% increase in sales from comparable stores. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2007 decreased approximately 20 basis points from the prior year. This improvement was mainly the result of a 20 basis point improvement in merchandise margin primarily due to lower markdowns and shortage as a percent of sales. Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2006 increased $464.9 million compared to the same period in the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 63 net new stores during the year, a 4% increase in sales from comparable stores, and additional stock compensation expenses recognized pursuant to SFAS No. 123(R). Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2006 decreased approximately 40 basis points compared with the same period in the prior year. This improvement was driven mainly by a 40 basis point improvement in merchandise gross margin, primarily due to lower markdowns and shortage as a percent of sales, and a 35 basis point improvement in distribution costs. These gains were partially offset by an approximate 25 basis point increase in freight costs and a 10 basis point increase in expenses related to SFAS No. 123(R). We cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 will continue in future years. Selling, general and administrative expenses. For fiscal 2007, selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased $72.9 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 93 net new stores during the year. SG&A as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2007 grew by approximately 15 basis points over the prior year. This increase was mainly driven by a 40 basis point rise in store operating expenses compared to fiscal 2006, which benefited from leverage related to the 53rd week. Store operating costs in 2007 were also impacted by minimum wage increases and the de leveraging effect of the 1% gain in comparable store sales. These cost pressures were partially offset by a 25 basis point decline in other general and administrative costs. For fiscal 2006, SG&A increased $96.9 million compared to the same period in the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 63 net new stores during the year. For fiscal 2006, SG&A as a percentage of sales was unchanged compared to the same period in the prior year. An approximately 15 basis point increase in expense related to SFAS No. 123(R) and a 5 basis point increase in store related expenses were offset by a 20 basis point decrease in other general and administrative costs related to lower workers compensation costs and leverage on the 53rd week of operations in fiscal 2006. The largest component of SG&A is payroll. The total number of employees, including both full and part time, as of fiscal year end 2007, 2006, and 2005 was approximately 39,100, 35,800, and 33,200, respectively. 19 Interest. In fiscal 2007, interest expense increased $6.9 million due to higher average borrowings as compared to the prior year, and interest income increased $2.3 million due to higher cash and investment balances as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of sales, the reduction in net interest income in fiscal 2007 decreased pre tax earnings by approximately 10 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year. The table below shows interest expense and income for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005: ($ millions) 2007 2006 2005 Interest expense $ 9.8 $ 2.9 $ 4.1 Interest income (13.8) (11.5) (7.0) Total interest income, net $ (4.0) $ (8.6) $ (2.9) Taxes on earnings. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was approximately 39%, which represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns. The effective rate is affected by changes in law, location of new stores, level of earnings and the result of tax audits. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 will be in the range of 38% to 40%. Net earnings. Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2007 were higher compared to fiscal 2006 primarily due to lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2006 were higher compared to fiscal 2005 primarily due to lower cost of goods sold and higher interest income as a percentage of sales while SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales remained unchanged. Earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2007 were $1.90, compared to $1.70 in fiscal 2006 on a 53 week basis. This 12% increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 8% increase in net earnings and a 3% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding, largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2006 were $1.70, compared to $1.36 in fiscal 2005. This 25% increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 21% increase in net earnings and a 3% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program. 20 Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and short term trade credit. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for seasonal and new store merchandise inventory purchases, capital expenditures in connection with opening new stores, and investments in distribution centers, information systems and infrastructure. We also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends. ($000) 2007 2006 2005 Cash flows from operating activities $ 353,559 $ 506,867 $ 375,191 Cash flows used in investing activities (244,743) (235,941) (132,396) Cash flows used in financing activities (218,624) (95,305) (166,359) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (109,808) $ 175,621 $ 76,436 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $353.6 million, $506.9 million and $375.2 million in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The primary source of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005 was net earnings plus non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization, partially offset by cash used to finance merchandise inventory. The increase in cash flow from operating activities resulted from an increase in accounts payable in 2006 over 2005 of $221.6 million primarily driven by timing associated with the additional 53rd week in fiscal 2006. Working capital (defined as current assets less current liabilities) was $387.4 million at the end of fiscal 2007, compared to $431.7 million at the end of fiscal 2006, and $349.9 million at the end of fiscal 2005. The decrease in working capital in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006 is primarily due to lower cash and investments and timing associated with the additional 53rd week in fiscal 2006. The increase in working capital in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005 is primarily due to higher cash and investments. Our primary source of liquidity is the sale of our merchandise inventory. We regularly review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slower moving merchandise through clearance markdowns. 21 Investing Activities In fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, our capital expenditures (excluding leased equipment) were approximately $236.1 million, $223.9 million and $175.9 million, respectively, for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new stores, implement information technology systems, build distribution centers and implement material handling equipment and related distribution center systems, and various other expenditures related to our stores, buying and corporate offices. Fiscal 2006 included the purchase of distribution center assets under a lease of $87.3 million. We opened 97, 66 and 86 new stores and relocated one, two, and two stores in fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. In fiscal 2007 we had purchases of investments of $146.1 million and sales of investments of $137.1 million. In fiscal 2006 we had purchases of investments of $71.9 million and sales of investments of $59.3 million. In fiscal 2005 we had purchases of $313.6 million and sales of investments of $357.0 million. We are forecasting approximately $250 million in capital requirements in 2008 to fund expenditures for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open both new Ross and dds DISCOUNTS stores, the relocation, or upgrade of existing stores, and investments in store and merchandising systems, distribution center land, buildings, equipment and systems, and various buying and corporate office expenditures. We expect to fund these expenditures with cash flows from operations and existing credit facilities. Our capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below: ($ millions) 2007 2006 2005 New stores $ 110.1 $ 49.5 $ 63.3 Store renovations and improvements 32.3 42.4 31.9 Information systems 21.4 13.4 19.8 Distribution centers, corporate office and other 72.3 118.6 60.9 Total capital expenditures $ 236.1 $ 223.9 $ 175.9 Financing Activities During fiscal 2007, 2006 and 2005, our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by cash flows from operations, trade credit, and issuance of senior notes. All but two of our store locations, our buying offices, our corporate headquarters, and one distribution center are leased and, except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment, do not represent long term capital investments. We own three distribution centers in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, Moreno Valley, California, and Fort Mill, South Carolina. In November 2005, we announced that our Board of Directors authorized a two year stock repurchase program of up to $400 million for 2006 and 2007. We repurchased 6.9 million and 7.1 million shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $200 million in both 2007 and 2006. These repurchases were funded by cash flows from operations. In March 2006, we repaid our $50 million term debt in full. In October 2006, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with various institutional investors for $150 million of unsecured, senior notes. See Senior Notes below for more information. 22 In January 2008, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $.095 per common share, payable on or about March 31, 2008. Our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $.075 per common share in January, May, August and November 2007, and cash dividends of $.06 per common share in January, May, August, and November 2006. Also in January 2008 our Board of Directors approved a new two year $600 million stock repurchase program for fiscal 2008 and 2009. Short term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for investments in merchandise inventory. Trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors. We regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade, bank and other credit lines to meet our capital and liquidity requirements, including lease payment obligations in 2008. We estimate that cash flows from operations, bank credit lines and trade credit are adequate to meet operating cash needs, fund our planned capital investments, repurchase common stock and make quarterly dividend payments for at least the next twelve months. Contractual Obligations The table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of February 2, 2008: ($000) Less than 1 1 3 3 5 After 5 Contractual Obligations year years years years Total1 Senior Notes $ $ $ $ 150,000 $ 150,000 Interest payment obligations 9,668 19,335 19,335 69,530 117,868 Operating leases: Rent obligations 307,991 550,483 421,637 457,863 1,737,974 Synthetic leases 10,494 8,688 8,182 2,045 29,409 Other synthetic lease obligations 4,733 1,317 56,000 62,050 Purchase obligations 760,833 10,020 210 771,063 Total contractual obligations $ 1,093,719 $ 589,843 $ 449,364 $ 735,438 $ 2,868,364 1 Pursuant to the guidelines of FIN 48, a $23.2 million reserve for unrecognized tax benefits is included in other long term liabilities on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. These obligations are excluded from the schedule above as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. Senior Notes. In October 2006, we entered into a Note Purchase Agreement with various institutional investors for $150 million of unsecured, senior notes. The notes were issued in two series and funding occurred in December 2006. Series A notes were issued for an aggregate of $85 million, are due in December 2018, and bear interest at a rate of 6.38%. Series B notes were issued for an aggregate of $65 million, are due in December 2021, and bear interest at a rate of 6.53%. Interest on these notes is included in Interest payment obligations in the table above. Borrowings under these notes are subject to certain operating and financial covenants including maintaining certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of February 2, 2008, we were in compliance with these covenants. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Operating leases. All but two of our store sites, one of our distribution centers, and our buying offices and corporate headquarters are leased and, except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment, do not represent long term capital investments. 23 We have lease arrangements for certain equipment in our stores for our point of sale (POS) hardware and software systems. These leases are accounted for as operating leases for financial reporting purposes. The initial terms of these leases are two years, and we typically have options to renew the leases for two to three one year periods. Alternatively, we may purchase or return the equipment at the end of the initial or each renewal term. We have guaranteed the value of the equipment of $6.1 million, at the end of the respective initial lease terms, which is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the table above. We lease approximately 181,000 square feet of office space for our corporate headquarters in Pleasanton, California, under several facility leases. The terms for these leases expire between 2010 and 2014 and contain renewal provisions. The Company leases approximately 138,000 and 15,000 square feet of office space for our New York and Los Angeles buying offices, respectively. The lease terms for these facilities expire in 2015 and 2011, respectively. The lease term for the New York office contains a renewal provision. We lease a 1.3 million square foot distribution center in Perris, California. The land and building for this distribution center are financed under a $70 million ten year synthetic lease that expires in July 2013. Rent expense on this center is payable monthly at a fixed annual rate of 5.8% on the lease balance of $70 million. At the end of the lease term, we have the option to either refinance the $70 million synthetic lease facility, purchase the distribution center at the amount of the then outstanding lease obligation, or arrange a sale of the distribution center to a third party. If the distribution center is sold to a third party for less than $70 million, we have agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor any shortfall amount up to $56 million. Our contractual obligation of $56 million is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the above table. In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation (FIN) No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, we have recognized a liability and corresponding asset for the fair value of the residual value guarantee in the amount of $8.3 million for the Perris, California distribution center and $0.6 million for the POS leases. These residual value guarantees are being amortized on a straight line basis over the original terms of the leases. The current portion of the related asset and liability is recorded in prepaid expenses and accrued expenses, respectively, and the long term portion of the related assets and liabilities is recorded in other long term assets and other long term liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. In November 2001 we entered into a nine year lease for a 239,000 square foot warehouse and a ten year lease for a 246,000 square foot warehouse in Carlisle, Pennsylvania. In June 2006, we entered into a two year lease extension with one one year option for a 253,000 square foot warehouse in Fort Mill, South Carolina, extending the term to February 2009. In March 2008, we amended the term of this lease to February 2010 and obtained three three year options. In August 2007, we entered into a five year lease for a 423,000 square foot warehouse also in Fort Mill, South Carolina. All four of these properties are used to store our packaway inventory. We also lease a 10 acre parcel which we currently have under construction for future trailer parking adjacent to our Perris distribution center. The synthetic lease facilities described above, as well as our revolving credit facility and senior notes, have covenant restrictions requiring us to maintain certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. In addition, the interest rates under these agreements may vary depending on actual interest coverage ratios achieved. As of February 2, 2008, we were in compliance with these covenants. Purchase obligations. As of February 2, 2008 we had purchase obligations of $771.1 million. These purchase obligations primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to store fixtures and supplies, and information technology service and maintenance contracts. Merchandise inventory purchase orders of $692.9 million represent purchase obligations of less than one year as of February 2, 2008. 24 Commercial Credit Facilities The table below presents our significant available commercial credit facilities at February 2, 2008: ($000) Amount of commitment expiration per period Total Less than 1 3 3 5 After 5 Amount Commercial Credit Commitments 1 year years years years Committed Revolving credit facility $ $ $ 600,000 $ $ 600,000 Total commercial commitments $ $ $ 600,000 $ $ 600,000 For additional information relating to this credit facility, refer to Note D of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revolving credit facility. We have available a $600 million revolving credit facility with our banks, which contains a $300 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit, of which $238.9 million was available at February 2, 2008. In July 2006, we amended this facility to extend the expiration date to July 2011 and change the letter of credit sublimit and interest pricing. Interest is LIBOR based plus an applicable margin (currently 45 basis points) and is payable upon borrowing maturity but no less than quarterly. Our borrowing ability under this credit facility is subject to our maintaining certain interest coverage and leverage ratios. As of February 2, 2008 we had no borrowings outstanding under this facility and were in compliance with the covenants. Standby letters of credit. We use standby letters of credit to collateralize certain obligations related to our self insured workers compensation and general liability claims. We had $61.1 million and $66.4 million in standby letters of credit outstanding at February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, respectively. Trade letters of credit. We had $20.8 million and $26.0 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at February 2, 2008 and February 3, 2007, respectively. Other Activities Distribution center purchase. In May 2006, we exercised our option to purchase our Fort Mill, South Carolina distribution center and paid cash in the amount of $87.3 million to acquire the facility from the lessor. We estimated the fair value of the components of the facility and the related equipment using various valuation techniques, including appraisals, market prices, and cost data. The amounts we recorded for each component were based on these fair value estimates. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. These estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable. We believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Merchandise inventory. Our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a weighted average cost basis. We purchase manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as "packaway" inventory. Packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date, which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year. 25 Included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage. The shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our periodic physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts. If actual market conditions, markdowns, or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us, or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated, additional merchandise inventory write downs may be required. Long lived assets. We record a long lived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. An impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group. If our actual results differ materially from projected results, an impairment charge may be required in the future. In the course of performing our annual analysis, we determined that no long lived asset impairment charge was required for fiscal 2007, 2006, or 2005. Depreciation and amortization expense. Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically ranging from five to twelve years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for real property. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term. Lease accounting. When a lease contains rent holidays or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, we record rental expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent. We amortize deferred rent on a straight line basis over the lease term commencing on the possession date. Tenant improvement allowances are included in other long term liabilities and are amortized over the lease term. Tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating cash flows in the consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Self insurance. We self insure certain of our workers compensation and general liability risks as well as certain coverages under our health plans. Our self insurance liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required. Stock based compensation. We account for stock based compensation under the provisions of SFAS No. 123(R). The determination of the fair value of stock options and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (ESPP) shares, using the Black Scholes model, is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions as to our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards, actual and projected employee stock option exercise behavior, the risk free interest rate and expected dividends. SFAS No. 123(R) requires companies to estimate future expected forfeitures at the date of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates. In previous fiscal years, we had recognized the impact of forfeitures as they occurred. Starting in fiscal 2006, we use historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and to recognize stock based compensation expense. All stock based compensation awards are amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards. Income Taxes. We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (FIN 48), which supplements SFAS No. 109 Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS No. 109) effective February 4, 2007. FIN 48 clarifies the criteria that an individual tax position must satisfy for some or all of the benefits of that position to be recognized in a companys consolidated financial statements. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not, and a measurement standard for all tax positions taken or expected to be taken on a tax return, in order for those tax positions to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. 26 The critical accounting policies noted above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), with no need for managements judgment in their application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result. See our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by GAAP. Effects of inflation or deflation. We do not consider the effects of inflation or deflation to be material to our financial position and results of operations. New Accounting Pronouncements SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS No. 157 defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands required disclosures about fair value measurements. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 157 will have a material impact on our operating results or financial position. SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS No. 159) is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. SFAS No. 159 establishes a fair value option under which entities can elect to report certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, with changes in fair value recognized in earnings. We do not believe the adoption of SFAS No. 159 will have a material impact on our operating results or financial position. Forward Looking Statements Our Annual Report on Form 10 K for fiscal 2007, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders, press releases, telephonic reports and other investor communications including on our website, may contain a number of forward looking statements regarding, without limitation, planned store growth, new markets, expected sales, projected earnings levels, capital expenditures and other matters. These forward looking statements reflect our then current beliefs, projections and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance, operations and competitive position. The words plan, expect, anticipate, estimate, believe, forecast, projected, guidance, looking ahead and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue, profitability, and growth remain difficult to predict. As a result, our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forward looking statements and our previous expectations and projections. Refer to Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a more complete discussion of risk factors for Ross and dds DISCOUNTS. The factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change. As a result, any forecasts or forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time. We do not undertake to update or revise these forward looking statements. 27 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. We are exposed to market risks, which primarily include changes in interest rates. We do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes. We occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. We had no outstanding forward contracts as of February 2, 2008. Interest that is payable on our revolving credit facilities is based on variable interest rates and is, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. In addition, lease payments under certain of our synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. As of February 2, 2008, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facilities. In addition, we issued notes to institutional investors in two series: Series A for $85.0 million accrues interest at 6.38% and Series B for $65.0 million accrues interest at 6.53%. The amount outstanding under these notes as of February 2, 2008 is $150.0 million. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows as of and for the year ended February 2, 2008. We do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible, near term changes in interest rates to be material. 28
