Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Overview We are the second largest off price apparel and home goods retailer in the United States. At the end of fiscal 2009, we operated 953 Ross Dress for Less (Ross) locations in 27 states and Guam, and 52 dds DISCOUNTS stores in four states. Ross offers first quality, in season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20 to 60 percent off department and specialty store regular prices. dds DISCOUNTS features a more moderately priced assortment of first quality, in season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear and home fashions at everyday savings of 20 to 70 percent off moderate department and discount store regular prices. Our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing off price strategies to maintain or improve profitability and improve financial returns over the long term. In establishing appropriate growth targets for our business, we closely monitor market share trends for the off price industry. Total aggregate sales for five of the largest off price retailers in the United States increased 7% during 2009 on top of a 3% increase in 2008. This compares to total national apparel sales which declined 5% during 2009 compared to a 3% decline in 2008, according to data published by the NPD Group, Inc., which provides global sales and marketing information on the retail industry. We believe that the stronger relative sales gains of the off price retailers during 2009 were driven mainly by the increased focus on value by consumers, whose spending continued to be pressured by the challenging macro economic environment. Our sales and earnings gains in 2009 benefited from efficient execution of our resilient and flexible off price business model. Our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of our off price industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling everyday discounts. Looking ahead to 2010, we are planning to maintain tight controls of both inventory levels and operating expenses as part of our strategy to help us maximize our profitability. We refer to our fiscal years ended January 30, 2010, January 31, 2009, and February 2, 2008 as fiscal 2009, fiscal 2008, and fiscal 2007, respectively. Fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007 were 52 weeks. 18 Results of Operations The following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal years ended 2009, 2008, and 2007. 2009 2008 2007 Sales Sales (millions) $ 7,184 $ 6,486 $ 5,975 Sales growth 10.8% 8.6% 7.3% Comparable store sales growth 6% 2% 1% Costs and expenses (as a percent of sales) Cost of goods sold 74.2% 76.4% 77.3% Selling, general and administrative 15.7% 16.0% 15.7% Interest expense (income), net 0.1% 0.0% (0.1% ) Earnings before taxes (as a percent of sales) 10.0% 7.6% 7.1% Net earnings (as a percent of sales) 6.2% 4.7% 4.4% Stores. Total stores open at the end of 2009, 2008, and 2007 were 1,005, 956, and 890, respectively. The number of stores at the end of fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007 increased by 5%, 7%, and 12% from the respective prior years. Our expansion strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration, local demographic characteristics, competition, expected store profitability, and the ability to leverage overhead expenses. We continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations. We also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria. 2009 2008 2007 Stores at the beginning of the period 956 890 797 Stores opened in the period 56 77 98 Stores closed in the period (7 ) (11 ) (5 ) Stores at the end of the period 1,005 956 890 Selling square footage at the end of the period (000) 23,700 22,500 21,100 Sales. Sales for fiscal 2009 increased $698.1 million, or 10.8%, compared to the prior year due to the opening of 49 net new stores during 2009, and a 6% increase in sales from comparable stores (defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months). Sales for fiscal 2008 increased $510.9 million, or 8.6%, compared to the prior year due to the opening of 66 net new stores during 2008, and a 2% increase in sales from comparable stores. 19 Our sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007: 2009 2008 2007 Ladies 30% 32% 32% Home accents and bed and bath 24% 23% 23% Mens 13% 14% 15% Accessories, lingerie, fine jewelry, and fragrances 13% 12% 11% Shoes 11% 10% 10% Childrens 9% 9% 9% Total 100% 100% 100% We expect to address the competitive climate for off price apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization, to diversify our merchandise mix, and to more fully develop our organization and systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings. Although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, we cannot be sure that they will result in a continuation of sales growth or an increase in net earnings. Cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2009 increased $370.7 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 49 net new stores during the year, and a 6% increase in sales from comparable stores. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2009 decreased approximately 230 basis points from the prior year. This improvement was mainly the result of a 170 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin, which includes a 40 basis point benefit from lower shortage. In addition, freight costs declined by about 50 basis points, occupancy leveraged 35 basis points, and distribution costs declined by about 10 basis points. These improvements were partially offset by a 35 basis point increase in buying expenses due in part to higher incentive costs versus the prior year. Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2008 increased $338.4 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 66 net new stores during the year, and a 2% increase in sales from comparable stores. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2008 decreased approximately 90 basis points from the prior year. This improvement was mainly the result of a 100 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin. In addition, distribution costs for the year improved by about 20 basis points. As a percent of sales, these favorable trends were partially offset by a 10 basis point increase in occupancy expense and a 20 basis point increase in incentive costs. We cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007 will continue in future years. Selling, general and administrative expenses. For fiscal 2009, selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased $96.5 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 49 net new stores during the year. SG&A as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2009 decreased by approximately 20 basis points compared to the prior year. This decrease was mainly driven by 40 basis points of leverage on store operating expenses partially offset by a 20 basis point increase in general and administrative expenses due in part to higher incentive costs versus the prior year. For fiscal 2008, SG&A increased $98.5 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 66 net new stores during the year. 20 SG&A as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2008 grew by approximately 30 basis points over the prior year. This increase was mainly driven by a 20 basis point increase in store operating expenses and a 10 basis point increase in general and administrative costs as a percent of sales. The largest component of SG&A is payroll. The total number of employees, including both full and part time, as of fiscal year end 2009, 2008, and 2007 was approximately 45,600, 40,000, and 39,100, respectively. Interest expense (income), net. In fiscal 2009, interest expense increased by $1.1 million primarily due to lower capitalization of construction interest. In fiscal 2009, interest income decreased by $6.7 million primarily due to lower investment yields as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of sales, net interest expense in fiscal 2009 decreased pre tax earnings by approximately 10 basis points compared to the same period in the prior year. The table below shows interest expense and income for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007: ($ millions) 2009 2008 2007 Interest expense $ 9.4 $ 8.3 $ 9.8 Interest income (1.8 ) (8.5 ) (13.8 ) Total interest expense (income), net $ 7.6 $ (0.2 ) $ (4.0 ) Taxes on earnings. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007 was approximately 38%, 38%, and 39%, respectively, which represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns. The effective rate is affected by changes in law, location of new stores, level of earnings, and the resolution of tax positions with various taxing authorities. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 will be in the range of 38% to 39%. Net earnings. Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2009 were higher compared to fiscal 2008 primarily due to both lower cost of goods sold and lower SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2008 were higher compared to fiscal 2007 primarily due to lower cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales, partially offset by higher SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. Earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2009 was $3.54, compared to $2.33 in fiscal 2008. This 52% increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 45% increase in net earnings and a 5% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding, largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2008 was $2.33, compared to $1.90 in fiscal 2007. This 23% increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 17% increase in net earnings and a 4% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding, largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program. 21 Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and short term trade credit. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases, payroll, capital expenditures in connection with opening new stores, and investments in distribution centers and information systems. We also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends. ($ millions) 2009 2008 2007 Cash flows provided by operating activities $ 888.4 $ 583.4 $ 353.5 Cash flows used in investing activities (136.8 ) (218.7 ) (244.7 ) Cash flows used in financing activities (304.6 ) (300.9 ) (218.6 ) Net increase (decrease) in cash and cash equivalents $ 447.0 $ 63.8 $ (109.8 ) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $888.4 million, $583.4 million, and $353.5 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. The primary sources of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007 were net earnings plus non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization. Accounts payable leverage (defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory) was 75% as of January 30, 2010 and 61% as of January 31, 2009. The increase in leverage was due to faster turns on lower inventory levels. Our primary source of liquidity is the sale of our merchandise inventory. We regularly review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slower moving merchandise through clearance markdowns. Investing Activities In fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, our capital expenditures were $158.5 million, $224.4 million, and $236.1 million, respectively. Our capital expenditures included fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new stores, implement information technology systems, build or expand distribution centers, and various other expenditures related to our stores, buying and corporate offices. In fiscal 2008 we also purchased land in South Carolina with the intention of building a new distribution center in the future. We opened 56, 77, and 98 new stores in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively, which included relocating one store in 2009 and one store in 2007. We had purchases of investments of $2.9 million, $37.0 million, and $146.1 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. We had sales of investments of $24.5 million, $42.5 million, and $137.1 million in fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. 22 We are forecasting approximately $215 million in capital requirements in 2010 to fund expenditures for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open both new Ross and dds DISCOUNTS stores, for the relocation, or upgrade of existing stores, for investments in store and merchandising systems, buildings, equipment and systems, and for various buying and corporate office expenditures. We expect to fund these expenditures with available cash, cash flows from operations, and trade credit. Our capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below: ($ millions) 2009 2008 2007 New stores $ 55.4 $ 52.0 $ 110.1 Store renovations and improvements 44.3 47.3 32.3 Information systems 10.4 13.2 21.4 Distribution centers, corporate office, and other 48.4 111.9 72.3 Total capital expenditures $ 158.5 $ 224.4 $ 236.1 Financing Activities During fiscal 2009, 2008, and 2007, our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash, cash flows from operations, and trade credit. Our buying offices, our corporate headquarters, one distribution center, one trailer parking lot, three warehouse facilities, and all but two of our store locations are leased and, except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment, do not represent capital investments. We own one distribution center in each of the following cities: Carlisle, Pennsylvania; Moreno Valley, California; and Fort Mill, South Carolina; and one warehouse facility in Fort Mill, South Carolina. In January 2008, our Board of Directors approved a two year $600 million stock repurchase program for fiscal 2008 and 2009. We repurchased 7.4 million and 9.3 million shares of common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $300 million in both 2009 and 2008. In January 2010, our Board of Directors approved a two year $750 million stock repurchase program for fiscal 2010 and 2011. In January 2010, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend payment of $.16 per common share, payable on March 31, 2010. Our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $.11 per common share in January, May, August, and November 2009, and cash dividends of $.095 per common share in January, May, August, and November 2008. Short term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventory. Trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors. We regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade, bank, and other credit lines to meet our capital and liquidity requirements, including lease payment obligations in 2010. We estimate that cash flows from operations, bank credit lines, and trade credit are adequate to meet operating cash needs, fund our planned capital investments, repurchase common stock, and make quarterly dividend payments for at least the next twelve months. 23 Contractual Obligations The table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of January 30, 2010: Less than 1 After 5 ($000) year 1 3 years 3 5 years years Total1 Senior Notes $ $ $ $ 150,000 $ 150,000 Interest payment obligations 9,667 19,335 19,335 50,195 98,532 Capital leases 291 45 336 Operating leases: Rent obligations 333,077 660,350 502,136 500,278 1,995,841 Synthetic leases 5,681 8,886 1,705 16,272 Other synthetic lease obligations 1,564 1,030 56,000 58,594 Purchase obligations 1,078,071 7,886 831 1,086,788 Total contractual obligations $ 1,428,351 $ 697,532 $ 580,007 $ 700,473 $ 3,406,363 1 We have a $33.6 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits that is included in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. This liability is excluded from the schedule above as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. Senior Notes. We have two series of unsecured senior notes outstanding with various institutional investors for $150 million. The Series A notes totaling $85 million are due in December 2018 and bear interest at a rate of 6.38%. The Series B notes totaling $65 million, are due in December 2021, and bear interest at a rate of 6.53%. Interest on these notes is included in Interest payment obligations in the table above. These notes are subject to prepayment penalties for early payment of principal. Borrowings under these notes are subject to certain operating and financial covenants, including maintaining certain interest coverage and other financial ratios. As of January 30, 2010, we were in compliance with these covenants. Capital leases. The obligations under capital leases relate to distribution center equipment and have terms of two to three years. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Operating leases. We lease our two buying offices, our corporate headquarters, one distribution center, one trailer parking lot, three warehouse facilities, and all but two of our store locations. Except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment, these leased locations do not represent long term capital investments. We have lease arrangements for certain equipment in our stores for our point of sale (POS) hardware and software systems. These leases are accounted for as operating leases for financial reporting purposes. The initial terms of these leases are either two or three years, and we typically have options to renew the leases for two to three one year periods. Alternatively, we may purchase or return the equipment at the end of the initial or each renewal term. We have guaranteed the value of the equipment of $2.6 million, at the end of the respective initial lease terms, which is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the table above. 24 We lease approximately 181,000 square feet of office space for our corporate headquarters in Pleasanton, California, under several facility leases. The terms for these leases expire between 2011 and 2015 and contain renewal provisions. We lease approximately 197,000 and 26,000 square feet of office space for our New York City and Los Angeles buying offices, respectively. The lease terms for these facilities expire in 2021 and 2014, respectively and contain renewal provisions. We lease a 1.3 million square foot distribution center in Perris, California. The land and building for this distribution center are financed under a $70 million ten year synthetic lease that expires in July 2013. Rent expense on this center is payable monthly at a fixed annual rate of 5.8% on the lease balance of $70 million. At the end of the lease term, we have the option to either refinance the $70 million synthetic lease facility, purchase the distribution center at the amount of the then outstanding lease obligation, or arrange a sale of the distribution center to a third party. If the distribution center is sold to a third party for less than $70 million, we have agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor any shortfall amount up to $56 million. The agreement includes a prepayment penalty for early payoff of the lease. Our contractual obligation of $56 million is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the above table. We have recognized a liability and corresponding asset for the inception date estimated fair value of the residual value guarantee in the amount of $8.3 million for the Perris, California distribution center and $0.9 million for the POS leases. These residual value guarantees are being amortized on a straight line basis over the original terms of the leases. The current portion of the related asset and liability is recorded in prepaid expenses and accrued expenses, respectively, and the long term portion of the related assets and liabilities is recorded in other long term assets and other long term liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We lease two warehouses in Carlisle, Pennsylvania with one lease expiring in 2013 and the other expiring in 2014. In January 2009, we exercised a three year option for a 255,000 square foot warehouse in Fort Mill, South Carolina, extending the term to February 2013. In June 2008, we purchased a 423,000 square foot warehouse also in Fort Mill, South Carolina. All four of these properties are used to store our packaway inventory. We also lease a 10 acre parcel of land that has been developed for trailer parking adjacent to our Perris distribution center. The synthetic lease facilities described above, as well as our revolving credit facility and senior notes, have covenant restrictions requiring us to maintain certain interest coverage and other financial ratios. In addition, the interest rates under the revolving credit facility may vary depending on actual interest coverage ratios achieved. As of January 30, 2010, we were in compliance with these covenants. Purchase obligations. As of January 30, 2010 we had purchase obligations of $1,087 million. These purchase obligations primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to store fixtures and supplies, and information technology service and maintenance contracts. Merchandise inventory purchase orders of $1,044 million represent purchase obligations of less than one year as of January 30, 2010. 25 Commercial Credit Facilities The table below presents our significant available commercial credit facilities at January 30, 2010: Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Total Less than 1 3 3 5 After 5 amount ($000) 1 year years years years committed Revolving credit facility $ $ 600,000 $ $ $ 600,000 Total commercial commitments $ $ 600,000 $ $ $ 600,000 For additional information relating to this credit facility, refer to Note D of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revolving credit facility. We have available a $600 million revolving credit facility with our banks, which contains a $300 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit, of which $234.8 million was available at January 30, 2010. This credit facility which expires in July 2011 has a LIBOR based interest rate plus an applicable margin (currently 45 basis points) and is payable upon maturity but not less than quarterly. Our borrowing ability under this credit facility is subject to our maintaining certain financial ratios. As of January 30, 2010 we had no borrowings outstanding under this facility and were in compliance with the covenants. Standby letters of credit. We use standby letters of credit to collateralize certain obligations related to our self insured workers compensation and general liability claims. We had $65.2 million and $60.4 million in standby letters of credit outstanding at January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively. Trade letters of credit. We had $32.9 million and $16.7 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009, respectively. Other 2008 Equity Incentive Plan. In May 2008, our stockholders approved the adoption of the Ross Stores, Inc. 2008 Equity Incentive Plan (the 2008 Plan) with an initial share reserve of 8.3 million shares of our common stock, of which 6.0 million shares can be issued as full value awards. The 2008 Plan provides for various types of incentive awards, which may potentially include the grant of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock purchase rights, restricted stock bonuses, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, and deferred compensation awards. Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. These estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable. We believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. 26 Merchandise inventory. Our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost determined on a weighted average cost basis. We purchase manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as "packaway" inventory. Packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date, which may even be the beginning of the same selling season in the following year. Packaway inventory accounted for approximately 38% of total inventories as of January 30, 2010 and January 31, 2009. Merchandise inventory includes acquisition, processing, and storage costs related to packaway inventory. Included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage. The shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our periodic physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts. If actual market conditions, markdowns, or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us, or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated, additional merchandise inventory write downs may be required. Long lived assets. We record a long lived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. An impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group. If our actual results differ materially from projected results, an impairment charge may be required in the future. In the course of performing our annual analysis, we determined that no long lived asset impairment charge was required for fiscal 2009, 2008, or 2007. Depreciation and amortization expense. Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically ranging from five to twelve years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for real property. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term. Lease accounting. When a lease contains rent holidays or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, we record rental expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent. We amortize deferred rent on a straight line basis over the lease term commencing on the possession date. Tenant improvement allowances are included in other long term liabilities and are amortized over the lease term. Tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating cash flows in the consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Self insurance. We self insure certain of our workers compensation and general liability risks as well as certain coverages under our health plans. Our self insurance liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required. Stock based compensation. We recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all stock based awards, typically over the vesting period. We use historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and to recognize stock based compensation expense. All stock based compensation awards are expensed over the service or performance periods of the awards. Income taxes. We account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740. We are required to make assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures. Our policy is to recognize interest and or penalties related to all tax positions in income tax expense. To the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made. 27 The critical accounting policies noted above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), with no need for managements judgment in their application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result. See our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by GAAP. Effects of inflation or deflation. We do not consider the effects of inflation or deflation to be material to our financial position and results of operations. New Accounting Pronouncements In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued ASC 810 (originally issued as SFAS No. 167, Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R)). Among other things, ASC 810 responds to concerns about the application of certain key provisions of FIN 46(R), including those regarding the transparency of the involvement with variable interest entities. ASC 810 is effective for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2009. We do not believe the adoption of ASC 810 will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. Forward Looking Statements Our Annual Report on Form 10 K for fiscal 2009, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders, press releases, telephonic reports, and other investor communications including on our corporate website, may contain a number of forward looking statements regarding, without limitation, planned store growth, new markets, expected sales, projected earnings levels, capital expenditures, and other matters. These forward looking statements reflect our then current beliefs, projections, and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance, operations, and competitive position. The words plan, expect, target, anticipate, estimate, believe, forecast, projected, guidance, looking ahead, and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue, profitability, and growth remain difficult to predict. As a result, our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forward looking statements and our previous expectations and projections. Refer to Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a more complete discussion of risk factors for Ross and dds DISCOUNTS. The factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change. As a result, any forecasts or forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time. We do not undertake to update or revise these forward looking statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. We are exposed to market risks, which primarily include changes in interest rates. We do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes. We occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. We had no outstanding forward contracts as of January 30, 2010. 28 Interest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. As of January 30, 2010, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. In addition, lease payments under certain of our synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. In addition, we issued notes to institutional investors in two series: Series A for $85 million accrues interest at 6.38% and Series B for $65 million accrues interest at 6.53%. The amount outstanding under these notes as of January 30, 2010 is $150 million. Interest is receivable on our short and long term investments. Changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in the future, or the fair value of our investment portfolio. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or the fair values of our short and long term investments as of and for the year ended January 30, 2010. We do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible, near term changes in interest rates to be material. 29
