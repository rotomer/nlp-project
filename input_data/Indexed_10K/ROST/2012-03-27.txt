ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. Overview Ross Stores, Inc. operates two off price retail chains Ross Dress for Less (Ross) and dds DISCOUNTS. Ross is the largest off price apparel and home fashion chain in the United States with 1,037 locations in 29 states, the District of Columbia, and Guam. Ross offers first quality, in season, name brand and designer apparel, accessories, footwear and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20% to 60% off department and specialty store regular prices. We also operate 88 dds DISCOUNTS locations in seven states that feature a more moderately priced assortment of first quality, in season, name brand apparel, accessories, footwear, and home fashions for the entire family at everyday savings of 20% to 70% off moderate department and discount store regular prices. Our primary objective is to pursue and refine our existing off price strategies to maintain or improve profitability and improve financial returns over the long term. In establishing appropriate growth targets for our business, we closely monitor market share trends for the off price industry. Total aggregate sales for the five largest off price retailers in the United States increased 6% during 2011 on top of an 8% increase in 2010. The 6% off price growth in 2011 compares favorably to total national apparel sales which increased 4%, according to data published by the NPD Group, Inc., a leading provider of comprehensive consumer and retail information worldwide. We believe that the stronger relative sales gains of the off price retailers during 2011 and 2010 were driven mainly by an increased focus on value by consumers over the past few years. Our sales and earnings gains in 2011 continued to benefit from efficient execution of our off price model throughout all areas of our business. Our merchandise and operational strategies are designed to take advantage of the expanding market share of the off price industry as well as the ongoing customer demand for name brand fashions for the family and home at compelling everyday discounts. Looking ahead to 2012, we are planning further reductions in average store inventory levels while continuing to maintain strict controls on operating expenses as part of our strategy to help maximize our profitability. We refer to our fiscal years ended January 28, 2012, January 29, 2011, and January 30, 2010 as fiscal 2011, fiscal 2010, and fiscal 2009, respectively. Fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 each had 52 weeks. 19 Results of Operations The following table summarizes the financial results for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009: 2011 2010 2009 Sales Sales (millions) $ 8,608 $ 7,866 $ 7,184 Sales growth 9.4% 9.5% 10.8% Comparable store sales growth 5% 5% 6% Costs and expenses (as a percent of sales) Cost of goods sold 72.5% 72.8% 74.2% Selling, general and administrative 15.2% 15.6% 15.7% Interest expense, net 0.1% 0.1% 0.1% Earnings before taxes (as a percent of sales) 12.2% 11.4% 10.0% Net earnings (as a percent of sales) 7.6% 7.1% 6.2% All share and per share amounts have been adjusted for the two for one stock split effective December 15, 2011. Stores. Total stores open at the end of fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 were 1,125, 1,055, and 1,005, respectively. The number of stores at the end of fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 increased by 7%, 5%, and 5% from the respective prior years. Our expansion strategy is to open additional stores based on market penetration, local demographic characteristics, competition, expected store profitability, and the ability to leverage overhead expenses. We continually evaluate opportunistic real estate acquisitions and opportunities for potential new store locations. We also evaluate our current store locations and determine store closures based on similar criteria. 2011 2010 2009 Stores at the beginning of the period 1,055 1,005 956 Stores opened in the period 80 56 56 Stores closed in the period (10 ) (6 ) (7 ) Stores at the end of the period 1,125 1,055 1,005 Selling square footage at the end of the period (000) 26,100 24,800 23,700 Sales. Sales for fiscal 2011 increased $742.2 million, or 9.4%, compared to the prior year due to the opening of 70 net new stores during 2011, and a 5% increase in sales from comparable stores (defined as stores that have been open for more than 14 complete months). Sales for fiscal 2010 increased $681.9 million, or 9.5%, compared to the prior year due to the opening of 50 net new stores during 2010, and a 5% increase in sales from comparable stores. 20 Our sales mix is shown below for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009: 2011 2010 2009 Ladies 29 % 29 % 30 % Home Accents and Bed and Bath 25 % 25 % 24 % Mens 13 % 13 % 13 % Accessories, Lingerie, Fine Jewelry, and Fragrances 13 % 12 % 13 % Shoes 12 % 12 % 11 % Childrens 8 % 9 % 9 % Total 100 % 100 % 100 % We intend to address the competitive climate for off price apparel and home goods by pursuing and refining our existing strategies and by continuing to strengthen our organization, to diversify our merchandise mix, and to more fully develop our organization and systems to improve regional and local merchandise offerings. Although our strategies and store expansion program contributed to sales gains in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, we cannot be sure that they will result in a continuation of sales growth or in an increase in net earnings. Cost of goods sold. Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2011 increased $511.0 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 70 net new stores during the year, and a 5% increase in sales from comparable stores. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2011 decreased approximately 35 basis points from the prior year. This improvement was mainly the result of a 50 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin, which included a 15 basis point benefit from lower shortage. In addition, occupancy leveraged 20 basis points. These improvements were partially offset by increases in freight costs of about 20 basis points, distribution expenses of about 10 basis points, and buying costs of about five basis points. Cost of goods sold in fiscal 2010 increased $402.5 million compared to the prior year mainly due to increased sales from the opening of 50 net new stores during the year, and a 5% increase in sales from comparable stores. Cost of goods sold as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2010 decreased approximately 130 basis points from the prior year. This improvement was mainly the result of an 80 basis point increase in merchandise gross margin, which included a 15 basis point benefit from lower shortage. In addition, occupancy leveraged 30 basis points, and distribution costs declined by about 30 basis points. These improvements were partially offset by an increase in freight costs of about 10 basis points. We cannot be sure that the gross profit margins realized in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 will continue in future years. Selling, general and administrative expenses. For fiscal 2011, selling, general and administrative expenses (SG&A) increased $74.3 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 70 net new stores during the year. SG&A as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2011 decreased by approximately 50 basis points compared to the prior year due equally to a combination of leverage on both general and administrative and store operating expenses. For fiscal 2010, SG&A increased $99.0 million compared to the prior year, mainly due to increased store operating costs reflecting the opening of 50 net new stores during the year. SG&A as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2010 decreased by approximately 10 basis points compared to the prior year mainly driven by leverage on store operating expenses. The largest component of SG&A is payroll. The total number of employees, including both full and part time, as of fiscal year end 2011, 2010, and 2009 was approximately 53,900, 49,500, and 45,600, respectively. 21 Interest expense (income), net. In fiscal 2011, interest expense increased by $0.3 million primarily due to issuance costs for our revolving credit facility, while interest income decreased by $0.4 million primarily due to lower investment yields as compared to the prior year. As a percentage of sales, net interest expense in fiscal 2011 remained flat compared to the prior year. The table below shows interest expense and income for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009: ($ millions) 2011 2010 2009 Interest expense $ 11.0 $ 10.7 $ 9.4 Interest income (0.7 ) (1.1 ) (1.8 ) Total interest expense, net $ 10.3 $ 9.6 $ 7.6 Taxes on earnings. Our effective tax rate for fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 was approximately 38% in each year, which represents the applicable combined federal and state statutory rates reduced by the federal benefit of state taxes deductible on federal returns. The effective rate is impacted by changes in laws, location of new stores, level of earnings, and the resolution of tax positions with various taxing authorities. We anticipate that our effective tax rate for fiscal 2012 will be about 38%. Net earnings. Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2011 were higher compared to fiscal 2010 primarily due to both lower cost of goods sold and lower SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. Net earnings as a percentage of sales for fiscal 2010 were higher compared to fiscal 2009 primarily due to both lower cost of goods sold and lower SG&A expenses as a percentage of sales. Earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2011 was $2.86, compared to $2.31 in fiscal 2010. This 24% increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 18% increase in net earnings and a 4% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding, largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program. Diluted earnings per share in fiscal 2010 was $2.31, compared to $1.77 in fiscal 2009. This 31% increase in diluted earnings per share is attributable to an approximate 25% increase in net earnings and a 4% reduction in weighted average diluted shares outstanding, largely due to the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program. Financial Condition Liquidity and Capital Resources Our primary sources of funds for our business activities are cash flows from operations and short term trade credit. Our primary ongoing cash requirements are for merchandise inventory purchases, payroll, rent, taxes, capital expenditures in connection with opening new stores, and investments in distribution centers and information systems. We also use cash to repurchase stock under our stock repurchase program and to pay dividends. ($ millions) 2011 2010 2009 Cash provided by operating activities $ 820.1 $ 673.0 $ 888.4 Cash used in investing activities (471.8 ) (196.8 ) (136.8 ) Cash used in financing activities (532.4 ) (410.6 ) (304.6 ) Net (decrease) increase in cash and cash equivalents $ (184.1 ) $ 65.6 $ 447.0 22 Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $820.1 million, $673.0 million, and $888.4 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The primary sources of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009 were net earnings excluding non cash expenses for depreciation and amortization. Our primary source of operating cash flow is the sale of our merchandise inventory. We regularly review the age and condition of our merchandise and are able to maintain current merchandise inventory in our stores through replenishment processes and liquidation of slower moving merchandise through clearance markdowns. Net cash from operations increased in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to higher net earnings and lower working capital used to purchase additional packaway inventory. We expect to continue to take advantage of packaway inventory opportunities to deliver bargains to our customers. As a regular part of our business, packaway inventory levels will vary over time based on availability of compelling opportunities in the marketplace. Packaway merchandise is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date. The timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to the Companys store merchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months. Changes in packaway inventory levels impact our operating cash flow. At the end of fiscal 2011, packaway inventory was 49% of total inventory compared to 47% and 38% at the end of fiscal 2010 and 2009, respectively. Packaway inventory as a percentage of our total inventory has increased since 2010 as we took advantage of the increased availability of compelling opportunities in the marketplace. The change in total merchandise inventory, net of the related change in accounts payable, resulted in a use of cash of approximately $55 million and $112 million for fiscal 2011 and 2010, respectively. Accounts payable leverage (defined as accounts payable divided by merchandise inventory) decreased to 67% as of January 28, 2012 from 71% as of January 29, 2011 as a result of higher packaway inventory. We believe that our existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, available bank credit lines and trade credit are adequate to meet our liquidity needs for at least the next twelve months. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $471.8 million, $196.8 million, and $136.8 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. The increase in cash used for investing activities for fiscal 2011, compared to the prior year was primarily due to higher capital expenditures and a transfer of funds into restricted accounts to serve as collateral for our insurance obligations. In fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, our capital expenditures were $416.3 million, $198.7 million, and $158.5 million, respectively. Our capital expenditures include costs for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open new stores and costs to implement information technology systems, build or expand distribution centers, and various other expenditures related to our stores, buying, and corporate offices. We opened 80, 56, and 56 new stores in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. In April 2011, we purchased a 449,000 square foot warehouse for packaway storage in Riverside, California for $20.5 million. In the fourth quarter of 2011, we purchased the land and building of an existing store location in Southern California which was previously leased, and we acquired land and buildings for our future corporate headquarters in Dublin, California, for a combined total of approximately $100 million. 23 We are forecasting approximately $450 million in capital expenditures in 2012 to fund expenditures for fixtures and leasehold improvements to open both new Ross and dds DISCOUNTS stores, for the relocation or upgrade of existing stores, for investments in store and merchandising systems, buildings, and equipment, for building distribution centers and implementing material handling equipment and related systems, and for various buying and corporate office expenditures. We expect to fund these expenditures with available cash and cash flows from operations. Our capital expenditures over the last three years are set forth in the table below: ($ millions) 2011 2010 2009 New stores $ 114.2 $ 75.5 $ 56.6 Existing stores 126.8 60.3 43.1 Distribution 86.1 32.0 30.3 Information systems, corporate, and other 89.2 30.9 28.5 Total capital expenditures $ 416.3 $ 198.7 $ 158.5 We had no purchases of investments in fiscal 2011, and purchased investments of $6.8 million and $2.9 million in fiscal 2010, and 2009, respectively. We had sales of investments of $4.6 million, $8.6 million, and $24.5 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $532.4 million, $410.6 million, and $304.6 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. During fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, our liquidity and capital requirements were provided by available cash and cash flows from operations. Our buying offices, our corporate headquarters, one distribution center, one trailer parking lot, three warehouse facilities, and all but three of our store locations are leased and, except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment, do not represent capital investments. We own distribution centers in each of the following cities: Carlisle, Pennsylvania; Moreno Valley, California; and Fort Mill, South Carolina; we own two warehouse facilities, one in Fort Mill, South Carolina and the other in Riverside, California. We repurchased 11.3 million, 13.5 million, and 14.8 million shares of our common stock for aggregate purchase prices of approximately $450 million, $375 million, and $300 million in fiscal 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. In January 2011, our Board of Directors approved a two year $900 million stock repurchase program for fiscal 2011 and 2012. In January 2012, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.14 per common share, payable on March 30, 2012. Our Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $.11 per common share in January, May, August, and November 2011, cash dividends of $.08 per common share in January, May, August, and November 2010, and cash dividends of $.055 per common share in January, May, August, and November 2009. Short term trade credit represents a significant source of financing for merchandise inventory. Trade credit arises from customary payment terms and trade practices with our vendors. We regularly review the adequacy of credit available to us from all sources and expect to be able to maintain adequate trade, bank, and other credit lines to meet our capital and liquidity requirements, including lease payment obligations in 2012. In March 2011, we entered into a new $600 million unsecured, revolving credit facility. This credit facility, which replaced our previous $600 million revolving credit facility, expires in March 2016. Interest on this facility is based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin (currently 150 basis points) and is payable upon maturity but not less than quarterly. As of January 28, 2012, our $600 million credit facility remains in place and available. We estimate that existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, bank credit lines, and trade credit are adequate to meet our operating cash needs and to fund our planned capital investments, common stock repurchases, and quarterly dividend payments for at least the next twelve months. 24 Contractual Obligations The table below presents our significant contractual obligations as of January 28, 2012: Less than 1 After 5 ($000) year 1 3 years 3 5 years years Total1 Senior notes $ $ $ $ 150,000 $ 150,000 Interest payment obligations 9,668 19,335 19,335 30,860 79,198 Operating leases: Rent obligations 364,788 711,005 492,481 444,571 2,012,845 Synthetic leases 5,223 1,714 6,937 Other synthetic lease obligations 989 56,183 57,172 Purchase obligations 1,237,333 5,291 47 1,242,671 Total contractual obligations $ 1,618,001 $ 793,528 $ 511,863 $ 625,431 $ 3,548,823 1We have a $53.5 million liability for unrecognized tax benefits that is included in other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. This liability is excluded from the schedule above as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. Senior notes. We have two series of unsecured senior notes with various institutional investors for $150 million. The Series A notes totaling $85 million are due in December 2018 and bear interest at a rate of 6.38%. The Series B notes totaling $65 million are due in December 2021 and bear interest at a rate of 6.53%. Interest on these notes is included in Interest payment obligations in the table above. These notes are subject to prepayment penalties for early payment of principal. Borrowings under these notes are subject to certain operating and financial covenants, including interest coverage and other financial ratios. As of January 28, 2012, we were in compliance with these covenants. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements Operating leases. We lease our buying offices, corporate headquarters, one distribution center, one trailer parking lot, three warehouse facilities, and all but three of our store locations. Except for certain leasehold improvements and equipment, these leased locations do not represent long term capital investments. We have lease arrangements for certain equipment in our stores for our point of sale (POS) hardware and software systems. These leases are accounted for as operating leases for financial reporting purposes. The initial terms of these leases are either two or three years, and we typically have options to renew the leases for two to three one year periods. Alternatively, we may purchase or return the equipment at the end of the initial or each renewal term. We have guaranteed the value of the equipment of $1.2 million at the end of the respective initial lease terms, which is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the table above. We lease a 1.3 million square foot distribution center in Perris, California. The land and building for this distribution center are financed by the lessor under a $70 million ten year synthetic lease that expires in July 2013. Rent expense on this center is payable monthly at a fixed annual rate of 5.8% on the lease balance of $70 million. At the end of the lease term, we have the option to either refinance the $70 million synthetic lease facility, purchase the distribution center at the amount of the then outstanding lease obligation, or arrange a sale of the distribution center to a third party. If the distribution center is sold to a third party for less than $70 million, we have agreed under a residual value guarantee to pay the lessor any shortfall amount up to $56 million. As of January 28, 2012, we have accrued approximately $4.6 million related to an estimated shortfall in the residual value guarantee recorded in accrued expenses and other in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. The synthetic lease agreement includes a prepayment penalty for early payoff of the lease. Our contractual obligation of $56 million is included in Other synthetic lease obligations in the above table. 25 We have also recognized a liability and corresponding asset for the inception date estimated fair values of the distribution center and POS synthetic lease residual value guarantees. As of January 28, 2012 we have approximately $1.4 million of residual value guarantee asset and liability. These residual value guarantees are amortized on a straight line basis over the original terms of the leases. The current portion of the related asset and liability is recorded in prepaid expenses and other and accrued expenses, respectively, and the long term portion of the related assets and liabilities is recorded in other long term assets and other long term liabilities, respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. We lease three warehouses. Two of the warehouses are in Carlisle, Pennsylvania with leases expiring in 2013 and 2014. The third warehouse is in Fort Mill, South Carolina, with a lease expiring in 2013. The leases for all three of these warehouses contain renewal provisions. We also own a 423,000 square foot warehouse in Fort Mill, South Carolina and a 449,000 square foot warehouse in Riverside, California. All five of these warehouses are used to store our packaway inventory. We also lease a 10 acre parcel that has been developed for trailer parking adjacent to our Perris, California distribution center. We lease approximately 181,000 square feet of office space for our corporate headquarters in Pleasanton, California, under several facility leases. The terms for these leases expire between 2014 and 2015 and contain renewal provisions. We lease approximately 201,000 and 26,000 square feet of office space for our New York City and Los Angeles buying offices, respectively. The lease terms for these facilities expire in 2021 and 2014, respectively, and contain renewal provisions. Purchase obligations. As of January 28, 2012 we had purchase obligations of approximately $1,243 million. These purchase obligations primarily consist of merchandise inventory purchase orders, commitments related to store fixtures and supplies, and information technology service and maintenance contracts. Merchandise inventory purchase orders of $1,172 million represent purchase obligations of less than one year as of January 28, 2012. Commercial Credit Facilities The table below presents our significant available commercial credit facilities at January 28, 2012: Amount of Commitment Expiration Per Period Less than 1 Total amount ($000) year 1 3 years 3 5 years After 5 years committed Revolving credit facility $ $ $ 600,000 $ $ 600,000 Total commercial commitments $ $ $ 600,000 $ $ 600,000 For additional information relating to this credit facility, refer to note D of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revolving credit facility. At January 28, 2012, we had available a $600 million unsecured revolving credit facility with our banks. This credit facility expires in March 2016 and contains a $300 million sublimit for issuance of standby letters of credit. Interest on this credit facility is based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin (currently 150 basis points) and is payable upon maturity but not less than quarterly. Our borrowing ability under this credit facility is subject to our maintaining certain financial ratios. As of January 28, 2012 we had no borrowings outstanding or letters of credits issued under this facility and were in compliance with the covenants. As of January 28, 2012, our $600 million credit facility remains in place and available. 26 The synthetic lease facilities described above, as well as our revolving credit facility and senior notes, have covenant restrictions requiring us to maintain certain interest coverage and other financial ratios. In addition, the interest rates under the revolving credit facility may vary depending on actual interest coverage ratios achieved. As of January 28, 2012, we were in compliance with these covenants. Standby letters of credit and collateral trust. In July 2011, we entered into new standby letters of credit outside of our revolving credit facility and set up a trust to collateralize our insurance obligations. As of January 28, 2012 we had $45.3 million in standby letters of credit which are collateralized by restricted cash and cash equivalents and $21.3 million in a collateral trust consisting of restricted cash, cash equivalents, and investments. At January 29, 2011, we had $69.6 million in standby letters of credit outstanding issued under our revolving credit facility. Trade letters of credit. We had $39.9 million and $35.2 million in trade letters of credit outstanding at January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011, respectively. Other Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts. These estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an ongoing basis and are based on historical experience and on various other factors that management believes to be reasonable. We believe the following critical accounting policies describe the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. Merchandise inventory. Our merchandise inventory is stated at the lower of cost (determined using a weighted average basis) or net realizable value. We purchase manufacturer overruns and canceled orders both during and at the end of a season which are referred to as "packaway" inventory. Packaway inventory is purchased with the intent that it will be stored in our warehouses until a later date. The timing of the release of packaway inventory to our stores is principally driven by the product mix and seasonality of the merchandise, and its relation to the Companys store merchandise assortment plans. As such, the aging of packaway varies by merchandise category and seasonality of purchase, but typically packaway remains in storage less than six months. Packaway inventory accounted for approximately 49% and 47% of total inventories as of January 28, 2012 and January 29, 2011. Merchandise inventory includes acquisition, processing, and storage costs related to packaway inventory. Included in the carrying value of our merchandise inventory is a provision for shortage. The shortage reserve is based on historical shortage rates as evaluated through our annual physical merchandise inventory counts and cycle counts. If actual market conditions, markdowns, or shortage are less favorable than those projected by us, or if sales of the merchandise inventory are more difficult than anticipated, additional merchandise inventory write downs may be required. Long lived assets. We record a long lived asset impairment charge when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based on estimated future cash flows. An impairment loss would be recognized if analysis of the undiscounted cash flow of an asset group was less than the carrying value of the asset group. If our actual results differ materially from projected results, an impairment charge may be required in the future. In the course of performing our annual analysis, we determined that no long lived asset impairment charge was required for fiscal 2011, 2010, or 2009. 27 Depreciation and amortization expense. Property and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset, typically ranging from five to 12 years for equipment and 20 to 40 years for land improvements and buildings. The cost of leasehold improvements is amortized over the lesser of the useful life of the asset or the applicable lease term. Lease accounting. When a lease contains rent holidays or requires fixed escalations of the minimum lease payments, we record rental expense on a straight line basis over the term of the lease and the difference between the average rental amount charged to expense and the amount payable under the lease is recorded as deferred rent. We begin recording rent expense on the lease possession date. Tenant improvement allowances are included in other long term liabilities and are amortized over the lease term. Changes in tenant improvement allowances are included as a component of operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Insurance obligations. We use a combination of insurance and self insurance for a number of risk management activities, including workers compensation, general liability, and employee related health care benefits. Our self insurance and deductible liability is determined actuarially, based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported. Should a greater amount of claims occur compared to what is estimated or the costs of medical care increase beyond what was anticipated, our recorded reserves may not be sufficient and additional charges could be required. Stock based compensation. We recognize compensation expense based upon the grant date fair value of all stock based awards. We use historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and to recognize stock based compensation expense. All stock based compensation awards are expensed over the service or performance periods of the awards. Income taxes. We account for our uncertain tax positions in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (ASC) 740. We are required to make assumptions and judgments regarding our income tax exposures. Our policy is to recognize interest and or penalties related to all tax positions in income tax expense. To the extent that accrued interest and penalties do not ultimately become payable, amounts accrued will be reduced and reflected as a reduction of the overall income tax provision in the period that such determination is made. The critical accounting policies noted above are not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies. In many cases, the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP), with no need for managements judgment in their application. There are also areas in which managements judgment in selecting one alternative accounting principle over another would not produce a materially different result. See our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto under Item 8 in this Annual Report on Form 10 K, which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by GAAP. Effects of inflation or deflation. We do not consider the effects of inflation or deflation to be material to our financial position and results of operations. New Accounting Pronouncements In May 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011 04, Fair Value Measurements (Topic 820): Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs, (ASU 2011 04). ASU 2011 04 changes the wording used to describe many of the requirements in U.S. GAAP for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurements to ensure consistency between U.S. GAAP and IFRS. ASU 2011 04 also expands the disclosures required for fair value measurements. ASU 2011 04 is to be applied prospectively and is effective for the Company in fiscal 2012. We believe adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2011, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2011 05, Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Presentation of Comprehensive Income, (ASU 2011 05). ASU 2011 05 eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity. ASU 2011 05 requires that all nonowner changes in stockholders equity be presented in either a single continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements. This new guidance is to be applied retrospectively and is effective for the Company in fiscal 2012. We believe the adoption of this guidance will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. 28 Forward Looking Statements Our Annual Report on Form 10 K for fiscal 2011, and information we provide in our Annual Report to Stockholders, press releases, telephonic reports, and other investor communications including those on our corporate website, may contain a number of forward looking statements regarding, without limitation, planned store growth, new markets, expected sales, projected earnings levels, capital expenditures, and other matters. These forward looking statements reflect our then current beliefs, projections, and estimates with respect to future events and our projected financial performance, operations, and competitive position. The words plan, expect, target, anticipate, estimate, believe, forecast, projected, guidance, looking ahead, and similar expressions identify forward looking statements. Future economic and industry trends that could potentially impact revenue, profitability, and growth remain difficult to predict. As a result, our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties which could cause our actual results to differ materially from those forward looking statements and our previous expectations and projections. Refer to Item 1A in this Annual Report on Form 10 K for a more complete discussion of risk factors for Ross and dds DISCOUNTS. The factors underlying our forecasts are dynamic and subject to change. As a result, any forecasts or forward looking statements speak only as of the date they are given and do not necessarily reflect our outlook at any other point in time. We disclaim any obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK. We are exposed to market risks, which primarily include changes in interest rates. We do not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes. We occasionally use forward contracts to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency prices. We had no outstanding forward contracts as of January 28, 2012. Interest that is payable on our revolving credit facility is based on variable interest rates and is, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. As of January 28, 2012, we had no borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility. In addition, lease payments under certain of our synthetic lease agreements are determined based on variable interest rates and are, therefore, affected by changes in market interest rates. In addition, we have two outstanding series of unsecured notes held by institutional investors: Series A for $85 million accrues interest at 6.38% and Series B for $65 million accrues interest at 6.53%. The amount outstanding under these notes as of January 28, 2012 was $150 million. Interest is receivable on our short and long term investments. Changes in interest rates may impact interest income recognized in the future, or the fair value of our investment portfolio. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase or decrease in prevailing market interest rates would not have materially impacted our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, or the fair values of our short and long term investments as of and for the year ended January 28, 2012. We do not consider the potential losses in future earnings and cash flows from reasonably possible, near term changes in interest rates to be material. 29
