ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CAPITALIZED TERMS HEREIN ARE DEFINED IN THE FOOTNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED HEREIN.) As described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, a restatement has been made to correct previously reported financial results. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally adopted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Application of certain of the Companys accounting policies, including those related to oil and gas revenues, bad debts, oil and gas properties, marketable securities, income taxes and contingencies and litigation require significant estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements. Proved oil and natural gas reserves Proved reserves are defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as those volumes of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Although the Companys engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves as established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires the engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revision, certain of which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. Changes in oil and natural gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions inherently lead to adjustments of depreciation rates utilized by the Company. The Company can not predict the types of reserve revisions that will be required in future periods. Successful efforts accounting The Company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures. Unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on operating results. Successful exploration drilling costs and all development capital expenditures are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and natural gas reserves as estimated by the Companys engineers. The Company also uses proved developed reserves to recognize expense for future estimated dismantlement and abandonment costs. Costs of exploration wells in progress at year end 2001 were not significant. Impairment of properties The Company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in Property, Plant and Equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheet to make sure that they are fairly presented. The Company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices, an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves that will be produced from a field, the timing of this future production, future costs to produce the oil and natural gas, and future inflation levels. The need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors, including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or natural gas, unfavorable adjustment to reserves, or other changes to contracts environmental regulations or tax laws. All of these same factors must be considered when testing a propertys carrying value for impairment. The Company can not predict the amount of impairment charges that may be recorded in the future. Income taxes The Company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required because: (a) income tax returns are generally filed months after the close of its calendar year; (b) tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities and audits can often take years to complete and settle; and (c) future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized by the Company. The Company has deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences. The Company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of their realization. A valuation allowance is recognized for deferred tax assets when management believes that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized. 25 The Companys deferred tax assets exceed deferred tax liabilities at year end 2001, before considering the effects of Other comprehensive income ("OCI"). In determining deferred tax liabilities, accounting rules require OCI to be considered, even though such income (loss) has not yet been earned. The inclusion of OCI causes deferred tax liabilities to exceed deferred tax assets by $4.5 million therefore, such amount is recorded as deferred tax liability at year end 2001 on the Companys balance sheet. The Company needs to earn approximately $34.8 million of pre tax income from the unrealized hedges included in OCI at year end before statutory taxes will be recorded on the income statement. Due to the complexity of the accounting rules regarding taxes, the timing of when the Company will record deferred taxes is uncertain. The Company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in its various income tax returns. Although the Company believes that it has adequate accruals for matters not resolved with various taxing authorities, gains or losses could occur in future years from changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters. Legal, environmental and other contingent matters A provision for legal, environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal, environmental and contingent matters. In addition, the Company often must estimate the amount of such losses. In many cases, managements judgment is based on interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or courts of law. The Companys management closely monitors known and potential legal, environmental and other contingent matters, and makes its best estimate of when the Company should record losses for these based on information available to the Company. Other significant accounting policies requiring estimates include the following: The Company recognizes revenues from the sale of products and services in the period delivered. Revenues at IPF are recognized as earned. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for specific receivables we judge unlikely to be collected. At IPF, all receivables are evaluated quarterly and provisions for uncollectible amounts are established. The Company records a write down of marketable securities when the decline in market value is considered to be other than temporary. Impairments are recorded when management believes that a propertys net book value is not recoverable based on current estimates of expected future cash flows. FACTORS AFFECTING FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES During 2001, the Company spent $89.4 million on development, exploration and acquisitions. Fixed income obligations including Trust Preferred and $2.03 Preferred, were reduced by $65.9 million. At December 31, 2001, the Company had $3.4 million in cash, total assets of $682.5 million and a debt (including Trust Preferred) to capitalization (including debt, deferred taxes and stockholders equity) ratio of 63%. Available borrowing capacity on the Companys bank lines at December 31, 2001 was $25.0 million on the Parent Facility, $25.0 million on the Great Lakes Facility and $11.2 million on the IPF Facility. Long term debt (including Trust Preferred) at December 31, 2001 totaled $392.2 million and included $95.0 million of borrowings under the Parent Facility, $75.0 million under the non recourse Great Lakes Facility, $23.8 million under the non recourse IPF Facility, $79.1 million of 8.75% Senior Subordinated Notes, $29.6 million of 6% Convertible Subordinated Debentures and $89.7 million of Trust Preferred. During 2001, 1.8 million shares of common stock were exchanged for $2.9 million of Trust Preferred, $3.4 million of 8.75% Senior Subordinated Notes and $5.7 million of 6% Debentures. In addition, $2.3 million of 6% Debentures, $42.5 million of 8.75% Senior Subordinated Notes and $50,000 of 5.75% Trust Preferred were repurchased. A $4.0 million extraordinary gain net of costs was recorded as the securities were retired at a discount. In addition, 767,000 shares of common stock were exchanged for $5.4 million of the $2.03 Preferred and the remaining were repurchased for $74,000. Since 1998, there have been 13.6 million shares of common stock exchanged for $85.4 million face value of debt and convertible preferred stock. The Company believes its capital resources are adequate to meet its requirements for at least the next twelve months. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and gas business. A material drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce its ability to fund capital expenditures, reduce debt and meet its financial obligations. In addition, the Companys high depletion, depreciation and amortization rate may make it difficult to remain profitable if oil and gas prices decline further. The Company operates in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the ability to acquire reserves on an attractive basis, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of oil and gas, the ability to sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive 26 nature of the industry. The Companys ability to expand its reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain planned capital expenditures. The following summarizes the Companys contractual obligations at December 31, 2001 and their future maturities (in thousands): Less than 1 3 After 1 Year Years 3 Years Total Long term debt $ $193,801* $198,430 $392,231 Non cancelable operating lease obligations 820 1,560 126 2,506 Total contractual cash obligations $ 820 $195,361 $198,556 $394,737 * Due at termination dates in each of the Companys credit facilities, which the Company expects to renew, but there is no assurance that can be accomplished. Total long term debt (including Trust Preferred) at December 31, 2001, was $392.2 million. Long term debt of $193.8 million was at floating interest rates. Included in long term debt was $198.4 million of debt securities which have fixed interest charges. The table below describes the Companys required annual fixed interest payments on these debt instruments (in thousands): Interest Annual Interest Maturity Security Amount Rate Interest Payable Dates 8.75% Sr. Sub. Notes $79,115 8.75% $6,900 January, July 2007 6% Debentures 29,575 6.00% 1,800 February, August 2007 5.75% Trust Preferred 89,740 5.75% 5,200 Feb., May, Aug., Nov. 2027 $198,430 $13,900 Cash Flow The Companys principal sources of cash are operating cash flow and bank borrowings. The Companys cash flow is highly dependent on oil and gas prices. The Company has entered into hedging agreements covering approximately 55%, 30%, 15%, and 5% of its anticipated production from proved reserves on an mcfe basis for 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Decreases in prices and lower production at certain properties reduced cash flow sharply in 1998 and early 1999 and resulted in the reduction of the Companys borrowing base. Simultaneously, the Company sharply reduced its development and exploration spending. While the $89.4 million of capital expenditures for 2001 were funded entirely with internal cash flow, the amount expended was not sufficient to replace production. The 2002 capital budget of $100.0 million is expected to increase production 5% or more and expand the reserve base by more than replacing production. The Companys hedge position is expected to allow the capital program to be funded with internal cash flow even in this low price environment. However, in such a low price environment, management expects little reduction in long term debt as excess internal cash flow will be limited. With any further decrease in product prices, it would be unlikely that the Company would be able to fund the $100.0 million capital program entirely from internal cash flow. The Company intends to closely monitor its capital expenditure program and results of operations in 2002; therefore, this current low price environment may negatively affect the amount of capital spending for the year. Net cash provided by operations in 1999, 2000 and 2001 was $50.2 million, $74.9 million and $129.6 million, respectively. Cash flow from operations increased as higher prices and lower interest expense more than offset increasing direct operating. Net cash used in (provided by) investing in 1999, 2000 and 2001 was $(98.2) million, $6.0 million and $78.2 million, respectively. In 1999, a $98.7 million source of cash from the formation of Great Lakes, $17.5 million in asset sales and $13.2 million of IPF receipts, more than offset additions to oil and gas properties and IPF investments. In 2000, $47.5 million of additions to oil and gas properties, offset by $25.9 million proceeds from sales of assets and $24.8 million of IPF repayments were included. The 2001 period included $87.0 million of additions to oil and gas properties and $11.6 million of IPF investments, partially offset by $19.0 million of IPF receipts and $3.8 million of asset sales. 27 Net cash used in financing in 1999, 2000 and 2001 was $146.4 million, $79.3 million and $50.6 million, respectively. Sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and debt offerings. During 2001, recourse debt increased by $5.1 million and total debt (including Trust Preferred) decreased by $65.9 million. The reduction in debt was the result of applying excess cash flow, proceeds from asset sales and from exchanges of common stock. During 2000, recourse debt decreased by $63.9 million and total debt (including Trust Preferred) decreased by $118.5 million. The reduction in debt was the result of applying excess cash flow and proceeds from the sale of assets to debt repayment and exchanges of common stock for fixed income securities. The amount of Trust Preferred outstanding decreased $2.3 million in 1999, $25.0 million in 2000 and $2.9 million in 2001 due primarily to exchanges of such securities into common stock. Capital Requirements During 2001, $89.4 million of capital was expended, primarily on development projects. This represented approximately 69% of internal cash flow. The Company manages its capital budget with the goal of funding it with internal cash flow. The 2002 capital budget of $100.0 million is expected to increase production 5% or more and expand the reserve base by more than replacing production. The Companys hedge position which covers approximately 55% of anticipated 2002 production from proved reserves, is expected to allow the capital program to be funded with internal cash flow even in this low price environment. However, in such a low price environment, management expects little reduction in long term debt as excess internal cash flow will be limited. With any further decrease in product prices, it would be unlikely that the Company would be able to fund the $100.0 million capital program entirely from internal cash flow. The Company intends to closely monitor the capital expenditure program and results of operations; therefore, this current low price environment may negatively affect the amount of capital spending for the year. Development and exploration activities are highly discretionary, and, for the foreseeable future, management expects such activities to be maintained at levels equal to or below internal cash flow. See "Business Development and Exploration Activities." Banking The Company maintains three separate revolving credit facilities: a $225.0 million facility at the parent company; a $100.0 million facility at IPF and a $275.0 million facility at Great Lakes. Each facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the borrower. The IPF and Great Lakes facilities are non recourse to Range. As Great Lakes is 50% owned, half of the borrowings on its facility are consolidated in Ranges financial statements. Availability under the facilities are subject to borrowing bases set by banks semi annually and in certain other circumstances. The borrowing bases are dependent on a number of factors, primarily the lenders assessment of future cash flows. Redeterminations require approval of 75% of the lenders, increases require unanimous approval. At March 1, 2002, there was availability under each of the Companys facilities. At the parent, a $120.0 million borrowing base was in effect of which $16.5 million was available. At IPF, a $35.0 million borrowing base was in effect of which $11.7 million was available. At Great Lakes, half of which is consolidated at Range, a $200.0 million borrowing base was in effect, of which $54.0 million was available. Hedging Oil and Gas Prices The Company regularly enters into hedging agreements to reduce the impact of fluctuations in oil and gas prices on its operations. The Companys current policy, when futures prices justify, is to hedge between 50% and 75% of projected production from existing proved reserves on a rolling twelve to eighteen month basis. At December 31, 2001, hedges were in place covering 47.3 Bcf of gas at prices averaging $4.02 per mcf and 700,000 barrels of oil averaging $25.97 per barrel. Their fair value, excluding hedge contracts with Enron North America Corp. ("Enron"), represented by the estimated amount that would be realized on termination, based on contract versus NYMEX prices, approximate a net unrealized pre tax gain of $52.1 million at December 31, 2001, respectively. The contracts expire monthly through December 2005 and cover approximately 55% of anticipated 2002 production from proved reserves and 30% of 2003 production from proved reserves and lesser amounts of 2004 and 2005 production. Gains or losses on open and closed hedging transactions are determined as the difference between the contract price and a reference price, generally closing prices on the NYMEX. Transaction gains and losses are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases on oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold. Any ineffective portion of such hedges is recognized in earnings as it occurs. Net pre tax losses relating to these derivatives in 1999, 2000 and 2001 were $10.6 million, $43.2 million and $6.2 million, respectively. Over the last three years, the Company has recorded cumulative net pre tax hedging losses of $60.0 million in income, which, when combined with the $52.1 million 28 unrealized pre tax gain at year end 2001, result in a cumulative net loss of $7.9 million. Effective January 1, 2001, the unrealized gains (losses) on these hedging positions are recorded at an estimate of fair value which the company bases on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX, on the Companys balance as OCI, a component of Stockholders Equity. The Company had hedge agreements with Enron for 22,700 Mmbtus per day, at $3.20 per Mmbtu for the first three months of 2002. Amounts due from Enron are not included in the open hedges described in the previous paragraph. Based on accounting regulations, the Company has recorded an allowance for bad debts at year end 2001 of $1.4 million, offset by a $318,000 ineffective gain included in 2001 income and $1.0 million gain included in OCI at year end 2001 related to these amounts due from Enron. The gain included in OCI at year end 2001 will be included in income in the first quarter of 2002. The last of the Enron contracts will expire as of March 2002. Interest Rates At December 31, 2001, Range had $392.2 million of debt (including Trust Preferred) outstanding. Of this amount, $198.4 million bears interest at fixed rates averaging 7.0%. Senior debt and non recourse debt totaling $193.8 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 4.0% at year end 2001, excluding interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2001, Great Lakes had $100.0 million of interest rate swap agreements, of which 50% is consolidated at Range. Two agreements totaling $45.0 million at rates of 7.1% each expire in May 2004. Two agreements of $10.0 million each at 6.2% in December 2002 and five agreements totaling $35.0 million at rates of 4.8%, 4.7%, 4.6%, 4.5%, and 4.5% expire in June 2003. The agreements expiring in May 2004 may be terminated at the counter partys option in May 2002. The 30 day LIBOR rate on December 31, 2001 was 1.9%. A 1% increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2001 would cost the Company approximately $1.4 million in additional annual interest, net of swaps. Capital Restructuring Program As described in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, the Company took a number of steps beginning in 1998 to strengthen its financial position. These steps included the sale of assets and the exchange of common stock for fixed income securities. These initiatives have helped reduce Parent company bank debt to $95.0 million and total debt (including Trust Preferred) to $392.2 million at December 31, 2001. While the Company believes its financial position has stabilized, management believes debt remains too high. To return to its historical posture of consistent profitability and growth, the Company believes it should further reduce debt. The Company currently believes it has sufficient liquidity and cash flow to meet its obligations for the next twelve months; however, a drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production or reserves would reduce the Companys ability to fund capital expenditures and meet its financial obligations. INFLATION AND CHANGES IN PRICES The Companys revenues, the value of its assets, its ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices. Oil and gas prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond the Companys ability to control or predict. During 2001, the Company received an average of $25.59 per barrel of oil and $3.65 per Mcf of gas after hedging. Although certain of the Companys costs and expenses are affected by the general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on the Company. However, industry specific inflationary pressures built up over an 18 month period in 2000 and 2001 due to favorable conditions in the industry. While product prices have recently declined, the cost of services in the oil and gas industry have not declined by the same percentage. Any increases in product prices could cause inflationary pressures specific to the industry to also increase. 29 RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following table identifies certain items included in the Companys results of operations and is presented to assist in comparison of the last three years. The table should be read in conjunction with the following discussions of results of operations. Year Ended December 31, 1999 2000 2001 (in thousands) Restated Restated Restated Increase/(Decrease) in Revenues: Writedown of marketable securities $ $ $ (1,715) Enron bad debt expense (1,352) Gain/(Loss) from asset sales (530) (1,116) 689 Effect of SFAS 133 2,351 Hedging gains (losses) (10,631) (43,187) (6,194) Gain on sale Great Lakes 30,929 $ 19,768 $(44,303) $ (6,221) Increase/(Decrease) in Expenses: Provision for impairment $ 29,901 $ $ 31,085 Mark to market non cash compensation expense 160 3,405 (2,410) Bad debt expense 615 688 Effect of SFAS 133 1,332 Adjustment of IPF valuation allowance 564 (2,891) 122 $ 30,625 $ 1,129 $ 30,817 Extraordinary Items: Gain on retirement of securities $ 2,430 $ 17,763 $ 3,951 Comparison of 2001 to 2000 Net income in 2001 totaled $17.7 million compared to $36.6 million in 2000. A $17.8 million gain on retirement of securities was realized in 2000 versus $4.0 million in 2001. The fourth quarter of 2001 included an impairment charge of $31.1 million. Production increased to 152.7 Mmcfe per day, a 1% increase from the prior year period. Revenues benefited from a 20% increase in average prices per mcfe to $3.75. The average prices received for oil increased 10% to $25.59 per barrel and for gas increased 26% to $3.65 per mcfe. Production expenses increased $2.9 million to $43.4 million as a result of higher production and property taxes, increased workover costs and slightly higher labor and services and supplies. Therefore, operating cost per mcfe produced averaged $0.78 in 2001 versus $0.73 in 2000. Transportation and processing revenues decreased 35% to $3.4 million due to the impact of the sale of a gas processing plant in June 2000 and lower NGL prices. IPFs $6.6 million of revenues declined 7% from 2000. IPF records income from payments on accounts with no reserve accrued against them. On accounts with reserves, IPF reduces the carrying value of the account for payments received and does not record income. Due to declining prices in 2001, less income was recorded from payments received. During 2001, IPF expenses included $1.8 million of administrative costs and $1.8 million of interest. In 2001, a favorable adjustment to IPF reserves of $1.8 million, due to favorable prices at the time, was more than offset by a year end increase in reserve for doubtful accounts of $2.0 million. During 2000, IPF expenses included $1.5 million of administrative costs and $3.4 million of interest costs. In 2000, a favorable adjustment of $1.3 million was recorded to IPF loss reserves and a favorable $1.6 million adjustment to the reserve for doubtful accounts. Exploration expense increased 84% to $5.9 million primarily due to additional seismic activity and increased personnel expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased 18% due to a decline in non cash mark to market compensation expense of $5.8 million offset by additional personnel costs ($1.4 million), higher legal and occupancy costs ($1.2 million) and additional costs ($600,000) incurred from having duplicate functions at Great Lakes and Range. The average number of general and administrative personnel increased 15% from 2000 to 2001. 30 Interest and other income increased from a loss of $722,000 in 2000 to a gain of $490,000 in 2001. The 2001 period included $2.3 million of ineffective hedging gains and a $689,000 gain on asset sales, partially offset by a $1.7 million writedown of marketable securities and a $1.4 million bad debt expense related to the Enron hedges. The 2000 period included $1.1 million loss on asset sales. Interest expense decreased 19% to $32.2 million primarily as a result of lower average outstanding balances and falling interest rates. Average outstandings on the Parent Facility were $124.7 million and $90.5 million for 2000 and 2001, respectively and the average interest rates were 8.8% and 6.4%, respectively. Depletion, depreciation and amortization ("DD&A") increased 16% to $77.6 million as a result of the mix of production between depletion pools and higher depletion rates. The per mcfe DD&A rate in 2001 was $1.39, a $0.18 increase from the $1.21 rate in 2000. The DD&A rate is determined based on ending reserves (valued at prices management believed appropriate at the time) and the net book value associated with them and to a lesser extent, depreciation on other assets owned at year end. The DD&A rate in the fourth quarter of 2001 was $1.60 per mcfe. The Company currently estimates that the consolidated DD&A rate for 2002 will approximate $1.38 per mcfe. The Company recorded a provision for impairment on acreage and proved properties for the year ended 2001. In evaluating possible impairment, the Company evaluates acreage on a separate basis from proved properties. Acreage. Acreage is assessed periodically to determine whether there has been a decline in value. If a decline is indicated, an impairment is recognized. The Company compares the carrying value of its properties to the assessment of value that could be recovered from sale, farm out or exploitation. The Company considers other additional information it believes is relevant in evaluating the properties fair value, such as geological assessment of the area, other acreage purchases in the area, timing of the associated drilling program or the properties uniqueness. The following acreage was impaired for the reasons indicated (in thousands): Reason for Impairment Acreage Pool Impairment Amount Matagorda Island 519 Probability of drilling reduced based on current assessment of risk and cost $1,704 East/West Cameron Condemned portion of leasehold through drilling or geologic assessment 708 Offshore Other Probability of drilling reduced based on current assessment of risk and cost 1,216 East Texas Condemned portion of leasehold through drilling 825 West Delta 30 Probability of drilling reduced based on current assessment of risk and cost 688 Total $5,141 Proved Properties. The impairment evaluation on proven properties is based on proved reserves. Estimated future cash flows include revenues from anticipated oil and production, severance taxes, direct operating expenses and capital costs. The following properties were impaired based upon an analysis of future cash flows (in thousands): Reason for Impairment Property Pool Impairment Amount Matagorda Island 519 Decline in gas price $ 14,401 Offshore Other Decline in gas price 3,302 Gulf Coast Onshore Decline in gas price 8,542 Oceana (GLEP) Decline in oil price 99 Total $ 25,944 Comparison of 2000 to 1999 Net income in 2000 totaled $36.6 million, compared to a net loss of $23.5 million in 1999. Production fell to 151,442 mcfe per day, a 17% decrease from 1999. A 4% decrease would have been reported if the effect of the Great Lakes transaction were eliminated. Revenues benefited from a 43% increase in average prices per mcfe to $3.12, partially offset by the production decrease. The average prices received for oil increased 58% to $23.30 per barrel and for gas increased 36% to $2.90 per Mcf. 31 Production expenses fell 6% to $40.6 million largely as a result of the Great Lakes transaction and asset sales. Operating costs per mcfe produced averaged $0.65 in 1999 versus $0.73 in 2000 due to higher production taxes and workovers. Transportation, processing and marketing revenues decreased 32% to $5.3 million as benefits of higher NGL prices were more than offset by the impact of the Sterling gas plant sale in April 2000. IPFs $7.2 million of revenues consisted of the return portion of its royalties. IPFs income declined 16% over that reported in 1999. During 2000, IPF expenses included $1.5 million of administrative costs, $3.4 million of interest, a $1.3 million favorable adjustment to IPF reserves and a $1.6 million favorable adjustment to the reserve for doubtful accounts. Exploration expense increased 32% to $3.2 million, primarily due to higher dry hole costs. General and administrative expenses increased 70% to $14.9 million. The increase was primarily due to an increase in non cash mark to market compensation expense of $3.2 million and lower recoupments from third parties for operations which fell due to the Great Lakes transaction, the expense of establishing duplicate financial and administrative departments in Fort Worth and higher bad debt expenses. Interest and other income decreased $1.1 million primarily due to $1.1 million of losses on sales of assets. Interest expense (excluding IPF) decreased 15% to $40.0 million primarily as a result of the lower outstandings, partially offset by higher interest rates. The average outstanding balance on the bank credit facility fell to $125 million from $308 million in the prior year and the weighted average interest rate rose from 7.1% to 8.8%. Depletion, depreciation and amortization ("DD&A") decreased 17% as a result of the mix of production by depletion pool and lower production. The Company wide DD&A rate was $1.21 per mcfe in 2000 compared to $1.21 in 1999. Acreage is assessed periodically to determine whether there has been an impairment. If an impairment is indicated, a loss is recognized. The Company compares the carrying value of its acreage to estimated fair value based on a variety of factors including the value that could be recovered from sale, farm out, or exploitation, a geological and engineering assessment, acreage transactions in the area, the timing of potential drilling and the nature of the specific property. In the fourth quarter of 2000, the Company raised its DD&A rate to $1.34 per mcfe to reflect a decline in proved reserves and the increased book value of properties subject to amortization. Reserves were revised downward in 2000 due to the removal of drilling and recompletion locations that, based on perceived risk, will probably not be drilled. See Note 22 to the financial statements. The Companys high DD&A rate will make it more difficult to remain profitable if commodity prices fall sharply. The Company recorded a provision for impairment on acreage ($6.1 million), proved properties ($2.8 million) and a gas plant ($21.0 million) for the year ended 1999. In evaluating possible impairment, the Company evaluates acreage on a separate basis from proved properties. 32 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about Ranges potential exposure to market risks. The term "market risk" refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward looking information provides indicators of how Range views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures. All of Ranges market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. Commodity Price Risk. Ranges major market risk is exposure to oil and gas pricing. Realized pricing is primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American gas production. Oil and gas prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. The Company periodically enters hedging arrangements with respect to oil and gas production of proved reserves. Pursuant to these swaps, Range receives a fixed price for its production and pays market prices to the contract counterparty. This hedging is intended to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations. Realized gains and losses are generally recognized in oil and gas revenues when the associated production occurs. Starting in 2001, gains or losses on open contracts are recorded either in current period income or Other comprehensive income ("OCI"). The gains and losses realized as a result of hedging are substantially offset in the cash market when the commodity is delivered. Range does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2001, Range had oil and gas hedges in place covering 47.3 Bcf of gas and 700,000 barrels of oil. Their fair value, excluding hedge contracts with Enron, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon termination, based on contract versus NYMEX prices, approximated a net unrealized pre tax gain of $52.1 million at December 31, 2001. These contracts expire monthly through December 2005 and cover approximately 55% of anticipated 2002 production from proved reserves and 30% of 2003 production from proved reserves and lesser amounts of 2004 and 2005 production. Gains or losses on open and closed hedging transactions are determined as the difference between the contract price and a reference price, generally closing prices on the NYMEX. Transaction gains and losses are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases to oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold. Any ineffective portion of such hedges is recognized in earnings as it occurs. Net pre tax losses relating to these derivatives in 1999, 2000 and 2001 were $10.6 million, $43.2 million and $6.2 million, respectively. Effective January 1, 2001, the unrealized gains (losses) on these hedging positions were recorded at an estimate of the fair value based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX, on the Companys balance sheet as OCI, a component of Stockholders Equity. The Company had hedge agreements with Enron for 22,700 Mmbtus per day, at $3.20 per Mmbtu for the first three months of 2002. Amounts due from Enron are not included in the open hedges described in the previous paragraph. Based on its accountants guidance, the Company has recorded an allowance for bad debts at year end 2001 of $1.4 million, offset by a $318,000 ineffective gain included in 2001 income and $1.0 million gain included in OCI at year end 2001 related to these amounts due from Enron. The gain included in OCI at year end 2001 will be included in income in the first quarter of 2002. The last of the Enron contracts will expire as of March 2002. In 2001, a 10% reduction in oil and gas prices, excluding amounts fixed through hedging transactions, would have reduced revenue by $4.4 million. If oil and gas future prices at December 31, 2001 had declined by 10%, the unrealized hedging gain at that date would have increased by $15.2 million. At December 31, 2001, Range had $392.2 million of debt (including Trust Preferred) outstanding. Of this amount, $198.4 million bears interest at fixed rates averaging 7.0%. Senior debt and non recourse debt totaling $193.8 million bears interest at floating rates, excluding interest rate swaps, which averaged 4.0% at that date. At December 31, 2001, Great Lakes had interest rate swap agreements totaling $100.0 million, 50% of which is consolidated with Range. Two agreements totaling $45.0 million at rates of 7.1% each expire in May 2004. Two agreements of $10.0 million each at 6.2% expire in December 2002 and five agreements totaling $35.0 million at rates of 4.8%, 4.7%, 4.6%, 4.5% and 4.5% expire in June 2003. The agreements expiring in May 2004 may be terminated at the counterpartys option in May 2002. On December 31, 2001, the 30 day LIBOR rate was 1.9%. A 1% increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding (net of amounts fixed through hedging transactions) at December 31, 2001 would cost the Company approximately $1.4 million in additional annual interest. 33
