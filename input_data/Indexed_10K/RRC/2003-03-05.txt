ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (CAPITALIZED TERMS HEREIN ARE DEFINED IN THE FOOTNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED HEREIN.) RESTATEMENT For many years, Arthur Andersen LLP served as the Companys auditor. In July 2002, the Company selected KPMG LLP as its new independent auditor. Simultaneously, the Company asked KPMG to reaudit its consolidated financial statements for the three years ended December 31, 2001, even though a reaudit was not required. The reaudit was intended to provide additional assurance to shareholders, ensure the Companys ongoing access to the capital markets and to avoid any possible impediment to future transactions. As a result of the reaudit, the financial statements were restated. For the three years ended December 31, 2001, the cumulative impact of the restatements reduced net income by $8.4 million, of which $7.8 million related to the reduction of the gain associated with the formation of Great Lakes in 1999. The restatement increased the 1999 net loss by $15.7 million, reduced 2000 net income by $1.4 million, increased 2001 net income by $8.7 million and reduced first half of 2002 net income by $2.3 million. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operation are based upon consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally adopted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Application of certain of the Companys accounting policies, including those related to oil and gas revenues, bad debts, the fair value of derivatives, oil and gas properties, marketable securities, income taxes and contingencies and litigation require significant estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements. Proved reserves Proved reserves are defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") as those volumes of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Although the Companys engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. Reserves estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each well. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revision, which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price changes and other economic factors. Changes in oil and gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions in turn cause adjustments in the depletion rates utilized by the Company. The Company cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods. Depletion rates are determined based on reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of producing properties. As the estimated reserves are adjusted, the depletion expense for a property will change, assuming no change in production volumes or the costs capitalized. Estimated reserves are used as the basis for calculating the expected future cash flows from a property, which are used to determine whether that property may be impaired. Reserves are also used to estimate the supplemental disclosure of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to its oil and gas producing activities and reserve quantities disclosure in Footnote 19 to the consolidated financial statements. Changes in the estimated reserves are considered changes in estimates for accounting purposes and are reflected on a prospective basis. Successful efforts accounting The Company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures. Unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on operating results. Successful exploration drilling costs and all development costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and gas reserves as estimated by the Companys engineers. The Company also uses proved developed reserves as the divisor to accrue the expense of estimated future dismantlement and abandonment costs. At year end, the Company had a liability totaling $32.1 million for plugging and abandonment costs on its balance sheet. This liability is shown netted against oil and gas properties on the balance 24 sheet. Currently, the Companys estimates it will spend $13.2 million over the next three years on plugging and abandonment costs. The Company will adopt SFAS 143 on January 1, 2003 which changes the accounting treatment for these types of costs. See Note 2 to the Consolidated financial statements "Recent Accounting Pronouncements" for further discussion. Impairment of properties The Company continually monitors its long lived assets recorded in Property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Balance sheet to ensure they are fairly presented. The Company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices, an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and gas reserves that will be produced from a field, the timing of future production, future production costs, and future inflation. The need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors, including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or gas, unfavorable adjustment to reserves, or other changes to contracts, environmental regulations or tax laws. All of these factors must be considered when testing a propertys carrying value for impairment. The Company cannot predict whether impairment charges may be required in the future. Income taxes The Company is subject to income and other similar taxes in all areas in which it operates. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required because: (a) income tax returns are generally filed many months after the close of a calendar year; (b) tax returns are subject to audit which can take years to complete; and (c) future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized. The Company has deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences. The Company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization. A valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when management believes that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized. The Companys deferred tax assets exceeded its deferred tax liabilities at year end 2001 before considering the effects of Other comprehensive income (loss) ("OCI"). In determining deferred tax liabilities, accounting rules require OCI to be considered, even though such income (loss) has not yet been earned. The inclusion of OCI caused deferred tax liabilities to exceed deferred tax assets by $4.5 million at year end 2001 and this amount was recorded as a deferred tax liability on the balance sheet. At year end 2002, deferred tax assets exceeded deferred tax liabilities by $15.8 million with $11.4 million of deferred tax assets related to deferred hedging losses included in OCI. Based on the Companys projected profitability, no valuation allowance was deemed necessary. The Company occasionally is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions on its various income tax returns. Although the Company believes that it has adequate accruals for unresolved tax matters, gains or losses could occur in the future due to changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters. Legal, environmental and other contingent matters A provision for legal, environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal, environmental and contingent matters. In addition, the Company often must estimate the amount of such losses. In many cases, managements judgment is based on an interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or the courts. Management closely monitors known and potential legal, environmental and other contingent matters and makes its best estimate of when the Company should record losses for these based on available information. Other significant accounting policies requiring estimates include the following: The Company recognizes revenues from the sale of products and services in the period delivered. Revenues at IPF are recognized as earned. We provide an allowance for doubtful accounts for specific receivables we judge unlikely to be collected. At IPF, all receivables are evaluated quarterly and provisions for uncollectible amounts are established. Such provisions for uncollectible amounts are recorded when management believes that a related receivable is not recoverable based on current estimates of expected discounted cash flows. The Company records a write down of marketable securities when the decline in market value is considered to be other than temporary. Changes in the value of the ineffective portion of all open hedges is recognized in earnings quarterly. The fair value of open hedging contracts is an estimated amount that could be realized upon termination. The Company stock held in the deferred compensation plan is treated as treasury stock and the carrying value of the deferred compensation is adjusted to fair value each reporting period by a charge or credit to operations in general and administrative expense. 25 FACTORS AFFECTING FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES During 2002, the Company spent $111.3 million on development, exploration and acquisitions. Fixed income obligations including Trust preferred were reduced by $24.2 million. At December 31, 2002, the Company had $1.3 million in cash, total assets of $658.5 million and a debt (including Trust preferred) to capitalization (including debt, deferred taxes and stockholders equity) ratio of 64%. Available borrowing capacity on the Companys bank lines at December 31, 2002 was $31.1 million on the Parent credit facility and $52.0 million at Great Lakes (of which $26.0 million was net to Range). Long term debt (including Trust preferred) at December 31, 2002 totaled $368.0 million and included $115.8 million of borrowings under the Parent credit facility, $76.5 million under the non recourse Great Lakes facility, $69.3 million of 8.75% Senior subordinated notes, $21.6 million of 6% Convertible subordinated debentures and $84.8 million of Trust preferred. At December 31, 2002, the Company had a working capital deficit of $29.8 million which included a net hedging liability of $26.0 million due to the mark to market of all open hedges. Because payments on this hedging liability are made monthly and the Company will also collect production proceeds to which this hedging relates, the amount should be self funding. During 2002, 1.6 million shares of common stock were exchanged for $2.4 million of Trust preferred, $875,000 of 8.75% Senior subordinated notes and $7.1 million of 6% Debentures. In addition, $815,000 of 6% Debentures, $9.0 million of 8.75% Senior subordinated notes and $2.5 million of 5.75% Trust preferred were repurchased for cash. A $3.1 million extraordinary gain ($2.0 million after tax) was recorded, as the securities were retired at a discount. Since 1998, 15.2 million shares of common stock have been exchanged for $95.8 million face value of debt and convertible preferred stock. The Company believes its capital resources are adequate to meet its requirements for at least the next 12 months. However, future cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and gas business. A material drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce the Companys ability to fund capital expenditures, reduce debt and meet financial obligations. In addition, the Companys high depletion, depreciation and amortization rate may make it difficult to remain profitable if oil and gas prices decline substantially. The Company operates in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the ability to acquire reserves on an attractive basis, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of oil and gas, the ability to sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. The Companys ability to expand its reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain planned capital expenditures. The following summarizes the Companys contractual financial obligations at December 31, 2002 and their future maturities (in thousands): Less than 1 3 After 1 Year Years 3 Years Total Long term debt $ $192,300(a) $175,741 $368,041 Non cancelable operating lease obligations 1,808 2,663 299 4,770 Total contractual cash obligations $ 1,808 $194,963 $176,040 $372,811 (a) Due at termination dates in each of the Companys credit facilities, which the Company expects to renew, but there is no assurance that can be accomplished. 26 Total long term debt (including Trust preferred) at December 31, 2002, was $368.0 million. Long term debt of $192.3 million was subject to floating interest rates (of which certain amounts have interest swap agreements) and $175.7 million of debt had a fixed interest rate. The table below describes the Companys required annual fixed interest payments on these debt instruments (in thousands): Annual Interest Security Amount Interest Payable Maturity 8.75% Sr. sub. notes $ 69,281 $ 6,062 January, July 2007 6% Debentures 21,620 1,297 February, August 2007 5.75% Trust preferred 84,840 4,878 Feb., May, Aug., Nov. 2027 $175,741 $ 12,237 Cash Flow The Companys principal sources of cash are operating cash flow and bank borrowings. The Companys cash flow is highly dependent on oil and gas prices. The Company has entered into hedging agreements covering approximately 90%, 75% and 10% of its anticipated production from proved reserves for 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Decreases in prices and lower production at certain properties reduced cash flow sharply in 1998 and 1999 and resulted in a reduction of the Companys borrowing base. Simultaneously, the Company sharply reduced its development and exploration spending. The $111.9 million of capital expenditures for 2002, excluding acquisitions was funded with internal cash flow. The amount expended replaced 222% of production. In the absence of price revisions, net reserves added during the year replaced 160% of production. The $105.0 million 2003 capital budget, which excludes acquisitions, is expected to increase production and to expand the reserve base. Based on current projections, oil and gas futures prices and the Companys hedge position, the 2003 capital program is expected to be funded with approximately 75% of internal cash flow. Net cash provided by operations in 2000, 2001 and 2002 was $74.9 million, $129.6 million, and $109.2 million respectively. In 2001, cash flow from operations increased as higher prices and lower interest expense more than offset increasing operating and exploration expenses. In 2002, cash flow from operations decreased with lower prices and volumes, higher exploration and general and administrative costs, somewhat offset by lower interest and direct operating costs. Net cash used in investing in 2000, 2001 and 2002 was $6.0 million, $78.2 million and $98.7 million respectively. In 2000, $47.5 million of additions to oil and gas properties were offset by $25.9 million proceeds from sales of assets and $24.8 million of IPF repayments. The 2001 period included $87.0 million of additions to oil and gas properties and $11.6 million of IPF investments, partially offset by $19.0 million of IPF receipts and $3.8 million of asset sales. The 2002 period included $109.1 million of additions to oil and gas properties and $5.1 million of IPF investments partially offset by $17.3 million of IPF receipts. Net cash used in financing (to repay debt) in 2000, 2001 and 2002 was $79.3 million, $50.6 million and $12.6 million respectively. Historically, sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and debt offerings. During 2000, recourse debt decreased $45.1 million and total debt (including Trust preferred) decreased $113.5 million. The reduction in debt was the result of applying excess internal cash flow and proceeds from asset sales to debt repayment and exchanges of common stock for fixed income securities. During 2001, recourse debt increased by $5.1 million and total debt (including Trust preferred) decreased by $65.9 million. The reduction in debt was the result of applying excess internal cash flow, proceeds from asset sales and exchanges of common stock for fixed income securities. During 2002, recourse debt increased $20.8 million and total debt (including Trust preferred) decreased by $24.2 million. Recourse debt increased due to the retirement of the IPF credit facility and the repurchase of fixed income securities with borrowing under the Parent credit facility. Capital Requirements During 2002, $111.9 million of capital was expended, primarily on development projects. The capital program, excluding acquisitions, was funded with approximately 83% of net cash flow from operations. The Company manages its capital budget with the goal of fully funding it with internal cash flow. The 2003 capital budget of $105.0 million is expected to increase production and expand the reserve base by more than replacing production. Development and exploration activities are highly discretionary, and, for the foreseeable future, management expects such activities to be maintained at levels equal to or below internal cash flow. See "Business Development and Exploration Activities." 27 Banking The Company maintains two separate revolving credit facilities, a $225.0 million Parent facility and a $275.0 million Great Lakes facility (of which 50% is consolidated at Range). In December 2002, the IPF credit facility was retired with borrowings under the Parent credit facility. Each facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the borrower. The Great Lakes facility is non recourse to Range. As Great Lakes is 50% owned, half of its borrowings are consolidated in Ranges financial statements. Availability under the facilities is subject to borrowing bases set by the banks semi annually and in certain other circumstances. The borrowing bases are dependent on a number of factors, primarily the lenders assessment of future cash flows. Redeterminations require approval of 75% of the lenders, increases require unanimous approval. At March 1, 2003, a $147.0 million borrowing base was in effect at Range of which $23.5 million was available and a $205.0 million borrowing base was in effect at Great Lakes, of which $44.0 million was available. HEDGING Oil and Gas Prices The Company regularly enters into hedging agreements to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations on its operations. The Companys current policy, when futures prices justify, is to hedge between 50% and 75% of projected production on a rolling 12 to 24 month basis. At December 31, 2002, hedges were in place covering 64.6 Bcf of gas at prices averaging $3.96 per mcf and 1.6 million barrels of oil at prices averaging $24.45 per barrel. The hedges fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination, based on contract versus NYMEX prices, approximated a pretax loss of $32.9 million at December 31, 2002. The contracts expire monthly through December 2005 and cover approximately 90% of anticipated 2003 production from proved reserves, 75% of 2004 production and a minor amount of 2005 production. Gains or losses on open and closed hedging transactions are determined as the difference between the contract price and a reference price, generally closing prices on the NYMEX. Transaction gains and losses are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases on oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold. Changes in the value of the ineffective portion of all open hedges is recognized in earnings quarterly. Pre tax losses relating to hedging in 2000 and 2001 were $43.2 million and $6.2 million, respectively. A hedging gain of $17.8 million was realized in 2002. Over the last three years, the Company has recorded a cumulative pre tax hedging loss of $31.6 million. When combined with the $32.9 million unrealized pre tax loss at year end 2002, this results in a cumulative net loss of $64.5 million. Since 2001, unrealized gains or losses on hedging positions are recorded at an estimate of fair value based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX, on the Companys Balance sheet as OCI, a component of Stockholders equity. Due to additional hedging activity and rising prices, the fair value on March 31, 2003 was a loss of $108.7 million. Interest Rates At December 31, 2002, the Company had $368.0 million of debt (including Trust preferred) outstanding. Of this amount, $175.7 million bears interest at fixed rates averaging 7.0%. Senior debt and non recourse debt totaling $192.3 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 3.3% at year end 2002, excluding interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2002, Great Lakes had $100.0 million subject to interest rate swap agreements, of which 50% is consolidated at Range. These swaps consist of five agreements totaling $35.0 million at an average rate of 4.6% which expire in June 2003, two agreements totaling $45.0 million at rates of 7.1% which expire in May 2004 and two agreements of $10.0 million each at an average rate of 2.3% which expire in December 2004. The 30 day LIBOR rate on December 31, 2002 was 1.4%. A 1% increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2002 would cost the Company approximately $1.4 million in additional annual interest, net of swaps. Capital Restructuring Program The Company took a number of steps beginning in 1998 to strengthen its financial position. These steps included the sale of assets and the exchange of common stock for fixed income securities. These initiatives have helped reduce Parent company bank debt to $115.8 million and total debt (including Trust preferred) to $368.0 million at December 31, 2002. While the Company believes its financial position has stabilized, management believes its leverage remains too high. The Company believes it should further reduce debt as a percentage of its capitalization. The Company currently believes it has sufficient liquidity and cash flow to meet its obligations for the next 12 months; however, a drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production or reserves would reduce the Companys ability to fund capital expenditures and meet its financial obligations. 28 INFLATION AND CHANGES IN PRICES The Companys revenues, the value of its assets, its ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices. Oil and gas prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond the Companys ability to control or predict. During 2002, the Company received an average of $22.25 per barrel of oil and $3.50 per mcf of gas after hedging. Although certain of the Companys costs and expenses are affected by the general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on the Company. However, industry specific inflationary pressures built up over an 18 month period in 2000 and 2001 due to favorable conditions in the industry. During 2002, the Company experienced a slight decline in certain drilling and operational costs when compared to the prior year. The Company expects an increase in these costs for 2003. Increases in commodity prices can cause inflationary pressures specific to the industry to also increase.

A $4.0 million gain on retirement of securities was realized in 2001 versus $2.0 million in 2002. The 2002 gain was net of deferred taxes of $1.1 million. Production decreased 2% to 150.1 Mmcfe per day due to lower production at Matagorda 519 and other production declines in the Gulf Coast. Revenues of $195.3 million were $24.1 million lower than 2001 due to the production decline and a 7% decrease in average prices to $3.49 per mcfe. The average prices received for oil decreased 13% to $22.25 per barrel and for gas decreased 4% to $3.50 per mcfe. Production expenses decreased $3.0 million to $40.4 million as a result of lower production and property taxes, and reduced workover costs in the Gulf of Mexico. Operating cost per mcfe produced averaged $0.74 in 2002 versus $0.78 in 2001. Transportation and processing revenues were about the same as 2001 at $3.5 million. IPFs $3.8 million of revenues declined 43% from 2001. IPF records income on payments received on transactions that do not have a valuation allowance. On accounts with a valuation allowance, IPF reduces the carrying value of the receivable. Due to a declining portfolio balance in 2001, less income was recorded from payments received. Due to a significantly lower portfolio balance in 2002, less income was again recorded. During 2001, IPF expenses included $1.8 million of administrative costs, $1.8 million of interest and a net unfavorable adjustment of $122,000 to IPF receivables, net. During 2002, IPF expenses included $1.7 million of administrative costs, $937,000 of interest costs and $4.2 million was added to its valuation allowances. Exploration expense increased 96% to $11.5 million in 2002 primarily due to higher dry hole cost, additional seismic purchases and personnel expenses. General and administrative expenses increased 41% due to an increase in non cash mark to market compensation expense ($3.4 million), additional personnel costs ($1.4 million), higher insurance costs ($233,000), higher legal and consulting costs ($317,000) offset by lower bad debt expenses. The average number of general and administrative personnel increased 12% between 2001 and 2002. Other income decreased from income of $490,000 in 2001 to a loss of $2.9 million in 2002. The 2001 period included $2.3 million of ineffective hedging gains and a $689,000 gain on asset sales, partially offset by a $1.7 million write down of marketable securities and a $1.4 million bad debt expense related to Enron hedges. The 2002 period included a $2.7 million ineffective loss and $1.2 million write down of marketable securities, offset by a $715,000 recovery on an arbitration. Interest expense decreased 28% to $23.2 million primarily as a result of lower debt balances and falling interest rates. Average outstandings on the Parent credit facility were $90.5 million and $105.3 million for 2001 and 2002, respectively, and the average interest rates were 6.4% and 3.4%, respectively. Depletion, depreciation and amortization ("DD&A") decreased 1% to $76.8 million as a result of lower production and the mix of production between depletion pools offset by higher depletion rates. The DD&A rate per mcfe in 2002 was $1.40, a $0.01 increase from 2001. The DD&A rate is determined based on year end reserves (based on NYMEX futures prices averaging $4.11 per mcf and $23.36 per barrel) and the net book value associated with them and to a lesser extent, depreciation on other assets owned. The DD&A rate in the fourth quarter of 2002 was $1.44 per mcfe, reflecting year end 2002 reserves. The Company currently estimates that the DD&A rate for 2003 will remain at roughly $1.44 per mcfe. The Company recorded a $31.1 million provision for impairment on acreage and proved properties at year end 2001. No impairment was recorded in 2002. Comparison of 2001 to 2000 Net income in 2001 totaled $17.7 million compared to $36.6 million in 2000. A $17.8 million gain on retirement of securities was realized in 2000 versus $4.0 million in 2001. The fourth quarter of 2001 included an impairment charge of $31.1 million. Production increased to 152.7 Mmcfe per day, a 1% increase from the prior year. Revenues benefited from a 20% increase in average prices to $3.75 per mcfe. The average price received for oil increased 10% to $25.59 per barrel and for gas increased 26% to $3.65 per mcfe. Production expenses increased $2.9 million to $43.4 million as a result of higher production and property taxes, increased workover costs and slightly higher costs for labor, services and supplies. Operating cost per mcfe produced averaged $0.78 in 2001 versus $0.73 in 2000. Transportation and processing revenues decreased 35% to $3.4 million due to the impact of the sale of a gas processing plant in mid 2000 and lower NGL prices. IPFs $6.6 million of revenues declined 7% from 2000. IPF records 31 income on payments for transactions that do not have a valuation allowance. On accounts with a valuation allowance, IPF reduces the carrying value of the receivable. Due to a declining portfolio balance in 2001, less income was recorded from payments received. During 2001, IPF expenses included $1.8 million of administrative costs and $1.8 million of interest. In 2001, a favorable adjustment to IPF reserves of $1.8 million, due to favorable prices early in the year, was more than offset by a year end increase in the valuation allowance of $2.0 million. During 2000, IPF expenses included $1.5 million of administrative costs and $3.4 million of interest costs. In 2000, a favorable adjustment of $2.9 million was recorded to IPF valuation allowances. Exploration expense increased 84% to $5.9 million primarily due to additional seismic activity and increased personnel expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased 18% due to a decline in non cash mark to market compensation expense of $5.8 million offset by additional personnel costs ($1.4 million), higher legal and occupancy costs ($1.2 million) and additional costs ($600,000) incurred from having duplicate functions at Great Lakes and Range. The average number of general and administrative personnel increased 15% from 2000 to 2001. Other income increased from a loss of $722,000 in 2000 to a gain of $490,000 in 2001. The 2001 period included $2.3 million of ineffective hedging gains and a $689,000 gain on asset sales, partially offset by a $1.7 million write down of marketable securities and a $1.4 million bad debt expense related to Enron hedges. The 2000 period included a $1.1 million loss on asset sales. Interest expense decreased 19% to $32.2 million primarily as a result of lower average outstanding balances and falling interest rates. Average outstandings on the Parent facility were $124.7 million and $90.5 million for 2000 and 2001, respectively, and the average interest rates were 8.8% and 6.4%, respectively. DD&A increased 16% to $77.6 million as a result of the mix of production between depletion pools and higher depletion rates. The DD&A rate per mcfe in 2001 was $1.39, an $0.18 increase from 2000. The DD&A rate is determined based on year end reserves (based on futures prices) and the net book value associated with them and to a lesser extent, depreciation on other assets owned. The DD&A rate in the fourth quarter of 2001 was $1.60 per mcfe. The Company recorded a provision for impairment on acreage of $5.1 million and proved properties for $25.9 million at year end 2001. In evaluating possible impairment, the Company evaluates acreage on a separate basis from proved properties. Acreage is assessed periodically to determine whether there has been a decline in value. If a decline is indicated, an impairment is recognized. The Company compares the carrying value of its acreage to the assessment of value that could be recovered from sale, farm out or exploitation. The Company considers other additional information it believes relevant in evaluating the properties fair value, such as geological assessment of the area, other acreage purchases in the area and the timing of associated drilling. The following acreage was impaired in 2001 for the reasons indicated (in thousands). Acreage Pool Reason for Impairment Amount Matagorda Island 519 Probability of drilling reduced based on current $1,704 assessment of risk and cost East/West Cameron Condemned portion of leasehold through drilling or 708 geologic assessment Offshore Other Probability of drilling reduced based on current 1,216 assessment of risk and cost East Texas Condemned portion of leasehold through drilling 825 West Delta 30 Probability of drilling reduced based on 688 current assessment of risk and cost Total $5,141 The impairment evaluation on proven properties is based on proved reserves and estimated future cash flows, including revenues from anticipated oil and gas production, severance taxes, direct operating expenses and capital costs. The following properties were impaired in 2001 based on analysis of future cash flows (in thousands): Property Pool Reason for Impairment Amount Matagorda Island 519 Decline in gas price $14,001 Offshore Other Decline in gas price 3,302 Gulf Coast Onshore Decline in gas price 8,542 Oceana Decline in oil price 99 Total $25,944 32 ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about the Companys potential exposure to market risks. The term "market risk" refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward looking information provides indicators of how the Companys views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures. All of the Companys market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. Commodity Price Risk. The Companys major market risk is exposure to oil and gas prices. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American gas production. Oil and gas prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. The Company periodically enters hedging arrangements with respect to oil and gas production from proved reserves. Pursuant to these swaps, Range receives a fixed price for its production and pays market prices to the counterparty. Hedging is intended to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations. Realized gains and losses are generally recognized in oil and gas revenues when the associated production occurs. Starting in 2001, gains or losses on open contracts are recorded either in current period income or Other comprehensive income ("OCI"). The gains and losses realized as a result of hedging are substantially offset in the cash market when the commodity is delivered. Range does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2002, Range had oil and gas hedges in place covering 64.6 Bcf of gas and 1.6 million barrels of oil. Their fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon termination, based on contract versus NYMEX prices, approximated a net pre tax loss of $32.9 million at that date. These contracts expire monthly through December 2005 and cover approximately 90%, 75% and 10% of anticipated production from proved reserves for 2003, 2004 and 2005, respectively. Gains or losses on open and closed hedging transactions are determined as the difference between the contract price and a reference price, generally closing prices on the NYMEX. Transaction gains and losses are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases to oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold. Any ineffective portion of such hedges is recognized in earnings as it occurs. Net pre tax losses relating to these derivatives in 2000 and 2001 were $43.2 million and $6.2 million, respectively. A gain of $17.8 million was recorded in 2002. Effective January 1, 2001, the unrealized gains (losses) on these hedging positions were recorded at an estimate of the fair value based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX, on the Companys Balance sheet as OCI, a component of Stockholders equity. The Company had hedge agreements with Enron for 22,700 Mmbtus per day, at $3.20 per Mmbtu for the first three contract months of 2002. Based on accounting requirements, the Company recorded an allowance for bad debts at year end 2001 of $1.4 million, offset by a $318,000 ineffective gain included in 2001 income and $1.0 million gain included in OCI at year end 2001 related to these amounts due from Enron. The gain included in OCI at year end 2001 was included in income in the first quarter of 2002. The last of the Enron contracts expired in March 2002. In 2002, a 10% reduction in oil and gas prices, excluding amounts fixed through hedging transactions, would have reduced revenue by $17.5 million. If oil and gas futures prices at December 31, 2002 had declined by 10%, the unrealized hedging loss at that date would have decreased 95% or $31.3 million. Interest Rate Risk. At December 31, 2002, the Company had $368.0 million of debt (including Trust preferred) outstanding. Of this amount, $175.7 million bears interest at fixed rates averaging 7.0%. Senior debt and non recourse debt totaling $192.3 million bears interest at floating rates, excluding interest rate swaps, which averaged 3.4% at that date. At December 31, 2002, Great Lakes had interest rate swap agreements totaling $100.0 million, 50% of which is consolidated by Range. Five agreements totaling $35.0 million at an average rate of 4.6% expire in June 2003. Two agreements totaling $45.0 million at rates of 7.1% expire in May 2004. Two agreements of $10.0 million each at 2.3% expire in December 2004. On December 31, 2002, the 30 day LIBOR rate was 1.4%. A 1% decrease in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding (net of amounts fixed through hedging transactions) at December 31, 2002 would cost the Company approximately $1.4 million in additional annual interest. 33
