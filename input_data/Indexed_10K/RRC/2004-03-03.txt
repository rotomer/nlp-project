ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Capitalized terms herein are defined in the footnotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements contained herein.) Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates The Companys discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally adopted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related footnote disclosures. Application of certain of the Companys accounting policies, including those related to oil and gas revenues, bad debts, the fair value of derivatives, oil and gas properties, asset retirement obligations, marketable securities, income taxes and contingencies and litigation require significant estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The Company believes the following critical accounting policies reflect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its financial statements. Property, Plant and Equipment Proved reserves are defined by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as those volumes of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Although the Companys engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. Reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revision, which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price and cost changes and other economic factors. Changes in oil and gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions in turn cause adjustments in the depletion rates utilized by the Company. The Company cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods. Reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by the Companys Vice President of Reservoir Engineering who reports directly to the Companys Chief Operating Officer. In addition, because substantially all of the Companys proved reserves are pledged as collateral for the Senior Credit Facility, the Companys estimates of proved reserves are reviewed twice annually by independent engineers on behalf of each of the eleven banks participating in the Senior Credit Facility. A similar reserve review is conducted by the banks participating in the Great Lakes debt facility. To further ensure the reliability of reserve estimates, the Company engages independent petroleum consultants to review the estimates of proved reserves. During 2003, 2002, and 2001, their review covered 87%, 84% and 82% of reserve value, respectively. The Company utilizes the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures. Unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on operating results. Successful exploration drilling costs and all development costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved oil and gas reserves as estimated by the Companys engineers. The successful efforts method inherently relies upon the estimation of proved reserves, which includes proved developed and proved undeveloped volumes. The Company adheres to statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 19 (SFAS 19) for recognizing any impairment of capitalized costs to unproved properties. The greatest portion of these costs generally relate to the acquisition of leasehold costs. The costs are capitalized and periodically evaluated as to recoverability, based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in business strategy employed by management. The Company considers a combination of time and geologic and engineering factors to evaluate the need for impairment of these costs. Unproved properties had a net book value of $12.2 million, $19.0 million and $25.7 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Depletion rates are determined based on reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of producing properties. As the estimated reserves are adjusted, the depletion expense for a property will change, assuming no change in production volumes or the costs capitalized. Estimated reserves are used as the basis for calculating the expected future cash flows from a property, which are used to determine whether that property may be impaired. Reserves are also used to estimate the supplemental disclosure of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to its oil and gas producing activities and reserve quantities disclosure in Note 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Changes in the estimated reserves are considered changes in estimates for accounting purposes and are reflected on a prospective basis. The Company monitors its long lived assets recorded in property, plant and equipment in the Consolidated Balance Sheet to ensure they are fairly presented. The Company must evaluate its properties for potential impairment when 27 Table of Contents circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices, an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and gas reserves that will be produced from a field, the timing of future production, future production costs, future abandonment costs, and future inflation. The need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors, including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or gas, unfavorable adjustment to reserves, a change in costs, or other changes to contracts, environmental regulations or tax laws. All of these factors must be considered when testing a propertys carrying value for impairment. The Company cannot predict whether impairment charges may be required in the future. Derivatives The Company uses commodity derivative contracts to manage its exposure to oil and gas price volatility. The Company accounts for its commodity derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133). Earnings are affected by the ineffective portion of a hedge contract (changes in realized prices that do not match the changes in the hedge price). Ineffective gains or losses are recorded in other revenue while the hedge contract is open and may increase or reverse until settlement of the contract. This may result in significant volatility to current period income. For derivatives qualifying as hedges, the effective portion of any changes in fair value is recognized in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income (OCI) and then reclassified to earnings when the transaction is consummated. This may result in significant volatility in stockholders equity. The fair value of open hedging contracts is an estimated amount that could be realized upon termination. The commodity derivatives used by the Company include commodity swaps and collars. While there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising prices may not be captured, management believes the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important. Among these benefits are: more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions, the flexibility to enter into long term projects requiring substantial committed capital, smoother and more efficient execution of the Companys ongoing development drilling and production enhancement programs, more consistent returns on invested capital, and better access to bank and other credit markets. Through Great Lakes, the Company also has interest rate swap agreements to protect against the volatility of variable interest rates under its credit facility. Asset Retirement Obligations The Company has significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. The Companys removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as well as regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. Asset retirement obligations are not unique to the Company or to the oil and gas industry and in 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, (SFAS 143). The Company adopted this statement effective January 1, 2003, as discussed in Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. SFAS 143 significantly changed the method of accruing for costs an entity is legally obligated to incur related to the retirement of fixed assets (asset retirement obligations or ARO). Primarily, the new statement requires the Company to record a separate liability for the discounted present value of the Companys asset retirement obligations, with an offsetting increase to the related oil and gas properties on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet. Inherent in the present value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate retirement costs, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of retirement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. In addition, increases in the discounted ARO liability resulting from the passage of time will be reflected as accretion expense in the Consolidated Statement of Operations. SFAS 143 required a cumulative adjustment to reflect the impact of implementing the statement had the rule been in effect since inception. The Company, therefore, calculated the cumulative accretion expense on the ARO liability and the cumulative depletion expense on the corresponding property balance. The sum of this cumulative expense was compared to 28 Table of Contents the depletion expense originally recorded. Because the historically recorded depletion expense was higher than the cumulative expense calculated under SFAS 143, the difference resulted in a $4.5 million gain, net of tax, which the Company recorded as cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on January 1, 2003. Deferred Taxes The Company is subject to income and other taxes in all areas in which it operates. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required because: (a) income tax returns are generally filed many months after the close of a calendar year; (b) tax returns are subject to audit which can take years to complete; and (c) future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized. The Company has deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carry forwards and other deductible differences. The Company routinely evaluates all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization. A valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when management believes that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized. In determining deferred tax liabilities, accounting rules require OCI to be considered, even though such income (loss) has not yet been earned. At year end 2002, deferred tax assets exceed deferred tax liabilities by $15.8 million with $11.4 million of deferred tax assets related to hedging losses included in OCI. At year end 2003, deferred tax assets exceeded deferred tax liabilities by $9.0 million with $24.6 million of deferred tax assets related to deferred hedging losses included in OCI. Based on the Companys projected profitability and because if prices remain constant, the unrealized hedging losses should be offset in the future by higher realization on our production, no year end 2003 valuation allowance was deemed necessary. The Company may be is challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions on its various income tax returns. Although the Company believes that it has adequate accruals for unresolved tax matters, gains or losses could occur in the future due to changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding matters. Contingent Liabilities A provision for legal, environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable, and the cost can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal, environmental and contingent matters. In addition, the Company often must estimate the amount of such losses. In many cases, managements judgment is based on the input of its legal advisors and on the interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or the courts. Management monitors known and potential legal, environmental and other contingent matters and makes its best estimate of when the Company should record losses for these based on available information. Bad Debt Expense The Company periodically assesses the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectability. At IPF, receivables are evaluated quarterly and provisions for uncollectible amounts are established. Such provisions for uncollectible amounts are recorded when management believes that a related receivable is not recoverable based on current estimates of expected discounted cash flows. Revenues The Company recognizes revenues from the sale of products and services in the period delivered. Revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our products. A substantial portion of production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of the Companys control. Imbalances in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas can have dramatic effects on prices. Political instability and availability of alternative fuels could impact worldwide supply, while economic factors can impact demand. At IPF, payments believed to relate to return are recognized as income. Other The Company records a write down of marketable securities when the decline in market value is considered to be other than temporary. Third party reimbursements for administrative overhead costs incurred by the Company in its role as operator of oil and gas properties are applied to reduce general and administrative expense. Salaries and other employment costs of those employees working on 29 Table of Contents the Companys exploration efforts are expensed as exploration expense. The Company does not capitalize general and administrative expenses or interest expense. Liquidity and Capital Resources During 2003, the Company spent $206.9 million on exploration, development and acquisitions. In December 2003, the Company purchased, with borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility, producing oil and gas properties in Sterling County, Texas for approximately $87.1 million (including $2.1 million of asset retirement obligations). Bank facility debt increased $55.9 million in 2003 while other debt (including Trust Preferred Securities) was reduced by $65.8 million. At December 31, 2003, the Company had $631,000 in cash, total assets of $830.0 million and a debt to capitalization ratio of 57%. Available borrowing capacity on the Companys bank lines at December 31, 2003 was $46.7 million on the Senior Credit Facility and $85.0 million at Great Lakes (of which $42.5 million was net to Range). Long term debt at December 31, 2003 totaled $358.2 million and included $178.2 million of borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility, $70.0 million under the non recourse Great Lakes $275.0 million secured revolving bank facility (the Great Lakes Credit Facility), $98.3 million of 7.375% Notes and $11.6 million of 6% Debentures. At December 31, 2003, the Company had a working capital deficit of $40.9 million which included an unrealized hedging liability of $54.2 million due to the mark to market of all open hedges. Because payments on this hedging liability are made monthly, and the Company will also collect production proceeds to which this hedging relates and the amount should be self funding. During 2003, 129,000 shares of common stock were exchanged for $880,000 of 6% Debentures. A conversion expense of $465,000 was recorded on the exchange. In addition, $9.1 million of 6% Debentures, $5.3 million of Trust Preferred Securities and $500,000 of 8.75% Notes were repurchased for cash. Also, $10.2 million of cash and $50.0 million of the newly issued Convertible Preferred was exchanged for $79.5 million of Trust Preferred Securities. A $19.0 million gain was recorded, as the securities were retired at a discount. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves which is typical in the capital intensive extractive industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. The Company believes that net cash generated from operating activities and unused committed borrowing capacity under the credit facilities combined with the oil and gas price hedges currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near term financial obligations and liquidity needs. However, long term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and gas business. A material drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce the Companys ability to fund capital expenditures, reduce debt, meet financial obligations and remain profitable. The Company operates in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of oil and gas, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. The Companys ability to expand its reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures. The following summarizes the Companys contractual financial obligations at December 31, 2003 and their future maturities. The Company expects to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities and refinancing proceeds. 30 Table of Contents Payment due by period 2004 2005 and 2006 2007 and 2008 Thereafter Total (in thousands) Long term debt(a) $ $ $ 259,849 $ 100,000 $ 359,849 Operating leases 2,567 3,747 699 7,013 Seismic purchase 1,236 215 1,451 Derivative obligations(b) 54,229 16,777 71,006 Asset retirement obligation liability 5,814 19,098 3,540 23,391 51,843 Total contractual obligations(c) $ 63,846 $ 39,837 $ 264,088 $ 123,391 $ 491,162 (a) Due at termination dates for each of the Companys credit facilities, which the Company expects to renew, but there is no assurance that can be accomplished. (b) Derivative obligations represent net open hedging contracts valued as of December 31, 2003. (c) This table does not include the liability for the deferred compensation plan since these obligations will be funded with existing plan assets. Total long term debt at December 31, 2003, was $358.2 million. Long term debt of $248.2 million was subject to floating interest rates (of which certain amounts have interest swap agreements) and $111.6 million of debt had a fixed interest rate. The table below describes the Companys required annual fixed interest payments on these debt instruments (in thousands): Annual Interest Security Amount Interest Payable Maturity 7.375% Notes $ 100,000 $ 7,375 January, July 2013 6% Debentures 11,649 699 February, August 2007 $ 111,649 $ 8,074 Cash Dividend Payments In December 2003, the Company announced it would reinstate cash dividends on its common stock at an initial quarterly dividend rate of one cent per share. The first dividend was paid on January 30, 2004. The Convertible Preferred is entitled to receive cumulative quarterly dividends at an annual rate of $2.95 per share. The payment of dividends is subject to declaration by the Board of Directors and depends on earnings, capital expenditures and various other factors. The table below describes the Companys preferred dividend payments (in thousands): Annual Dividend Security Amount Dividend Payable 5.90% Convertible Preferred $ 50,000 $ 2,950 Quarterly 31 Table of Contents Cash Flow The Companys principal sources of cash are operating cash flow, bank borrowings and at times, issuance of debt and equity securities. The Companys cash flow is highly dependent on oil and gas prices. As of December 31, 2003, the Company has entered into hedging agreements covering 50.1 Bcfe, 28.9 Bcfe and 0.6 Bcfe for 2004, 2005 and 2006, respectively. The $106.0 million of capital expenditures for 2003, excluding acquisitions, was funded with internal cash flow. The amount expended replaced 130% of production. Including acquisitions, reserve replacement totaled 286% of production. The $126.0 million 2004 capital budget, which excludes acquisitions, is expected to increase production and to expand the reserve base. Based on current projections, oil and gas futures prices and the Companys hedge position, the 2004 capital program is expected to be funded with internal cash flow. Net cash provided by operations in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $125.5 million, $114.5 million and $130.6 million respectively. In 2003, cash flow from operations increased with higher volumes and higher prices somewhat offset by increasing operating and exploration expenses. In 2002, cash flow from operations decreased due to lower prices and volumes, higher exploration and higher general and administrative expenses. This decrease was somewhat offset by lower interest and direct operating expenses. In 2001, cash flow from operations increased with higher prices and lower interest expense somewhat offset by increasing operating and exploration expenses. Net cash used in investing in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $187.6 million, $103.9 million and $79.2 million, respectively. The 2003 period included $92.0 million additions to oil and gas properties, and $103.9 million of acquisitions, partially offset by $12.1 million of IPF receipts. The 2002 period included $92.6 million of additions to oil and gas properties and $5.1 million of IPF investments partially offset by $17.3 million of IPF receipts. The 2001 period included $78.5 million of additions to oil and gas properties and $11.6 million of IPF investments, partially offset by $19.0 million of IPF receipts and $3.8 million of asset sales. Net cash used in financing (to repay debt) in 2003, 2002 and 2001 was $61.5 million, ($12.6 million) and ($50.6 million), respectively. Historically, sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and debt offerings. During 2003, recourse bank debt increased $62.4 million primarily due to the December acquisition of producing properties in the Conger field. For the year, total debt declined $9.9 million. During 2003, the Company redeemed $84.8 million of the Trust Preferred Securities and $69.3 million of the 8.75% Notes and issued $100.0 million of 7.375% Notes. During 2002, recourse bank debt increased $20.8 million and total debt (including Trust Preferred Securities) decreased by $24.2 million. Recourse debt increased due to the retirement of the IPF credit facility and the repurchase of debt and convertible securities with borrowings under the Senior Credit Facility. During 2001, recourse bank debt increased by $5.1 million and total debt (including Trust Preferred Securities) decreased by $65.9 million. The reduction in debt was the result of applying excess internal cash flow, proceeds from asset sales and exchanges of common stock for debt and convertible securities. Capital Requirements The Companys primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends. During 2003, $106.0 million of capital was expended, primarily on drilling projects. Also during 2003, $100.9 million was expended on acquisitions, including $90.7 million to purchase producing properties. The capital program, excluding acquisitions, was funded by of net cash flow from operations. The 2004 capital budget of $126.0 million is expected to increase production and expand the reserve base by more than replacing production. Development and exploration activities are highly discretionary, and, for the foreseeable future, management expects such activities to be maintained at levels equal to or below internal cash flow. To the extent capital requirements exceed internal cash flow, debt or equity may be issued to fund these requirements. 32 Table of Contents Bank Credit Facilities The Company maintains two separate revolving credit facilities, a $225.0 million Senior Credit Facility and a $275.0 million Great Lakes Credit Facility (of which 50% is consolidated by the Company). Each facility is secured by substantially all the borrowers assets and matures on January 1, 2007. The Great Lakes Credit Facility is non recourse to the Company. As Great Lakes is 50% owned, half of its borrowings are consolidated in the Companys financial statements. Availability under the facilities is subject to borrowing bases set by the banks semi annually and in certain other circumstances. The borrowing bases are dependent on a number of factors, primarily the lenders assessment of future cash flows. Redeterminations of the borrowing base require approval of 75% of the lenders; increases require unanimous approval. At February 26, 2004, the Senior Credit Facility had a $225.0 million borrowing base of which $42.4 million was available. The Great Lakes Credit Facility, half of which is consolidated by the Company, had a $225.0 million borrowing base of which $82.0 million was available. Restrictions on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments as defined are imposed under the Companys bank credit agreement and the 7.375% Notes. Under the Senior Credit Facility, common and preferred dividends are permitted. The terms of the 7.375% Notes limit restricted payments (including dividends) to the greater of $20.0 million or a formula based on earnings since the issuance of the notes. The Senior Credit Facility provides for a restricted payment basket of $20.0 million plus 50% of net income (excluding Great Lakes) plus 66 2/3% of distributions, dividends or payments of debt from or proceeds from sales of equity interests of Great Lakes plus 66 2/3% of net cash proceeds from common stock issuances. The debt agreements contain covenants relating to net worth, working capital, dividends and financial ratios. The Company was in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2003. Hedging Oil and Gas Prices The Company enters into hedging agreements to reduce the impact of oil and gas price volatility on its operations. At December 31, 2003, hedges were in place covering 52.6 Bcf of gas at prices averaging $4.13 per mcf, 1.4 million barrels of oil at prices averaging $25.74 per barrel and 0.7 million barrels of NGLs at prices averaging $21.02 per barrel. The Company also has collars covering 6.6 Bcf of gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of $4.14 to $6.19 and 1.2 million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of $24.16 to $29.24. The hedges fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination, based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX, approximated a pretax loss of $70.6 million at December 31, 2003. The contracts expire monthly through December 2006. Transaction gains and losses are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases on oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold. Realized losses relating to hedging in 2001 were $6.2 million. A hedging gain of $17.8 million was realized in 2002. A hedging loss of $60.4 million was realized in 2003. Changes in the value of the ineffective portion of all open hedges are recognized in earnings quarterly in other income. Since 2001, unrealized gains or losses on hedging positions are recorded at an estimate of fair value based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX, on the Companys Consolidated Balance Sheet as OCI, a component of stockholders equity. At December 31, 2003, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding: Volume Average Hedge Contract Type Period Hedged Price Natural gas Swaps 2004 91,440 MMBtu/day $4.08 Swaps 2005 50,695 MMBtu/day $4.21 Swaps 2006 1,644 MMBtu/day $4.80 Collars 2004 6,470 MMBtu/day $4.38 $6.19 Collars 2005 11,517 MMBtu/day $4.14 $5.80 Crude oil Swaps 2004 3,010 Bbl/day $25.93 Swaps 2005 940 Bbl/day $25.11 Collars 2004 2,128 Bbl/day $24.18 $29.24 Collars 2005 1,233 Bbl/day $24.16 $27.48 Natural gas liquids Swaps 2004 1,377 Bbl/day $21.88 Swaps 2005 658 Bbl/day $19.20 33 Table of Contents Interest Rates At December 31, 2003, the Company had $358.2 million of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $110.0 million bears interest at fixed rates averaging 7.2%. Senior debt and non recourse debt totaling $248.2 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 3.1% at year end 2003, excluding interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2003, Great Lakes had $110.0 million subject to interest rate swap agreements, of which 50% is consolidated by the Company. These swaps consist of two agreements totaling $45.0 million at 7.1% which expire in May 2004, two agreements totaling $20.0 million at 2.3% which expire in December 2004, one agreement for $10.0 million at 1.4% which expires in June 2005 and two agreements totaling $35.0 million at 1.8% which expire in June 2006. The 30 day LIBOR rate on December 31, 2003 was 1.1%. A 1% increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2003 would cost the Company approximately $1.9 million in additional annual interest, net of swaps. Capital Restructuring Program The Company took a number of steps beginning in 1998 to strengthen its financial position. These steps included the sale of assets and the exchange of common stock for debt and convertible securities. These initiatives have helped reduce total debt 51% from $727.2 million at December 31, 1998 to $358.2 million at December 31, 2003. The Company currently believes it has sufficient liquidity and cash flow to meet its obligations for the next twelve months; however, a drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production or reserves would reduce the Companys ability to fund capital expenditures and meet its financial obligations. Also, the Companys obligations may change due to acquisitions, divestitures and continued growth. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material to its financial position or results of operations. Inflation and Changes in Prices The Companys revenues, the value of its assets, its ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices. Oil and gas prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond the Companys ability to control or predict. During 2002, the Company received an average of $22.25 per barrel of oil and $3.50 per mcf of gas after hedging. During 2003, the Company received an average of $23.53 per barrel of oil and $3.94 per mcf of gas, after hedging. Although certain of the Companys costs and expenses are affected by the general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on the Company. However, industry specific inflationary pressures built up over an 18 month period in 2001 and 2002 due to favorable conditions in the industry. During 2002, the Company experienced a slight decline in certain drilling and operational costs when compared to the prior year and in 2003 there were slight increases in these costs. The Company expects an increase in these costs for 2004. Increases in commodity prices can cause inflationary pressures specific to the industry to also increase. Future Trends The Companys strategy is to increase its oil and gas reserves, production, cash flow and earnings per share through a balanced program that involves: enhancing and increasing the base of existing properties; developing existing acreage position; investing in high potential exploration prospects; and acquiring producing properties complementary to existing properties. The Company has announced a $126.0 million 2004 capital budget excluding acquisitions. Range will continue to monitor commodity prices and adjust its capital expenditures accordingly. The Company will also continue to evaluate and pursue acquisition opportunities should they become available at reasonable prices. A major trend over the past two decades has involved the divestiture of oil and gas properties located in the United States by major integrated oil companies and large independents. These companies have largely pursued growth internationally to achieve the size and economies of scale required of a large global enterprise and have sold or deemphasized older smaller properties in the United States. Many of these divested properties have not received significant recent capital 34 Table of Contents investment and often newly available production and reserve enhancement technology has not been applied to these properties. In other situations, to increase cash flow without increasing capital spending, companies have allowed smaller firms such as Range the opportunity to explore and develop reserves on their undeveloped acreage through joint ventures. The pace of these initiatives by the large independents and major integrated oil companies has slowed significantly during the past five years as oil and gas price increases have improved the underlying economics of older properties. It is anticipated that as oil and gas prices plateau or decline and extraction costs continue to rise, larger oil companies will implement additional property divestitures and entertain additional joint ventures. This trend would increase the availability of acquisition, exploration and development opportunities for the Company. Should this trend not continue, the Company will continue to rely upon the ability of its technical teams to generate exploration and development prospects on existing Company owned acreage and acreage publicly available for lease. Another major trend in the industry involves technological advances that reduce the cost to explore and produce oil and gas and also allow for extraction of oil and gas from reservoirs previously deemed unrecoverable. Examples of this technology include 3 D seismic, hydraulic reservoir fracture stimulation, advances in well logging and analysis, horizontal drilling and completion techniques, secondary and tertiary recovery practices, and automated well monitoring and control devices. These technology advances have served to lower exploration risk, reduce drilling and production costs and, on occasion, dramatically increase the amount of economically recoverable oil and gas reserves from existing reservoirs. While it is impossible to predict the continuation, pace and application of this trend to the Companys properties, the Companys large acreage position, experienced staff and geographically diversified property base, positions the Company well for future technological advances. 35 Table of Contents Results of Operations Volumes and Sales Data 2003 2002 2001 Production: Crude oil (bbls) 2,023,158 1,872,654 1,916,073 NGLs (bbls) 400,631 406,746 325,803 Natural gas (mcfs) 43,510,180 41,095,976 42,278,430 Total (mcfe) 58,052,911 54,772,376 55,729,683 Average daily production: Crude oil (bbls) 5,543 5,131 5,250 NGLs (bbls) 1,098 1,114 893 Natural gas (mcfs) 119,206 112,592 115,831 Total (mcfe) 159,049 150,061 152,684 Average sales prices (excluding hedging): Crude oil (per bbl) $ 28.42 $ 23.34 $ 23.34 NGLs (per bbl) $ 18.75 $ 12.93 $ 17.33 Natural gas (per mcf) $ 5.10 $ 3.02 $ 3.91 Total (per mcfe) $ 4.94 $ 3.16 $ 3.87 Average sales prices (including hedging): Crude oil (per bbl) $ 23.53 $ 22.25 $ 25.55 NGLs (per bbl) $ 18.75 $ 12.93 $ 17.33 Natural gas (per mcf) $ 3.94 $ 3.50 $ 3.66 Total (per mcfe) $ 3.90 $ 3.49 $ 3.75 The following table identifies certain items included in the results of operation and is presented to assist in comparing results of the last three years.

As in any commodity business, the market price of the commodity produced and the costs associated with finding, acquiring, extracting, and financing the operation are critical to profitability and long term value creation for shareholders. Generating growth while containing costs represents an ongoing challenge for management, made particularly urgent by the natural production and reserve decline associated with oil and gas properties. During periods of historically high oil and gas prices, cost increases are more prevalent due to increased competition for goods and services. Other challenges faced by the Company include attracting and retaining qualified personnel and maintaining access to capital on sufficiently favorable terms. Enrollments in university oil and gas technology programs have declined over the past two decades as the industry has been wracked by business cycles and consolidation. Emerging industries, such as high technology, have increased the competition for favorably priced capital required by the oil and gas industry. The Company has responded to these trends and challenges in many ways. The balance sheet has been restructured to increase cash flow available for investment through reduced debt, principal maturity extensions, and lower interest expense. The technical staff of the Company has been increased and strengthened through the hiring of additional experienced professionals and the use of teams. The inventory of exploration and development prospects has been increased to provide greater diversification of technical risk and better efficiency. The Companys multidiscipline technical teams have local expertise in their area of operation. This technical competence and local expertise provides a platform to compete and grow core areas from exploration, development and acquisitions. The year ended December 31, 2003 was very good operationally. Production for the Company increased 6% versus the prior year. Range replaced 286% of production at $1.25 per Mcfe finding and development costs through a combination of both successful drilling and acquisition programs. The 286% production replacement caused the Companys reserve base to increase 18% to 685 Bcfe as of December 31, 2003. The Company completed the acquisition of producing properties in the Conger Field in Sterling County, Texas on December 23, 2003. With this acquisition, the Company became the largest operator in the field with current net production of 32 Mmcfe per day and an acreage position of 69,000 gross acres. As a result of this acquisition, coupled with our ongoing drilling program, 2004 production is projected to increase over 2003. The drilling inventory consists of a large number of low risk locations, coupled with projects that have higher risk and have the potential to positively impact the Companys reserves and production if successful. The inventory is also geographically diversified with projects in each of the three core areas: Southwest, Gulf Coast, and Appalachia. Our strategy calls for our baseline growth to be generated through drilling and for the acquisition of producing properties to provide incremental growth. Comparison of 2003 to 2002 The year 2003 brought favorable operating and financial results, even though the Company realized a $60.4 million reduction in oil and gas revenue due to oil and gas hedging. On the operating side, oil and gas prices, production and proved reserves were all higher than 2002. A complementary acquisition adjacent to an existing Company owned property was completed in December 2003. With the transition from an acquisition focused strategy to a drilling based strategy coupled with complementary acquisitions, 2003 brought an increase in both acreage and seismic spending. On the financial side, enhancing the Companys financial position continued with retirement of the Trust Preferred Securities, refinancing of the 8.75% Notes, and a sizable proved reserve driven increase in the Senior Credit Facility borrowing base. Debt carrying costs were reduced and maturities extended, increasing cash flow available for capital investment. The balance sheet enhancement also resulted in several large revenue and expense items related to the various transactions. Net income in 2003 totaled $35.4 million compared to $25.8 million in 2002. A $19.0 million gain on retirement of debt and convertible securities was realized in 2003 versus $3.1 million in 2002. Total oil and gas revenues of $226.4 million were $35.4 million higher than 2002 due to 6% higher production and a 12% increase in average prices to $3.90 per mcfe. The average prices received for oil increased 6% to $23.53 per barrel and increased 13% to $3.94 per mcf for gas. Production expenses increased $4.5 million to $36.4 million as a result of higher workover costs and increased costs from acquisitions and new wells. Production taxes increased $4.3 million to $12.9 million due to higher prices and higher volumes. Since production taxes are paid based on market prices and not hedged prices, higher 37 Table of Contents market prices caused production taxes per mcfe to increase 38% from the prior year. Operating cost (excluding production and ad valorem taxes) per mcfe produced averaged $0.63 in 2003 versus $0.58 in 2002. Transportation and gathering revenues of $3.5 million were approximately the same as 2002. IPFs income of $1.5 million declined 59% from 2002 due to a declining portfolio balance. During 2003, IPF expenses included $1.0 million of administrative expenses, $207,000 of interest and a $1.7 million increase in the valuation allowance. During 2002, IPF expense included $1.7 million of administrative costs, $937,000 of interest costs and a $4.2 million increase to the valuation allowance. Other revenue increased from a loss of $2.9 million in 2002 to a loss of $1.3 million in 2003. The 2003 period included $1.2 million of ineffective hedging losses. The 2002 period included $2.7 million ineffective hedging losses and a $1.2 million write down of marketable securities, offset by a $715,000 arbitration recovery. Exploration expense increased 21% to $13.9 million in 2003 primarily due to higher seismic purchases ($3.9 million) offset by lower dry hole costs ($1.7 million). General and administrative expenses increased 41% due to a $5.5 million increase in the non cash mark to market deferred compensation expense and $1.6 million of higher salary and related benefit costs as well as higher director fees, legal and consulting fees and insurance costs. Interest expense for 2003 decreased 4% to $22.2 million with the $2.0 million call premium on the 8.75% Notes (included in interest expense) offset by lower outstanding debt and lower interest rates. Average debt outstanding on the Senior Credit Facility was $104.7 million and $105.3 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively and the average interest rates were 3.1% and 3.4%, respectively. Depletion, depreciation and amortization increased 13% to $86.5 million due to higher production, an additional $4.5 million of accretion expense related to the adoption of the new accounting principle for abandonment costs and higher amortization of unproved property costs. The per mcfe DDA rate was $1.49, a $0.09 increase from 2002 with higher accretion expense ($0.08 per mcfe) and higher amortization of unproved property ($0.03 per mcfe). The DDA rate is determined based on year end reserves (based on NYMEX futures prices averaging $32.52 per barrel and $6.19 per mcf) and the net book value associated with them and, to a lesser extent, depreciation on other assets owned. The DDA rate in the fourth quarter of 2003 was $1.48 per mcfe, reflecting year end 2003 reserves. Year end 2003 includes a tax expense of $18.5 million versus a tax benefit of $3.4 million in the prior year. The prior year included a reversal of a valuation allowance as an $11.2 million reduction of 2002 income tax expense. Year end 2003 provides tax expense at a rate of 37%. The Company adopted the provisions of SFAS 143 on January 1, 2003 and recognized a $4.5 million benefit from the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of $2.4 million of taxes. Comparison of 2002 to 2001 The operating and financial enhancement of the Company continued in 2002 resulting in a transition year. While net income was higher in 2002 than in 2001, this increase was primarily due to an asset impairment taken in 2001. Production volume was down slightly in 2002 and both oil and gas prices were below 2001 levels. Various expense categories, including general and administrative expenses, were higher in 2002 as the Company continued to place greater emphasis on internally generated growth through development and exploration as opposed to primary reliance upon acquisitions. Generally, growth through acquisitions requires higher general and administrative expense after the acquired production volumes are evident while internal growth through drilling activities require higher general and administrative expenses before incremental production volumes are evident. The key personnel changes and additions made in 2002, combined with higher expenditures for acreage and seismic, is expected to bring about higher reserves and production, at lower finding costs, in the future. Net income in 2002 totaled $25.8 million compared to $17.7 million in 2001. A $3.1 million gain on retirement of securities was realized in 2002 versus $4.0 million in 2001. Production decreased 2% to 150.1 Mmcfe per day due to lower production in the Gulf Coast region. Revenues of $190.9 million were $17.9 million lower than 2001 due to the production decline and a 7% decrease in average prices to $3.49 per mcfe. The average prices received for oil decreased 13% to $22.25 per barrel and for gas decreased 4% to $3.50 per mcf. Production expenses decreased $3.0 million to $31.9 million as a result of reduced workover costs in the Gulf Coast. Operating cost per mcfe produced (excluding production and ad valorem taxes) averaged $0.58 in 2002 versus $0.63 in 2001. Transportation and gathering revenues were approximately the same as 2001 at $3.5 million. IPFs $3.8 million of revenues declined 43% from 2001. IPF records income on payments received on transactions that do not have a valuation 38 Table of Contents allowance. On accounts with a valuation allowance, IPF reduces the carrying value of the receivable. Due to a declining portfolio balance in 2001, less income was recorded from payments received. Due to a significantly lower portfolio balance in 2002, less income was again recorded. During 2001, IPF expenses included $1.8 million of administrative costs, $1.8 million of interest and a net unfavorable adjustment of $122,000 to IPF receivables. During 2002, IPF expenses included $1.7 million of administrative costs, $937,000 of interest costs and $4.2 million was added to the valuation allowance. Exploration expense increased 96% to $11.5 million in 2002 primarily due to higher dry hole cost, additional seismic purchases and personnel expenses. General and administrative increased 41% due to an increase in non cash mark to market deferred compensation expense ($3.4 million), additional personnel costs ($1.4 million) and higher insurance and consulting costs ($550,000) offset by lower bad debt expenses. The average number of general and administrative personnel increased 12% between 2001 and 2002. Other revenue decreased from income of $490,000 in 2001 to a loss of $2.9 million in 2002. The 2002 period included a $2.7 million ineffective loss and $1.2 million write down of marketable securities, offset by a $715,000 recovery on an arbitration. Interest expense decreased 28% to $23.2 million primarily as a result of lower debt balances and falling interest rates. The 2001 period included $2.3 million of ineffective hedging gains and a $689,000 gain on asset sales, partially offset by a $1.7 million write down of marketable securities and a $1.4 million bad debt expense related to Enron commodity hedges. Average debt outstanding on the Senior Credit Facility was $105.3 million and $90.5 million for 2002 and 2001, respectively, and the average interest rates were 3.4% and 6.4%, respectively. Depletion, depreciation and amortization decreased 1% to $76.8 million as a result of lower production. The DDA rate per mcfe in 2002 was $1.40, a $0.01 increase from 2001. The DDA rate is determined based on year end reserves (based on NYMEX futures prices averaging $4.11 per mcf and $23.36 per barrel) and the net book value associated with them and to a lesser extent, depreciation on other assets owned. The DDA rate in the fourth quarter of 2002 was $1.44 per mcfe, reflecting year end 2002 reserves. The Company recorded a $31.1 million provision for impairment on acreage and proved properties at year end 2001 due to performance declines in the reserves and reductions in the value of various properties. No impairment was recorded in 2002. 39 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about the Companys potential exposure to market risks. The term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward looking information provides indicators of how the Company views and manages its ongoing market risk exposures. All of the Companys market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts of the Company are US dollar denominated. Commodity Price Risk The Companys major market risk is exposure to oil and gas prices. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American gas production. Oil and gas prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. The Company periodically enters hedging arrangements with respect to its oil and gas production. Hedging is intended to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations. The majority of hedges are swaps where the Company receives a fixed price for its production and pays market prices to the counterparty. In the second quarter of 2003, the hedging program was modified to include collars which assume a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. Realized gains and losses are generally recognized in oil and gas revenues when the associated production occurs. Starting in 2001, gains or losses on open contracts are recorded either in current period income or other comprehensive income (OCI). The gains and losses realized as a result of hedging are substantially offset in the cash market when the commodity is delivered. Ineffective gains and losses are recognized in earnings in other revenue. The Company does not hold or issue derivative instruments for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2003 the Company had oil and gas hedges in place covering 52.6 billion cubic feet of gas, 1.4 million barrels of oil and 0.7 million barrels of NGLs. These contracts expire monthly through December of 2006. The fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of December 31, 2003 approximated a net pre tax loss of $70.6 million. Gains or losses realized on hedging transactions are determined monthly based upon the difference between contract price received by the Company for the sale of its hedged production and the hedge price, generally closing prices on the NYMEX. These gains and losses are included as increases or decreases to oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold. In 2001, there was a net pre tax realized loss associated with the hedges of $6.2 million followed by a gain of $17.8 million in 2002. A 2003 pre tax loss realized of $60.4 million was recorded relating to the Companys hedges. Losses due to commodity hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings in other revenues. The ineffective portion of hedges recorded was a gain of $2.4 million in 2001 and losses of $2.7 million in 2002 and $1.2 million in 2003. In 2003, a 10% reduction in oil and gas prices, excluding amounts fixed through hedging transactions, would have reduced revenue by $28.6 million. If oil and gas futures prices at December 31, 2003 had declined by 10%, the unrealized hedging loss at that date would have decreased $35.9 million. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2003, the Company had $358.2 million of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $110.0 million bears interest at fixed rates averaging 7.2%. Senior debt and non recourse debt totaling $248.2 million bears interest at floating rates, excluding interest rate swaps, which averaged 3.1% at that date. At December 31, 2003, Great Lakes had interest rate swap agreements totaling $110.0 million, 50% of which is consolidated by Range. These swaps consist of two agreements totaling $45.0 million at 7.1% which expire in May 2004, two agreements totaling $20.0 million at 2.3% which expire in December 2004, one agreement for $10.0 million at 1.4% which expires in June 2005 and two agreements totaling $35.0 million at 1.8% which expire in June 2006. On December 31, 2003, the 30 day LIBOR rate was 1.1%. A 1% increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding (net of amounts fixed through hedging transactions) at December 31, 2003 would cost the Company approximately $1.9 million in additional annual interest, net of swaps. 40 Table of Contents
