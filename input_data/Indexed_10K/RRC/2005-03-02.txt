ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (Capitalized terms herein are defined in the footnotes to our consolidated financial statements contained herein.) The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Statements in our discussion may be forward looking statements. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that a number of factors could cause future production, revenues and expenses to differ materially from our expectations. See Item 1 of this report, Risk Factors, for additional discussion of some of these factors and risks. Overview We are an independent natural gas and oil company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, primarily in the Southwestern, Appalachian and Gulf Coast regions of the United States. We operate in one segment as each of our operations areas has similar economics characteristics and each meets the criteria for aggregation as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information. We seek to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects coupled with complementary acquisitions. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. During 2004, we achieved the following results: 72% reserve growth and 24% production growth Positive financial results Favorable drilling results Complementary acquisitions completed Balance sheet simplified Drilling inventory expanded, coalbed methane and shale plays added 25 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally adopted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and related footnote disclosures. Application of certain of our accounting policies, including those related to oil and gas revenues, bad debts, the fair value of derivatives, oil and gas properties, asset retirement obligations, marketable securities, income taxes and contingencies and litigation require significant estimates. We base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that are believed reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements. Property, Plant and Equipment Proved reserves are defined by the SEC as those volumes of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Although our engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. Reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revision, which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price and cost changes and other economic factors. Changes in oil and gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions in turn cause adjustments in the depletion rates utilized by us. We cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods. Reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our Vice President of Reservoir Engineering who reports directly to our Chief Operating Officer. In addition, because substantially all of our proved reserves are pledged as collateral for our senior credit facility, our estimates of proved reserves are reviewed twice annually by independent engineers on behalf of each of the sixteen banks participating in our senior credit facility. To further ensure the reliability of reserve estimates, we engage independent petroleum consultants to review the estimates of proved reserves. The following table sets forth a summary of the reserves which were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2004, 2003 and 2002. Audited (a) 2004 2003 2002 88% 87% 84% (a) Audited reserves are those quantities which were estimated by our employees and reviewed by an independent petroleum consultant. We utilize the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures. Unsuccessful exploration wells are expensed and can have a significant effect on reported operating results. Successful exploration drilling costs and all development costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved oil and gas reserves as estimated by our engineers. The successful efforts method inherently relies upon the estimation of proved reserves, which includes proved developed and proved undeveloped volumes. We adhere to statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 19 (SFAS 19) for recognizing any impairment of capitalized costs to unproved properties. The greatest portion of these costs generally relate to the acquisition of leasehold costs. The costs are capitalized and periodically evaluated as to recoverability, based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in business strategy employed by management. We consider a combination of time, geologic and engineering factors to evaluate the need for impairment of these costs. Unproved properties had a net book value of $14.8 million, $12.2 million and $19.0 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Depletion rates are determined based on reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of producing properties. As the estimated reserves are adjusted, the depletion expense for a property will change, assuming no change in production volumes or the costs capitalized. Estimated reserves are used as the basis for calculating the expected future cash flows from a property, which are used to determine whether that property may be impaired. Reserves are also used to estimate the supplemental disclosure of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas producing activities and reserve quantities disclosure in Note 18, Unaudited Supplemental Reserve Information to our consolidated financial statements. Changes in the estimated reserves are considered in estimates for accounting purposes and are reflected on a prospective basis. 26 Table of Contents We monitor our long lived assets recorded in property, plant and equipment in our consolidated balance sheet to ensure they are fairly presented. We must evaluate our properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices, an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and gas reserves that will be produced from a field, the timing of future production, future production costs, future abandonment costs, and future inflation. The need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors, including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or gas, unfavorable adjustment to reserves, physical damage to production equipment and facilities, a change in costs, or other changes to contracts, environmental regulations or tax laws. All of these factors must be considered when testing a propertys carrying value for impairment. We cannot predict whether impairment charges may be required in the future. We had an impairment of $3.6 million in 2004 on an offshore property. Derivatives We use commodity derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil and gas price volatility. We account for our commodity derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133). Earnings are affected by the ineffective portion of a hedge contract (changes in realized prices that do not match the changes in the hedge price). Ineffective gains or losses are recorded in other revenue while the hedge contract is open and may increase or reverse until settlement of the contract. This may result in significant volatility to current period income. For derivatives qualifying as hedges, the effective portion of any changes in fair value is recognized in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income, or OCI, and then reclassified to earnings, in oil and gas revenue, when the transaction is consummated. This may result in significant volatility in stockholders equity. The fair value of open hedging contracts is an estimated amount that could be realized upon termination. The commodity derivatives we use include commodity collars and swaps. While there is a risk that the financial benefit or rising prices may not be captured, we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important. Among these benefits are: more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions, the flexibility to enter into long term projects requiring substantial committed capital, smoother and more efficient execution of our ongoing development drilling and production enhancement programs, more consistent returns on invested capital, and better access to bank and other credit markets. We also have some interest rate swap agreements to protect against the volatility of variable interest rates under our senior credit facility. Asset Retirement Obligations We have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as well as regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. Asset retirement obligations are not unique to us or to the oil and gas industry and in 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, (SFAS 143). We adopted this statement effective January 1, 2003, as discussed in Note 4, Asset Retirement Obligations, to our consolidated financial statements. SFAS 143 significantly changed the method of accruing for costs that an entity is legally obligated to incur related to the retirement of fixed assets (asset retirement obligations or ARO). Primarily, the statement requires us to record a separate liability for the fair value of our asset retirement obligations, with an offsetting increase to the related oil and gas properties on our consolidated balance sheet. Inherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate retirement costs, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of retirement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. In addition, increases in the discounted ARO liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense in our consolidated statement of operations. SFAS 143 required a cumulative adjustment to reflect the impact of implementing the statement had the rule been in effect since inception. We calculated the cumulative accretion expense on the ARO liability and the cumulative depletion expense on the corresponding property balance. The sum of this cumulative expense was compared to the depletion expense originally recorded. Because the historically recorded depletion expense was higher than the cumulative expense calculated under SFAS 143, the difference resulted in a $4.5 million gain, net of tax, which we recorded as cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on January 1, 2003. 27 Table of Contents Deferred Taxes We are subject to income and other taxes in all areas in which we operate. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required because: (a) income tax returns are generally filed many months after the close of a calendar year; (b) tax returns are subject to audit which can take years to complete; and (c) future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized. We have deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryovers and other deductible differences. We routinely evaluate all deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization. A valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when we believe that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized. In determining deferred tax liabilities, accounting rules require OCI to be considered, even though such income (loss) has not yet been earned. At year end 2003, deferred tax assets exceeded deferred tax liabilities by $9.0 million with $24.6 million of deferred tax assets related to unrealized deferred hedging losses included in OCI. At year end 2004, deferred tax liabilities exceeded deferred tax assets by $91.4 million with $26.0 million of deferred tax assets related to unrealized deferred hedging losses included in OCI. Based on our projected profitability and because if prices remain constant, the unrealized hedging losses should be offset in the future by higher realization on our production, no year end 2004 valuation allowance was deemed necessary. We may be challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions on our various income tax returns. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for all taxes, gains or losses could occur in the future due to changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding tax matters. Contingent Liabilities A provision for legal, environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost or range of cost can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal, environmental and contingent matters. In addition, we often must estimate the amount of such losses. In many cases, our judgment is based on the input of our legal advisors and on the interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or the courts. We monitor known and potential legal, environmental and other contingent matters and make our best estimate of when to record losses for these matters based on available information. Although we continue to monitor all contingencies closely, particularly our outstanding litigation, we currently have no material accruals for contingent liabilities. Bad Debt Expense We periodically assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectability. At Independent Producer Finance, or IPF, receivables are evaluated quarterly and provisions for uncollectible amounts are established. Such provisions for uncollectible amounts are recorded when management believes that a related receivable is not recoverable based on current estimates of expected discounted cash flows and other factors which could affect the collection. Revenues We recognize revenues from the sale of products and services in the period delivered. We use the sales method to account for gas imbalances, recognizing revenue based on cash received rather than gas produced. Revenues are sensitive to changes in prices received for our products. A substantial portion of production is sold at prevailing market prices, which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control. Changes in the supply and demand for oil and natural gas can have dramatic effects on prices. Political instability and availability of alternative fuels could impact worldwide supply, while economic factors can impact demand. At IPF, payments believed to relate to return are recognized as income. Currently, all IPF receipts are being recognized as a return of capital. Other We record a write down of marketable securities when the decline in market value is considered to be other than temporary. Third party reimbursements for administrative overhead costs incurred due to our role as operator of oil and gas properties are applied to reduce general and administrative expense. Salaries and other employment costs of those employees working on our exploration efforts are expensed as exploration expense. We do not capitalize general and administrative expense or interest expense. Recent Accounting Pronouncements On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Statement No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. Statement 123(R) supercedes APB opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to employees, and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in Statement 123(R) is similar to the approach described in Statement 123. However, Statement 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. The provisions of this statement become effective for our third quarter 2005. Management has not determined the impact that this statement will have on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a FASB Staff Position (FSP) that provides accounting guidance on how companies should account for the effects of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 that was signed into law on October 22, 2004. FSP FAS 109 1, Application of FASB Statement No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities Provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, states that the manufacturers deduction provided for under this legislation should be accounted for as a special deduction instead of a tax rate change. The FSP may affect how a company accounts for deferred income taxes. The FSP is effective December 31, 2004. We are currently evaluating the impact from the FSP on our results of operations and financial position and we expect to complete our evaluation during the first half of fiscal 2005. 28 Table of Contents FACTORS AFFECTING FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Liquidity and Capital Resources During 2004, we spent $832.9 million on acquisitions, development and exploration. Acquisition expenditures were primarily comprised of $310.7 million for the 50% of Great Lakes we did not own and $297.8 million for the Pine Mountain acquisition. See footnote 16 to our consolidated financial statements. At December 31, 2004, we had $18.4 million in cash, including $17.3 million of cash proceeds held in escrow to be used to purchase similar assets and $1.6 billion of total assets. Total capitalization was $1.2 billion, of which 48% was represented by stockholder equity and 52% by debt. At December 31, 2004, we had a working capital deficit of $40.8 million which included an unrealized hedging liability of $61.0 million due to the mark to market of all open hedges. Because payments on this hedging liability are made monthly and we will also collect production proceeds to which this hedging relates, the amount should be self funding. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves which is typical in the capital intensive extractive industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We believe that net cash generated from operating activities and unused committed borrowing capacity under the senior credit facility combined with our oil and gas price hedges currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near term financial obligations and liquidity needs. However, long term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and gas business. A material drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, reduce debt, meet financial obligations and remain profitable. We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of oil and gas, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proved reserves. In 2004, we filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the SEC registering $500.0 million aggregate amount of common stock, preferred stock and other equity and debt securities. In December 2004, we issued 5.75 million shares of common stock under this shelf registration statement for an aggregate price of $107.8 million. As of December 31, 2004, we have $392.2 million of capacity remaining under the shelf. The following summarizes our contractual financial obligations at December 31, 2004 and their future maturities. We expect to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities and refinancing proceeds. Payment due by period 2006 and 2008 and 2005 2007 2009 Thereafter Total (in thousands) Long term debt $ $ $ 423,900 (a) $ 200,000 $ 623,900 Interest on 7.375% notes 14,750 29,500 29,500 59,000 132,750 Capital leases 11 5 16 Operating leases 2,745 2,394 388 5,527 Seismic purchase 215 215 Derivative obligations(b) 60,471 10,720 71,191 Asset retirement obligation liability 6,822 14,502 13,295 36,108 70,727 Total contractual obligations(c) $ 85,014 $ 57,121 $ 467,083 $ 295,108 $ 904,326 (a)Due at termination date of our senior credit facility, which we expect to renew, but there is no assurance that can be accomplished. Interest paid on the senior credit facility would be approximately $16.5 million each year assuming no change in the interest rate or outstanding balance. (b)Derivative obligations represent net open hedging contracts valued as of December 31, 2004. (c)This table does not include the liability for the deferred compensation plan since these obligations will be funded with existing plan assets. 29 Table of Contents Bank Credit Facility We maintain a $600.0 million revolving credit facility, which we refer to as our Senior Credit Facility. The Senior Credit Facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and matures on January 1, 2008. Availability under the Senior Credit Facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the banks semi annually and more often in certain other circumstances. The borrowing base is dependent on a number of factors, primarily the lenders assessment of future cash flows. Redeterminations of the borrowing base require approval of 75% of the lenders; increases require unanimous approval. At February 26, 2005, the Senior Credit Facility had a $575.0 million borrowing base of which $134.5 million was available. Restrictions on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments as defined are imposed under the our Senior Credit Facility and the 7.375% Notes. Under the Senior Credit Facility, common and preferred dividends are permitted. The terms of the 7.375% Notes limit restricted payments (including dividends) to the greater of $20.0 million or a formula based on earnings since the issuance of the notes. At December 31, 2004, approximately $266.9 million was available under the 7.375% Notes restricted basket. The Senior Credit Facility provides for a restricted payment basket of $20.0 million plus 66 2/3% of net cash proceeds from common stock issuances and 50% of net income. Approximately $250.3 million was available under the Senior Credit Facility basket as of December 31, 2004. The debt agreements contain customary qualitative covenants relating to debt incurrence, working capital, dividends and a debt to earnings ratio. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2004. Cash Dividend Payments In December 2003, we announced the reinstatement of cash dividends on our common stock at an initial quarterly dividend rate of one cent per share. The first dividend was paid on January 30, 2004. A one cent per share dividend was declared in the second and third quarters of 2004. On December 1, 2004, a two cent per share dividend was declared and paid on December 31, 2004. The payment of dividends is subject to declaration by our board of directors and depends on earnings, capital expenditures and various other factors, such as restrictions under our Senior Credit Facility and the 7.375% Notes discussed above. Preferred dividends of $738,000, $737,000, $737,000 and $738,000 were paid in the first, second, third and fourth quarters of 2004. In addition, $2.2 million of preferred dividend was accrued at December 31, 2004 related to the conversion of the 5.9% Convertible Preferred Stock. Cash Flow Our principal sources of cash are operating cash flow, bank borrowings and at times, issuance of debt and equity securities. Our operating cash flow is highly dependent on oil and gas prices. As of December 31, 2004, we had entered into hedging agreements covering 56.6 Bcfe and 22.5 Bcfe for 2005 and 2006, respectively. The $174.8 million of cash capital expenditures for 2004, excluding acquisitions, was funded with internal cash flow. The $254.0 million 2005 capital budget, which excludes acquisitions, is expected to increase production and to expand the reserve base. Based on current projections, oil and gas futures prices and our hedge position, the 2005 capital program is expected to be funded with internal cash flow. Net cash provided by operations in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $213.3 million, $125.5 million and $114.5 million respectively. In 2004, cash flow from operations increased due to higher volumes and prices partially offset by increasing operating and exploration expenses. In 2003, cash flow from operations increased with higher volumes and higher prices partially offset by increasing operating and exploration expenses. In 2002, cash flow from operations decreased due to lower prices and volumes, higher exploration and higher general and administrative expenses. This decrease was partially offset by lower interest expenses and direct operating expenses. Net cash used in investing activities in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $628.3 million, $187.6 million and $104.0 million, respectively. The 2004 period included $170.6 million in additions to oil and gas properties and $485.6 million of acquisitions. The 2003 period included $92.0 million in additions to oil and gas properties, and $103.9 million of acquisitions, partially offset by $12.1 million of IPF receipts. The 2002 period included $92.6 million in additions to oil and gas properties and $5.1 million of IPF investments partially offset by $17.3 million of IPF receipts. Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities in 2004, 2003 and 2002 was $432.8 million, $61.5 million and ($12.6 million), respectively. Historically, sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and 30 Table of Contents debt offerings. During 2004, we received proceeds of $98.1 million and $250.5 million from the issuance of additional 7 3/8% Notes and two common stock offerings, respectively. During 2004, the outstanding balance under our Senior Credit Facility increased $245.7 million with $70.0 million related to the Great Lakes transaction and the remaining increase the result of funding other acquisitions. Also in 2004, we redeemed the remaining outstanding 6% Debentures for $11.6 million. During 2003, the outstanding balance under our Senior Credit Facility increased $62.4 million primarily due to the December acquisition of producing properties in the Conger field. In 2003, total debt declined $9.9 million. During 2003, we redeemed $84.8 million of the Trust Preferred Securities and $69.3 million of the 8.75% Notes and issued $100.0 million of 7.375% Notes. During 2002, the outstanding balance under our Senior Credit Facility increased $20.8 million and total debt (including Trust Preferred Securities) decreased by $24.2 million. Capital Requirements Our primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends. During 2004, $174.8 million of capital was expended, primarily on drilling projects. Also during 2004, $485.6 million was expended on acquisitions, including $470.1 million to purchase producing properties and $15.5 million to purchase gathering facilities. The capital program, excluding acquisitions, was funded by net cash flow from operations. The 2005 capital budget of $254.0 million, excluding acquisitions, is expected to be funded by cash flow from operations. Development and exploration activities are highly discretionary, and, for the foreseeable future, we expect such activities to be maintained at levels equal to or below internal cash flow. To the extent capital requirements exceed internal cash flow, debt or equity may be issued to fund these requirements. We currently believe we have sufficient liquidity and cash flow to meet our obligations for the next twelve months; however, a drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production or reserves could adversely affect our ability to fund capital expenditures and meet our financial obligations. Also, our obligations may change due to acquisitions, divestitures and continued growth. We may issue additional shares of stock, subordinated notes or other debt securities to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, extend maturities or to repay debt. Hedging Oil and Gas Prices We enter into hedging agreements to reduce the impact of oil and gas price volatility on our operations. At December 31, 2004, hedges were in place covering 19.7 Bcf of gas at prices averaging $4.25 per mcf, 0.6 million barrels of oil at prices averaging $28.95 per barrel and 0.2 million barrels of NGLs at prices averaging $19.20 per barrel. We also had collars covering 37.8 Bcf of gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of $5.03 to $7.18 and 2.8 million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of $29.84 to $38.66. The hedges fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination, based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX, approximated a pretax loss of $71.9 million at December 31, 2004. The contracts expire monthly through December 2006. Transaction gains and losses are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases on oil and gas revenue in the period the hedged production is sold. A hedging gain of $17.8 million was realized in 2002. Hedging losses of $60.4 million and $100.1 million were realized in 2003 and 2004, respectively. Changes in the value of the ineffective portion of all open hedges are recognized in earnings quarterly in other income. Since 2001, unrealized gains or losses on hedging positions are recorded at an estimate of fair value based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX, on our consolidated balance sheet as OCI, a component of stockholders equity. At December 31, 2004, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding: Contract Type Period Volume Hedged Average Hedge Price Natural gas Swaps 2005 50,695 Mmbtu/day $ 4.21 Swaps 2006 3,288 Mmbtu/day $ 4.85 Collars 2005 67,175 Mmbtu/day $5.25 $ 7.18 Collars 2006 36,363 Mmbtu/day $5.03 $ 6.97 Crude Oil Swaps 2005 1,146 bbl/day $ 26.84 Swaps 2006 400 bbl/day $35.00 Collars 2005 4,415 bbl/day $29.84 $37.05 Collars 2006 3,264 bbl/day $31.53 $38.66 Natural gas liquids Swaps 2005 658 bbl/day $ 19.20 31 Table of Contents Interest Rates At December 31, 2004, we had $620.6 million of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $196.7 million bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.375%. Senior debt totaling $423.9 million bears interest at floating rates, which average 3.9% at year end 2004, excluding interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2004, we had $45.0 million subject to fixed for floating interest rate swap agreements. These swaps consist of one agreement for $10.0 million at 1.4% which expires in June 2005 and two agreements totaling $35.0 million at 1.8% which expire in June 2006. The 30 day LIBOR rate on December 31, 2004 was 2.4%. A 1% increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2004 would cost us approximately $3.8 million in additional annual interest, net of swaps. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material to our financial position or results of operations. Inflation and Changes in Prices Our revenues, the value of our assets, our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices. Oil and gas prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on us. However, industry specific inflationary pressures built up over an 18 month period in 2001 and early 2002 due to favorable conditions in the industry. During 2002, we experienced a slight decline in certain drilling and operational costs when compared to the prior year and in 2003 there were slight increases in these costs. In 2004, we experienced an overall increase in drilling costs compared to 2003 especially with regard to steel products. We expect further increases in these costs for 2005. Increases in commodity prices can cause inflationary pressures specific to the industry to also increase. 32 Table of Contents The following table indicates the average oil and gas prices received over the last five years and quarterly for 2004, 2003 and 2002. Average price calculations exclude hedging gains and losses. Oil is converted to natural gas equivalents at the rate of one barrel per six mcf.

As a mature region, while new discoveries of oil and gas occur in the United States, the size and frequency of these discoveries is declining. We believe that there remain areas of the United States, such as the Appalachian basin and certain areas in our Southwestern division, that are underexplored and have not been fully explored with the benefit of newly available exploration, production and reserve enhancement technology. Examples of such technology include advanced 3D seismic processing, hydraulic reservoir fracture stimulation, advances in well logging and analysis, horizontal drilling and completion techniques, secondary and tertiary recovery practices, and automated remote well monitoring and control devices. Another characteristic of a mature region is the exit of larger independent producers and the major oil companies from such regions. These companies, searching for ever larger new discoveries, have ventured increasingly overseas and offshore, de emphasizing their onshore United States assets. This movement out of mature basins by larger companies has provided attractive acquisition opportunities for companies like ours that maintain well equipped technical teams capable of generating additional value from these assets. In other situations, to increase cash flow without increasing capital spending, larger independent producers and major integrated oil companies have allowed smaller companies the opportunity to explore and develop reserves on their undeveloped acreage through joint ventures. We acquired approximately 70,000 acres in 2004 for our Southwestern division from such arrangements. 33 Table of Contents Results of Operations Volumes and Sales Data 2004 2003 2002 Production: Crude oil (bbls) 2,512,434 2,023,158 1,872,654 NGLs (bbls) 988,192 400,631 406,746 Natural gas (mcfs) 50,722,121 43,510,180 41,095,976 Total (mcfe)(a) 71,725,877 58,052,911 54,772,376 Average daily production: Crude oil (bbls) 6,865 5,543 5,131 NGLs (bbls) 2,700 1,098 1,114 Natural gas (mcfs) 138,585 119,206 112,592 Total (mcfe)(a) 195,972 159,049 150,061 Average sales prices (excluding hedging): Crude oil (per bbl) $ 39.25 $ 28.42 $ 23.34 NGLs (per bbl) 23.73 18.75 12.93 Natural gas (per mcf) 5.79 5.10 3.02 Total (mcfe)(a) 5.80 4.94 3.16 Average sales prices (including hedging): Crude oil (per bbl) $ 28.04 $ 23.53 $ 22.25 NGLs (per bbl) 19.76 18.75 12.93 Natural gas (per mcf) 4.45 3.94 3.50 Total (per mcfe)(a) 4.40 3.90 3.49 (a) Oil and NGLs are converted to natural gas equivalents at the rate of one barrel per six mcf. 34 Table of Contents The following table identifies certain items included in the results of operations and is presented to assist in comparing results of the last three years.

Overview Our 2004 performance reflects the benefit of higher oil and gas production, higher oil and gas prices, and continued focus upon our cost structure. The business of exploring for, developing, and acquiring oil and gas is highly competitive and capital intensive. As in any commodity business, the costs associated with finding, acquiring, extracting, and financing the operation are critical to profitability and long term value creation for stockholders and generating meaningful growth while containing costs represents an ongoing challenge for management. During periods of historically high oil and gas prices, such as 2004, cost increases are more prevalent due to increased competition for goods and services. We faced other challenges in 2004 include attracting and retaining qualified personnel, consummating and integrating acquisitions, and accessing the capital markets to fund our growth and capital simplification process on sufficiently favorable terms. We have continued to expand and improve the technical staff through the hiring of additional experienced professionals. Also, acquisitions completed in late 2003 and 2004 have added experienced professionals to our teams. The inventory of exploration and development prospects continues to expand, providing promising new growth opportunities, greater diversification of technical risk, and better efficiency. Our balance sheet was further simplified in 2004 with the retirement of the 6% convertible subordinated notes and the elimination of the Great Lakes bank credit facility. Lastly, the 5.9% convertible preferred stock was converted to common stock in December of 2004. Our capital structure now consists of bank debt, senior subordinated notes and common equity. 35 Table of Contents Comparison of 2004 to 2003 Net income increased $6.8 million, with higher average oil and gas prices and volumes as a primary factor contributing to this increase. Increased revenues were partially offset by higher operating costs and higher DDA. The year ended 2003 included an $18.5 million gain on retirement of debt and convertible securities versus a loss of $39,000 in 2004. The year ended 2003 also included a $4.5 million favorable cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. Average realized price received for oil and gas during 2004 was $4.40 per mcfe, up 13% or $0.50 per mcfe from 2003. Oil and gas revenues for 2004 reached a record $315.7 million and were 39% higher than 2003 due to higher oil and gas prices and a 24% increase in production. The average price received increased 19% to $28.04 per barrel for oil and increased 13% to $4.45 per mcf for gas from 2003. The effect of our hedging program decreased realized prices $1.40 per mcfe in 2004 versus a decrease of $1.04 in 2003. Production volume increased 24% from 2003 due to our drilling program and additions from acquisitions consummated in late 2003 and 2004, primarily the Conger Field acquisition in 2003 and our purchase of the 50% of Great Lakes that we did not own in 2004. Production increased 13.7 Mmcfe from 2003. Our production volumes increased 56% in our Appalachian Division, increased 30% in our Southwestern division and declined 14% in our Gulf Coast division. Transportation and gathering revenue of $2.2 million declined $1.3 million from 2003. This decline is due to lower oil marketing revenues and additional gas transportation system employee expense related to the Conger Field acquisition ($1.1 million) partially offset by additional revenue related to the Great Lakes acquisition. Gain (loss) on retirement of securities was a loss of $39,000 in 2004 versus a gain of $19.0 million in 2003. The year ended 2004 includes the purchase for cash of $2.7 million of 6% Debentures. During 2003, 129,000 shares of common stock were exchanged for $880,000 of 6% Debentures with a conversion expense of $465,000 recorded on the exchange. In addition, 2003 included $9.1 million of 6% Debentures, $500,000 of 8.75% Notes and $5.3 million of Trust Preferred Securities were repurchased for cash. Also in 2003, $10.2 million of cash and $50.0 million of our newly issued Convertible Preferred was exchanged for $79.5 million of Trust Preferred Securities. Other revenue increased in 2004 to $2.8 million from a loss of $2.7 million in 2003. The 2004 period includes a gain on the sale of properties of $5.0 million and $712,000 of ineffective hedging gains offset by $2.0 million write down of an insurance claim receivable. Other revenue for 2004 also includes net IPF expenses of $1.8 million. Other revenue in 2003 includes an ineffective hedging loss of $1.2 million and net IPF expenses of $1.4 million. Direct operating expense increased $9.9 million to $46.3 million due to increased costs from acquisitions and higher oilfield service costs. Our operating expenses are increasing as we add new wells and maintain production from our existing properties. We incurred $1.8 million of expenses associated with workovers in 2004 versus $2.7 million in 2003. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expenses increased $0.02 per mcfe with higher field level costs offset by lower workover costs. Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices and not hedged prices. These taxes increased $7.6 million or 59% from the same period of the prior year. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes increased from $0.22 per mcfe to $0.29 per mcfe due to higher market prices. Exploration expense increased 52% to $21.2 million due to higher dry hole costs ($8.5 million) and higher personnel costs partially offset by lower seismic purchases ($2.6 million). Exploration expense includes exploration personnel costs of $4.4 million in 2004 versus $3.3 million in 2003. General and administrative expense for 2004 increased 63% or $15.4 million from 2003 due primarily to an $12.6 million increase in the non cash mark to market expense relating to the deferred compensation plan. This non cash expense relates to the increase in value of our common stock and other investments held in our deferred compensation plan. Our common stock price increased from $9.45 per share at the end of 2003 to $20.46 per share at the end of 2004. We also incurred higher professional fees and additional personnel costs due to the Great Lakes acquisition. On a per mcfe basis, excluding the mark to market on the deferred compensation plan, general and administration expense declined from $0.31 per mcfe in 2003 to $0.29 per mcfe in 2004. Interest expense for 2004 increased $1.0 million or 4%, to $23.1 million with higher interest rates and average debt balance partially offset by a lower call premiums of $1.8 million. Interest expense for 2003 included a $2.0 million call premium on the 8.75% Notes. Average debt outstanding on the Senior Credit Facility was $262.4 million and $104.7 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively and the average interest rates were 3.3% and 3.1%, respectively. Depletion, depreciation and amortization (or DDA) increased $16.4 million or 19% to $103.0 million due to higher production and a $3.6 million (or $0.05 per mcfe) impairment charge on an offshore property in our Gulf Coast division. The impairment was attributable to hurricane damage and related production declines. On a per mcfe basis, excluding the impairment charge on the 36 Table of Contents offshore property, DDA declined from $1.49 per mcfe to $1.39 per mcfe. For 2005, based on our current reserve base, we expect our DDA rate to average $1.45 per mcfe. Tax expense for 2004 increased $6.1 million, or 33%, over 2003 due to a 35% increase in income before taxes. Year end 2004 and 2003 provide for a tax rate of 37%. Given our available net operating loss carryforward, we do not expect to pay significant cash federal income taxes. The following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2004. Operating expenses per mcfe 2004 2003 Change Direct operating expense $ 0.65 $ 0.63 $ 0.02 Production and ad valorem tax expense 0.29 0.22 0.07 General and administration expense (excluding non cash mark to market on deferred compensation plan) 0.29 0.31 (0.02 ) Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense (excluding impairment) 1.39 1.49 (0.10 ) Comparison of 2003 to 2002 Net income increased $9.6 million as a result of higher oil and gas prices and volumes, partially offset by higher operating, exploration and general and administrative costs and higher DDA. The year ended 2003 included an $18.5 million gain on retirement of debt and convertible securities versus a $3.1 million gain in 2002 and a $4.5 million favorable cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. Average realized price received for oil and gas during 2003 was $3.90 per mcfe, up 12% or $0.41 per mcfe from 2002. Oil and gas revenues for 2003 reached $226.4 million and were 19% higher than 2002 due to higher oil and gas prices and a 6% increase in production. The average price received increased 6% to $23.53 per barrel for oil and increased 13% to $3.94 per mcf for gas from 2002. The effect of our hedging program decreased realized prices $1.04 per mcfe in 2003 versus an increase of $0.33 in 2002. Production volume increased 6% during 2003 primarily through drilling activities on existing and newly acquired acreage acquisitions. Production increased 3.3 Mmcfe from 2002. Our production volumes increased 9% in our Southwestern division, increased 5% in our Appalachian division and declined 8% in our Gulf Coast division. Gain (loss) on retirement of securities was a gain of $18.5 million in 2003 versus $3.1 million in 2002. During 2003, 129,000 shares of common stock were exchanged for $880,000 of 6% Debentures. A conversion expense of $465,000 was recorded on the exchange. In addition, $9.1 million of 6% Debentures, $500,000 of 8.75% Notes and $5.3 million of Trust Preferred Securities were repurchased for cash. Also in 2003, $10.2 million of cash and $50.0 million of our newly issued Convertible Preferred was exchanged for $79.5 million of Trust Preferred Securities. In 2002, 1.6 million shares of common stock were exchanged for $2.4 million of Trust Preferred Securities, $7.1 million of 6% Debenture and $875,000 of 8.75% Notes. In addition, $2.5 million of Trust Preferred Securities, $815,000 of .6% Debentures and $9.0 million of 8.75% Notes were repurchased. Other revenue increased from a loss in 2002 of $6.0 million to a loss of $2.7 million in 2003. The 2003 period includes $1.2 million of ineffective hedging losses and a net $1.4 million of IPF expenses. The 2002 period includes $2.7 million of ineffective hedging losses, $3.1 million net IPF expenses and a $1.2 million write down of marketable securities, offset by a $715,000 arbitration recovery. Direct operating expense increased $4.6 million to $36.4 million due to higher workover costs and increased costs from acquisitions and new wells. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expenses increased $0.05 per mcfe, from $0.58 in 2002 to $0.63 in 2003. Production and ad valorem taxes increased $4.3 million, or 50% as a direct result of increased market prices combined with higher production volumes. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes increased from $0.16 per mcfe to $0.22 per mcfe due to higher market prices. Exploration expense increased 21% to $13.9 million due to higher seismic purchases ($3.9 million) partially offset by lower dry hole costs ($1.7 million). Exploration expenses include exploration personnel costs of $3.3 million in 2003 versus $2.8 million in 2002. General and administrative expense for 2003 increased 41% or $7.1 million from 2002 due primarily to a $5.5 million increase in the non cash mark to market expense relating to the deferred compensation plan and $1.6 million of higher salary and related benefit costs as well as higher director fees, legal and consulting fees and insurance costs. On a per mcfe basis, excluding the mark to market on the deferred compensation plan, general and administrative expense increased from $0.30 per mcfe in 2002 to $0.31 per mcfe in 2003. 37 Table of Contents Interest expense for 2003 declined $1.0 million or 4%, to $22.2 million. The decrease was attributable to lower outstanding debt and interest rates during 2003, partially offset by a call premium of $2.0 million on the 8.75% Notes included in interest expense. Average debt outstanding on the Senior Credit Facility was $104.7 million and $105.3 million for 2003 and 2002, respectively and the average interest rates were 3.1% and 3.4%, respectively. Depletion, depreciation, and amortization increased 13% to $86.5 million due to higher production, an additional $4.5 million of accretion expense related to the adoption of the new accounting principle for abandonment costs, and higher unproved property charges. On a per mcfe basis, DDA increased from $1.40 per mcfe to $1.49 per mcfe, primarily due to the added accretion expense ($.08) and unproved property charges ($.03). Tax expense for 2003 was an $18.5 million tax provision versus a $3.4 million tax benefit for 2002. The 2002 year included the reversal of a valuation allowance as an $11.2 million reduction to 2002 income tax expense. Year end 2003 provides tax expense at a rate of 37%. We adopted the provisions of SFAS 143 on January 1, 2003 and recognized a $4.5 million benefit from the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle, net of $2.4 million in taxes. The following table presents information about our operating expense for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2003. Operating expenses per mcfe 2003 2002 Change Direct operating expense $ 0.63 $ 0.58 $ 0.05 Production and ad valorem tax expense 0.22 0.16 0.06 General and administrative expense (excluding non cash mark to market on deferred compensation plan) 0.31 0.30 0.01 Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense 1.49 1.40 0.09 38 Table of Contents GLOSSARY The terms defined in this glossary are used in this report. bbl.

QUANTITIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposure. All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are US dollar denominated. Commodity Price Risk Our major market risk is exposure to oil and gas prices. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American gas production. Oil and gas prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. We periodically enter into hedging arrangements with respect to our oil and gas production. Hedging is intended to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations. Certain of our hedges are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. In the second quarter of 2003, the hedging program was modified to include collars which assume a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. Realized gains and losses are generally recognized in oil and gas revenues when the associated production occurs. Starting in 2002, gains or losses on open contracts are recorded either in current period income or other comprehensive income (OCI). Generally, derivative losses occur when market prices increase, which are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transaction. Conversely, derivative gains occur when market prices decrease, which are offset by losses on the underlying commodity transaction. Ineffective gains and losses are recognized in earnings in other revenue. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2004, we had oil and gas swaps in place covering 19.7 billion cubic feet of gas, 0.6 million barrels of oil and 0.2 million barrels of NGLs. We also had collars covering 37.8 Bcf of gas and 2.8 million barrels of oil. These contracts expire monthly through December 2006. The fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of December 31, 2004, approximated a net pre tax loss of $71.9 million. Gains or losses realized on hedging transactions are determined monthly based upon the difference between contract price received by us for the sale of our hedged production and the hedge price, generally closing prices on the NYMEX. These gains and losses are included as increases or decreases to oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold. In 2002, there was a net pre tax realized gain associated with the hedges of $17.8 million followed by a loss of $60.4 million in 2003. In 2004 pre tax loss realized of $100.1 million was recorded relating to our hedges. Losses due to commodity hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings in other revenues in our consolidated statement of operations. The ineffective portion of hedges recorded was a loss of $2.7 million in 2002 and $1.2 million in 2003 and a gain of $712,000 in 2004. At December 31, 2004, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding: Contract Type Period Volume Hedged Average Hedge Price Natural gas Swaps 2005 50,695 Mmbtu/day $4.21 Swaps 2006 3,288 Mmbtu/day $4.85 Collars 2005 67,175 Mmbtu/day $5.25 $7.18 Collars 2006 36,363 Mmbtu/day $5.03 $6.97 Crude Oil Swaps 2005 1,146 bbl/day $26.84 Swaps 2006 400 bbl/day $35.00 Collars 2005 4,415 bbl/day $29.84 $37.05 Collars 2006 3,264 bbl/day $31.53 $38.66 Natural gas liquids Swaps 2005 658 bbl/day $19.20 41 Table of Contents In 2004, a 10% reduction in oil and gas prices, excluding amounts fixed through hedging transactions, would have reduced revenue by $41.5 million. If oil and gas futures prices at December 31, 2004 had declined by 10%, the unrealized hedging loss at that date would have decreased $33.5 million. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2004, we had $620.6 million of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $196.7 million bears interest at a fixed rate of 7.375%. Senior debt totaling $423.9 million bears interest at floating rates, excluding interest rate swaps, which averaged 3.9% on that date. At December 31, 2004, we had floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements totaling $45.0 million. These swaps consist of one agreement for $10.0 million at 1.4% which expires in June 2005 and two agreements totaling $35.0 million at 1.8% which expire in June 2006. On December 31, 2004, the 30 day LIBOR rate was 2.4%. A 1% increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding (net of amounts fixed through hedging transactions) at December 31, 2004 would cost us approximately $3.8 million in additional annual interest rates, net of swaps.
