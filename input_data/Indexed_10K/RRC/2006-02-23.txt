ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with Item 6, Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Statements in our discussion may be forward looking. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that a number of factors could cause future production, revenues and expenses to differ materially from our expectations. See Disclosures Regarding Forward Looking Statements at the beginning of this Annual Report and Risk Factors in Item 1A for additional discussion of some of these factors and risks. Overview of Our Business We are an independent natural gas and oil company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, primarily in the Southwestern, Appalachian and Gulf Coast regions of the United States. We operate in one segment as each of our operating areas has similar economic characteristics and each meets the criteria for aggregation as defined in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 131, Disclosure About Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information. Our strategy is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects coupled with complementary acquisitions. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Industry Environment We operate entirely within the United States, a mature region for the exploration and production of oil and gas. As a mature region, while new discoveries of oil and gas occur in the United States, the size and frequency of these discoveries is declining, while finding and development costs are increasing. We believe that there remain areas of the United States, such as the Appalachian basin and certain areas in our Southwest and Gulf Coast Divisions, which are underexplored or have not been fully explored and developed with the benefit of newly available exploration, production and reserve enhancement technology. Examples of such technology include advanced 3 D seismic processing, hydraulic reservoir fracture stimulation, advances in well logging and analysis, horizontal drilling and completion techniques, secondary and tertiary recovery practices, and automated remote well monitoring and control devices. Another characteristic of a mature region is the exit of larger independent producers and the major oil companies from such regions. These companies, searching for ever larger new discoveries, have ventured increasingly overseas and offshore, de emphasizing their onshore United States assets. This movement out of mature basins by larger companies has provided acquisition opportunities for companies like ours that maintain well equipped technical teams capable of generating additional value from these assets. In other situations, to increase cash flow without increasing capital spending, larger independent producers and major integrated oil companies have allowed smaller companies the opportunity to explore and develop reserves on their undeveloped acreage through joint ventures and farm in arrangements. We believe the acquisition market for natural gas properties has become extremely competitive as producers vie for additional production and expanded drilling opportunities. Acquisition values have reached historic highs and we expect these values to continue to climb in 2006. In addition, we expect drilling and service costs to increase in 2006 and for lease operating expenses to continue to rise as producers are forced to make operational enhancements to maintain aging fields. Source of Our Revenues We derive our revenues from the sale of natural gas and oil that is produced from our natural gas and oil properties. Revenues are a function of the volume produced and the prevailing market price at the time of sale. The price of oil and natural gas is the primary factor affecting our revenues. To achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to downward price fluctuations, we utilize derivative instruments to hedge future sales prices on a significant portion of our natural gas and oil production. During 2005, 2004 and 2003, the use of derivative instruments prevented us from realizing the full benefit of upward price movements and may continue to do so in future periods. 22 Table of Contents Principal Components of Our Cost Structure Direct Operating Expenses. The day to day costs incurred to bring hydrocarbons out of the ground and to the market together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties. Such costs also include workovers and repairs to our oil and gas properties not covered by insurance. These costs are expected to increase in 2006 as the demand for these services continues to increase. Production and Ad Valorem Taxes. These costs are primarily paid based on a percentage of market prices and not on hedged prices of production or at fixed rates established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. Exploration Expense. Geological and geophysical costs, seismic costs, delay rentals and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells or dry holes. General and Administrative Expense. Overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, managing our production and development operations, audit and other professional fees and legal compliance are included in general and administrative expense. Interest. We typically finance our working capital requirements and acquisitions with borrowings under our bank credit facility, and with our longer term publically traded debt securities. As a result, we incur substantial interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. We may continue to incur significant interest expense as we continue to grow. We expect our 2006 capital budget to be funded with internal cash flow. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. The systematic expensing of the capital costs incurred to acquire, explore and develop natural gas and oil. As a successful efforts company, we capitalize all costs associated with our acquisition and development efforts, and all successful exploration efforts, and apportion these costs to each unit of production through depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. This also includes the systematic, monthly accretion of the future abandonment costs of tangible assets such as platforms, wells, service assets, pipelines, and other facilities. Income Taxes. We are subject to state and federal income taxes but are currently not in a tax paying position for regular federal income taxes, primarily due to the current deductibility of intangible drilling costs, or IDC. We do pay some state income taxes where our IDC deductions do not exceed our taxable income or where state income taxes are determined on another basis. Currently, all of our federal taxes are deferred; however, at some point, we will utilize all of our net operating loss carryforwards and we will recognize current income tax and continue to recognize current tax expense as long as we are generating taxable income. Overview of 2005 Results During 2005, we achieved the following results: 22% production growth and 20% reserve growth; Drilled over 590 net wells; Continued expansion of drilling inventory and emerging plays; Record financial results and continued balance sheet improvement; and Completed an acquisition of properties containing 77 Bcfe of proved reserves. 23 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Income and Operations Volumes and Price Data 2005 2004 2003 Production: Crude oil (bbls) 3,031,468 2,512,434 2,023,158 NGLs (bbls) 1,011,692 988,192 400,631 Natural gas (mcfs) 63,003,600 50,722,121 43,510,180 Total (mcfe) (a) 87,262,560 71,725,877 58,052,911 Average daily production: Crude oil (bbls) 8,305 6,865 5,543 NGLs (bbls) 2,772 2,700 1,098 Natural gas (mcfs) 172,613 138,585 119,206 Total (mcfe) (a) 239,076 195,972 159,049 Average sales prices (excluding hedging): Crude oil (per bbl) $ 53.31 $ 39.25 $ 28.42 NGLs (per bbl) 31.52 23.73 18.75 Natural gas (per mcf) 7.98 5.79 5.10 Total (per mcfe) (a) 7.98 5.80 4.94 Average sales prices (including hedging): Crude oil (per bbl) $ 38.71 $ 28.04 $ 23.53 NGLs (per bbl) 27.27 19.76 18.75 Natural gas (per mcf) 6.03 4.45 3.94 Total (per mcfe) (a) 6.02 4.40 3.90 (a) Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcfe. 24 Table of Contents Overview Our 2005 performance reflects the benefits of higher oil and gas production, higher oil and gas prices and continued focus upon our cost structure. The business of exploring for, developing, and acquiring oil and gas is highly competitive and capital intensive. As in any commodity business, the costs associated with finding, acquiring, extracting, and financing the operation are critical to profitability and long term value creation for stockholders. Generating meaningful growth while containing costs represents an ongoing challenge for management. During periods of historically high oil and gas prices, such as 2005, drilling service and operating cost increases are more prevalent due to increased competition for goods and services. We faced other challenges in 2005 including attracting and retaining qualified personnel, consummating and integrating acquisitions, and accessing the capital markets to fund our growth and capital simplification process on sufficiently favorable terms. We have continued to expand and improve the technical staff through the hiring of additional experienced professionals. Our inventory of exploration and development prospects continues to build, providing new growth opportunities, greater diversification of technical risk and better efficiency. Revenues increased 67% in 2005 over the same period of 2004. This increase is due to higher production and realized oil and gas prices. Our 2005 production growth is due to acquisitions completed in 2004 and to the continued success of our drilling program. Realized prices were higher by 37% in 2005 reflecting higher market prices and the expiration of lower priced oil and gas hedges. Since December 31, 2005, oil and gas prices have remained volatile, particularly the price of natural gas. On February 17, 2006, the NYMEX spot price for natural gas closed at $7.18 per Mmbtu which is significantly below the market price at the end of the year. As discussed in Item 1A of this report, significant changes in oil and gas prices can have a significant impact on our balance sheet and our results of operations, particularly on the fair value of our derivatives. Comparison of 2005 to 2004 Net income increased $68.8 million, with higher average oil and gas prices and volumes as primary factors contributing to this increase. Increased revenues were partially offset by higher operating costs and higher DDA. Average realized price received for oil and gas during 2005 was $6.02 per mcfe, up 37% or $1.62 per mcfe from 2004. Oil and gas revenues for 2005 reached a record $525.1 million and were 66% higher than 2004 due to higher oil and gas prices and a 22% increase in production. The average price received increased 38% to $38.71 per barrel for oil and increased 36% to $6.03 per mcf for gas from 2004. The effect of our hedging program decreased realized prices $1.96 per mcfe in 2005 versus a decrease of $1.40 in 2004. Production volume increased 22% from 2004 due to our drilling program and additions from acquisitions consummated in 2004, primarily our purchase of the 50% of Great Lakes that we did not own and Pine Mountain. Production increased 15.5 Bcfe from 2004. Our production volumes increased 69% in our Appalachia Division, increased 14% in our Southwest Division and declined 26% in our Gulf Coast Division. Transportation and gathering revenue of $2.6 million increased $376,000 from 2004. This increase is primarily due to higher gas prices and additional throughput volumes offset by lower oil marketing revenue. Mark to market on oil and gas derivatives includes a gain of $10.9 million in 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2005, certain of our gas hedges no longer qualify for hedge accounting due to the effect of recent volatility of gas prices on the correlation between realized prices and hedge reference prices. Other revenue declined in 2005 to a loss of $2.6 million from a gain of $2.8 million in 2004. The 2005 period includes ineffective hedging losses due to widening basis differentials of $3.4 million offset by net IPF income of $514,000. The 2004 period includes a gain on the sale of properties of $5.0 million and $712,000 of ineffective hedging gains offset by $2.0 million write down of an insurance claim receivable. Other revenue for 2004 also includes net IPF expenses of $1.8 million. Direct operating expense increased $20.3 million to $66.6 million due to increased costs from acquisitions, higher oilfield service costs and higher workover costs primarily in our Gulf Coast Division. Our operating expenses are increasing as we add new wells and maintain production from our existing properties. We incurred $7.4 million of expenses associated with workovers in 2005 versus $1.8 million in 2004. In 2005, 58% of our workover expenses were incurred by our Gulf Coast Division and were primarily hurricane related. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expenses were $0.76 per mcfe and increased $0.11 per mcfe from 2004 consisting of higher field level costs of $0.04 and higher workover costs of $0.07. 25 Table of Contents Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices and not hedged prices. These taxes increased $11.0 million, or 54%, from the same period of the prior year. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes increased from $0.29 per mcfe to $0.36 per mcfe due to higher market prices. Exploration expense increased 39% to $29.4 million due to higher seismic costs ($10.5 million) and higher personnel costs, partially offset by lower dry hole costs ($5.0 million). Exploration expense includes exploration personnel costs of $6.0 million in 2005 versus $4.4 million in 2004. General and administrative expense for 2005 increased 43%, or $8.8 million, from 2004 with additional personnel costs due to the Great Lakes and Pine Mountain acquisitions ($1.8 million), higher salaries and benefits ($3.5 million), higher legal expenses ($1.3 million) and a $725,000 legal settlement accrual (See also Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements). On a per mcfe basis, general and administration expense increased from $0.29 per mcfe in 2004 to $0.34 per mcfe in 2005. Non cash stock compensation increased 84%, or $16.1 million, from 2004. This non cash expense relates to the increase in value of our common stock and other investments held in our deferred compensation plans. Our common stock price increased from $13.64 per share at the end of 2004 to $26.34 per share, at the end of 2005. The twelve months ended December 31, 2005 also includes $5.8 million mark to market expense for stock appreciation rights issued in 2005. Interest expense for 2005 increased $15.7 million, or 68%, to $38.8 million with higher average interest rates, higher average debt balances and the refinancing of certain debt from short term floating to longer term fixed rates. In March 2005, we issued $150.0 million of 6.375% senior subordinated notes which added $7.8 million of interest costs. The proceeds from this issuance were used to retire lower interest bank debt. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility was $314.8 million and $296.6 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively, and the average interest rates were 4.3% and 3.5%, respectively. Depletion, depreciation and amortization, or DDA, increased $24.5 million, or 24%, due to higher production and higher depletion rates. DDA increased from $1.39 per mcfe in 2004 to $1.46 per mcfe in 2005. The twelve months ended December 31, 2004 includes a $3.6 million impairment charge on an offshore property in our Gulf Coast Division. For 2006, based on our current reserve base, we expect our DDA rate to average approximately $1.55 per mcfe. Tax expense for 2005 increased $41.8 million, or 170%, over 2004 due to a 166% increase in income before taxes. Our effective tax rate for 2005 and 2004 was 37%. Given our available net operating loss carryforward, we do not expect to pay significant federal income taxes; however, we do expect to pay $1.1 million of state income taxes. The following table presents information about our operating expenses per mcfe for 2005 and 2004. Operating expenses per mcfe 2005 2004 Change % Direct operating expense $ 0.76 $ 0.65 $ 0.11 17 % Production and ad valorem tax expense 0.36 0.29 0.07 24 % General and administration expense 0.34 0.29 0.05 17 % Interest expense 0.44 0.32 0.12 38 % Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense (excluding impairment in 2004) 1.46 1.39 0.07 5 % 26 Table of Contents Comparison of 2004 to 2003 Net income increased $6.8 million, with higher average oil and gas prices and volumes as a primary factor contributing to this increase. Increased revenues were partially offset by higher operating costs and higher DDA. The year ended 2003 included an $18.5 million gain on retirement of debt and convertible securities versus a loss of $39,000 in 2004. The year ended 2003 also included a $4.5 million favorable cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. Average realized price received for oil and gas during 2004 was $4.40 per mcfe, up 13%, or $0.50 per mcfe, from 2003. Oil and gas revenues for 2004 reached $315.7 million and were 39% higher than 2003 due to higher oil and gas prices and a 24% increase in production. The average price received increased 19% to $28.04 per barrel for oil and increased 13% to $4.45 per mcf for gas from 2003. The effect of our hedging program decreased realized prices $1.40 per mcfe in 2004 versus a decrease of $1.04 in 2003. Production volume increased 24% from 2003 due to our drilling program and additions from acquisitions consummated in late 2003 and 2004, primarily the Conger Field acquisition in 2003 and our purchase of the 50% of Great Lakes that we did not own in 2004. Production increased 13.7 Bcfe from 2003. Our production volumes increased 56% in our Appalachian Division, increased 30% in our Southwestern Division and declined 14% in our Gulf Coast Division. Transportation and gathering revenue of $2.2 million declined $1.3 million from 2003. This decline is due to lower oil marketing revenues and additional gas transportation system employee expense related to the Conger Field acquisition ($1.1 million) partially offset by additional revenue related to the Great Lakes acquisition. Gain (loss) on retirement of securities was a loss of $39,000 in 2004 versus a gain of $19.0 million in 2003. The year ended 2004 includes the purchase for cash of $2.7 million of 6% debentures. During 2003, 193,500 shares of common stock were exchanged for $880,000 of 6% debentures with a conversion expense of $465,000 recorded on the exchange. In addition, 2003 included $9.1 million of 6% debentures, $500,000 of 8.75% Notes, and $5.3 million of Trust Preferred Securities were repurchased for cash. Also in 2003, $10.2 million of cash and $50.0 million of our newly issued convertible preferred stock was exchanged for $79.5 million of Trust Preferred Securities. Other revenue increased in 2004 to $2.8 million from a loss of $2.7 million in 2003. The 2004 period includes a gain on the sale of properties of $5.0 million and $712,000 of ineffective hedging gains offset by $2.0 million write down of an insurance claim receivable. Other revenue for 2004 also includes net IPF expenses of $1.8 million. Other revenue in 2003 includes an ineffective hedging loss of $1.2 million and net IPF expenses of $1.4 million. Direct operating expense increased $9.9 million to $46.3 million due to increased costs from acquisitions and higher oilfield service costs. Our operating expenses are increasing as we add new wells and maintain production from our existing properties. We incurred $1.8 million of expenses associated with workovers in 2004 versus $2.7 million in 2003. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expenses increased $0.02 per mcfe with higher field level costs offset by lower workover costs. Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices and not hedged prices. These taxes increased $7.6 million, or 59%, from the same period of the prior year. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes increased from $0.22 per mcfe to $0.29 per mcfe due to higher market prices. Exploration expense increased 52% to $21.2 million due to higher dry hole costs ($8.5 million) and higher personnel costs partially offset by lower seismic purchases ($2.6 million). Exploration expense includes exploration personnel costs of $4.4 million in 2004 versus $3.3 million in 2003. General and administrative expense for 2004 increased 16%, or $2.8 million, from 2003 due primarily to higher professional fees and additional personnel costs due to the Great Lakes acquisition. On a per mcfe basis, general and administrative expense declined from $0.31 per mcfe in 2003 to $0.29 per mcfe in 2004. Non cash stock compensation increased $12.6 million from 2003. This non cash expense relates to the increase in value of our common stock and other investments held in our deferred compensation plans. Our common stock price increased from $6.30 per share at the end of 2003 to $13.64 per share at the end of 2004. Interest expense for 2004 increased $1.0 million, or 4%, to $23.1 million with higher interest rates and average debt balance partially offset by a lower call premiums of $1.8 million. Interest expense for 2003 included a $2.0 million call premium on the 8.75% Notes. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility was $262.4 million and $104.7 million for 2004 and 2003, respectively and the average interest rates were 3.3% and 3.1%, respectively. 27 Table of Contents Depletion, depreciation and amortization, or DDA, increased $16.4 million, or 19%, to $103.0 million due to higher production and a $3.6 million (or $0.05 per mcfe) impairment charge on an offshore property in our Gulf Coast division. The impairment was attributable to hurricane damage and related production declines. On a per mcfe basis, excluding the impairment charge on the offshore property, DDA declined from $1.49 per mcfe to $1.39 per mcfe. For 2005, based on our current reserve base, we expect our DDA rate to average $1.45 per mcfe. Tax expense for 2004 increased $6.1 million, or 33%, over 2003 due to a 35% increase in income before taxes. Year end 2004 and 2003 provide for a tax rate of 37%. Given our available net operating loss carryforward, we do not expect to pay significant cash federal income taxes. The following table presents information about our operating expenses for each of the years in the two year period ended December 31, 2004. Operating expenses per mcfe 2004 2003 Change % Direct operating expense $ 0.65 $ 0.63 $ 0.02 3 % Production and ad valorem tax expense 0.29 0.22 0.07 32 % General and administration expense 0.29 0.31 (0.02 ) (6 %) Interest expense 0.32 0.38 (0.06 ) (16 %) Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense (excluding impairment in 2004) 1.39 1.49 (0.10 ) (7 %) 28 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity During 2005, our cash provided from operations was $325.7 million, and we spent $441.8 million on capital expenditures (including acquisitions). During this period, financing activities provided net cash of $93.0 million. Our financing activity included the sale in March 2005 of $150.0 million of 6.375% Notes that enabled us to better match the maturities of our debt with the life of our properties and decrease our interest rate volatility. In addition, in June 2005 we issued 6.9 million common shares in a public offering for net proceeds of $109.2 million. At December 31, 2005 we had $4.7 million in cash, total assets of $2.0 billion and a debt to capitalization ratio of 47%. Long term debt at December 31, 2005 totaled $616.1 million, including $269.2 million of bank debt and $346.9 million of senior subordinated notes. Available borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility at December 31, 2005 was $330.8 million. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves which is typical in the oil and gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We believe that net cash generated from operating activities and unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility combined with our oil and gas price hedges currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near term financial obligations and liquidity needs. However, long term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and gas business. A material drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, reduce debt, meet financial obligations and remain profitable. We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of oil and gas, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proved reserves. In 2004, we filed a new universal shelf registration statement with the SEC registering $500.0 million aggregate amount of common stock, preferred stock and other equity and debt securities. In December 2004, we issued 8.6 million shares of common stock under this shelf registration statement for an aggregate price of $107.8 million. In June 2005, we issued 6.9 million shares of common stock under this shelf registration for an aggregate price of $113.9 million. As of December 31, 2005, we have $278.3 million of capacity remaining under the shelf. Range qualifies as a Well Known Seasoned Issuer. Bank Debt We maintain a $600.0 million revolving credit facility, which we refer to as our bank debt or our bank credit facility. The bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and matures on January 1, 2009. Availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the banks semi annually and more often in certain other circumstances. The borrowing base is dependent on a number of factors, primarily the lenders assessment of future cash flows. Redeterminations of the borrowing base require approval of 75% of the lenders; increases require unanimous approval. At February 20, 2006, the bank credit facility had a $600.0 million borrowing base of which $310.7 million was available. Limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments as defined are imposed under our bank debt, the 7.375% Notes and the 6.375% Notes. Under the bank credit facility, common and preferred dividends are permitted. The terms of both the 7.375% Notes and the 6.375% Notes limit restricted payments (including dividends) to the greater of $20.0 million or a formula based on earnings and equity issuances since the original issuances of the notes. At December 31, 2005, approximately $432.9 million was available under the restricted payment baskets for both the 6.375% Notes and the 7.375% Notes. The bank credit facility provides for a restricted payment basket of $20.0 million plus 66 2/3% of net cash proceeds from common stock issuances and 50% of net income. Approximately $365.8 million was available under the bank credit facility restricted payment basket as of December 31, 2005. The debt agreements contain customary covenants relating to debt incurrence, working capital, dividends and financial ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2005. Cash Flow Our principal sources of cash are operating cash flow, bank borrowings and at times, issuance of debt and equity securities. Our operating cash flow is highly dependent on oil and gas prices. As of December 31, 2005, we had entered into hedging agreements covering 61.2 Bcfe, 43.7 Bcfe and 14.3 Bcfe for 2006, 2007 and 2008, respectively. The $288.2 million 29 Table of Contents of cash capital expenditures for 2005, excluding acquisitions, was funded with internal cash flow. The $429.0 million capital budget for 2006, which excludes acquisitions, is expected to increase production and to expand the reserve base. Based on current projections, oil and gas futures prices and our hedge position, the 2006 capital program is expected to be funded with internal cash flow. Net cash provided from operating activities in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $325.7 million, $209.2 million and $124.7 million, respectively. In 2005, cash flow from operations increased due to higher production volumes and prices partially offset by increasing operating, exploration and interest expenses. In 2004, cash flow from operations increased due to higher volumes and prices partially offset by increasing operating and exploration expenses. In 2003, cash flow from operations increased with higher volumes and higher prices partially offset by increasing operating and exploration expenses. Net cash used in investing activities in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $432.4 million, $624.3 million and $186.8 million, respectively. In 2005, we spent $276.9 million in additions to oil and gas properties and $153.6 million on acquisitions. The 2004 period included $166.6 million in additions to oil and gas properties and $485.6 million of acquisitions. The 2003 period included $91.2 million in additions to oil and gas properties, and $103.9 million of acquisitions, partially offset by $10.3 million of IPF net repayments. Net cash provided from financing activities in 2005, 2004 and 2003 was $93.0 million, $432.8 million and $61.5 million, respectively. Historically, sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and debt offerings. During 2005, we received proceeds of $150.0 million and $109.2 million from the issuance of our 6.375% Notes and a common stock offering. During 2005, the outstanding balance under our bank credit facility declined $154.7 million primarily due to the proceeds received from the 6.375% Notes being applied to our bank debt. During 2004, we received proceeds of $98.1 million and $246.1 million from the issuance of additional 7.375% Notes and two common stock offerings, respectively. During 2004, the outstanding balance under our bank credit facility increased $245.7 million with $70.0 million related to the Great Lakes transaction and the remaining increase the result of funding other acquisitions. Also in 2004, we redeemed the remaining outstanding 6% Debentures for $11.6 million. During 2003, the outstanding balance under our bank credit facility increased $62.4 million primarily due to the December acquisition of producing properties in the Conger field. In 2003, total debt declined $9.9 million. During 2003, we redeemed $84.8 million of the Trust Preferred Securities and $69.3 million of the 8.75% Notes and issued $100.0 million of 7.375% Notes. Capital Requirements Our primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends. During 2005, $288.2 million of capital was expended primarily on drilling projects. Also in 2005, $153.6 million was expended on acquisitions primarily to purchase producing properties. The capital program, excluding acquisitions, was funded by net cash flow from operations and our acquisitions were funded primarily with proceeds received from our common stock offering. The 2006 capital budget of $429.0 million, excluding acquisitions, is expected to be funded by cash flow from operations. Development and exploration activities are highly discretionary, and, for the foreseeable future, we expect such activities to be maintained at levels equal to or below internal cash flow. To the extent capital requirements exceed internal cash flow, debt or equity may be issued to fund these requirements. We currently believe we have sufficient liquidity and cash flow to meet our obligations for the next twelve months; however, a drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production or reserves could adversely affect our ability to fund capital expenditures and meet our financial obligations. Also, our obligations may change due to acquisitions, divestitures and continued growth. We may issue additional shares of stock, subordinated notes or other debt securities to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, extend maturities or to repay debt. Cash Dividend Payments The amount of future dividends is subject to declaration by the board of directors and depends on earnings, capital expenditures and various other factors, such as restrictions under our bank debt and the 7.375% Notes and the 6.375% Notes. In 2005, we paid $7.6 million in dividends to our common stockholders ($0.02 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.0133 per share in the third, second and first quarter). In 2004, we paid $3.2 million in dividends to our common stockholders ($0.0067 per share in the second and third quarter and $0.0133 per share in the fourth quarter). In 2005, 2004 and 2003, we paid $2.2 million, $2.9 million and $803,000 in preferred stock dividends. As of December 31, 2004, our 5.9% convertible preferred stock was converted to common stock. Future Commitments In addition to our capital expenditure program, we are committed to making cash payments in the future on two types of contracts: note agreements and operating leases. As of December 31, 2005, we do not have any capital leases nor 30 Table of Contents have we entered into any material long term contracts for drilling rigs or equipment. As of December 31, 2005, we do not have any off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party. The table below provides estimates of the timing of future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place at December 31, 2005. In addition to the contractual obligations listed on the table below, our balance sheet at December 31, 2005 reflects accrued interest payable on our bank debt of $652,000 which is payable in January 2006. We expect to make annual interest payments of $14.8 million per year on our $200.0 million of 7.375% Notes and payments of $9.6 million per year on our $150.0 million of 6.375% Notes. The following summarizes our contractual financial obligations at December 31, 2005 and their future maturities. We expect to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities and refinancing proceeds. Payment due by period 2007 and 2009 and 2006 2008 2010 Thereafter Total (in thousands) Bank debt due 2009 $ $ $ 269,200 (a) $ $ 269,200 7.375% senior subordinated notes due 2013 200,000 200,000 6.375% senior subordinated notes due 2015 150,000 150,000 Operating leases 2,953 3,622 1,860 8,435 Seismic purchase 400 400 800 Derivative obligations (b) 160,101 70,948 231,049 Asset retirement obligation liability 3,166 3,715 4,186 56,996 68,063 Total contractual obligations (c) $ 166,620 $ 78,685 $ 275,246 $ 406,996 $ 927,547 (a) Due at termination date of our bank credit facility, which we expect to renew, but there is no assurance that can be accomplished. Interest paid on our bank credit facility would be approximately $14.5 million each year assuming no change in the interest rate or outstanding balance. (b) Derivative obligations represent net open derivative contracts valued as of December 31, 2005. (c) This table does not include the liability for the deferred compensation plans since these obligations will be funded with existing plan assets. Hedging Oil and Gas Prices We enter into hedging agreements to reduce the impact of oil and gas price volatility on our operations. At December 31, 2005, swaps were in place covering 6.7 Bcf of gas at prices averaging $6.60 per mcf and 0.1 million barrels of oil at prices averaging $35.00 per barrel. We also had collars covering 82.8 Bcf of gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of $6.77 to $9.43 and 4.8 million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of $45.21 to $56.58. The hedges fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination, based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX, approximated a pretax loss of $231.0 million at December 31, 2005. The contracts expire monthly through December 2008. Transaction gains and losses are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases on oil and gas revenue in the period the hedged production is sold. Realized hedging losses of $171.1 million $100.1 million and $60.4 million were realized in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Changes in the value of the ineffective portion of all open hedges are recognized in earnings quarterly in other income. Unrealized effective gains and losses on hedging positions are recorded at an estimate of fair value based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX, on our consolidated balance sheet as other comprehensive income, or OCI, a component of stockholders equity. As of the fourth quarter of 2005, certain of our gas hedges no longer qualify for hedge accounting due to the effect of recent volatility of gas prices on the correlation between realized prices and hedge reference prices and were marked to market in the amount of a gain of $10.9 million. 31 Table of Contents At December 31, 2005, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding: Period Contract Type Volume Hedged Average Hedge Price Natural gas 2006 Swaps 10,788 Mmbtu/day $6.43 2006 Collars 113,363 Mmbtu/day $6.37 $8.70 2007 Swaps 7,500 Mmbtu/day $6.86 2007 Collars 83,500 Mmbtu/day $6.93 $9.63 2008 Collars 30,000 Mmbtu/day $7.81 $11.65 Crude Oil 2006 Swaps 400 bbl/day $35.00 2006 Collars 6,864 bbl/day $39.83 $49.05 2007 Collars 4,800 bbl/day $51.42 $61.87 2008 Collars 1,500 bbl/day $50.00 $74.12 Interest Rates At December 31, 2005, we had $616.1 million of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $350.0 million bears interest at a fixed rate averaging 7.0%. Bank debt totaling $269.2 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 5.4% at year end 2005, excluding interest rate swaps. At December 31, 2005, we had fixed rate interest rate swap agreements on notional debt of $35.0 million. These swaps consist of two agreements at 1.8% which expire in June 2006. The 90 day LIBOR rate on December 31, 2005 was 4.5%. A 1% increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2005 would cost us approximately $2.3 million in additional annual interest, net of swaps. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements to enhance liquidity and capital resource position, or for any other purpose. Inflation and Changes in Prices Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Oil and gas prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. In 2005 and 2004, we experienced an overall increase in drilling and service costs compared to 2003, especially with regard to steel products. We expect further increases in these costs for 2006. 32 Table of Contents The following table indicates the average oil and gas prices received over the last five years and quarterly for 2005, 2004 and 2003. Average price calculations exclude hedging gains and losses. Oil is converted to natural gas equivalent at the rate of one barrel equals six mcfe.

The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. Actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. Certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if a) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to changes; and b) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Property, Plant and Equipment Proved reserves are defined by the SEC as those volumes of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Although our engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. Reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revisions, which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price and cost changes and other economic factors. Changes in oil and gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions in turn cause adjustments in the depletion rates utilized by us. We cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods. Reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our Vice President of Reservoir Engineering who reports directly to our Chief Operating Officer. In addition, because substantially all of our proved reserves are pledged as collateral for our bank credit facility, our estimates of proved reserves are reviewed twice annually by independent engineers on behalf of each of the sixteen banks participating in our bank credit facility. To further ensure the reliability of our reserve estimates, we engage independent petroleum consultants to review our estimates of proved reserves. The following table sets forth a summary of the percent of reserves which were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2005, 2004 and 2003. Audited (a) 2005 2004 2003 84% 88% 87% (a) Audited reserves are those reserves estimated by our employees and reviewed by an independent petroleum consultant. We utilize the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures. Unsuccessful exploration drilling costs are expensed and can have a significant effect on reported operating results. Successful exploration drilling costs and all development costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and gas reserves as estimated by our engineers and reviewed by independent engineers. Costs incurred for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot yet be classified as proved are capitalized on our balance sheet if (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and (b) we are making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Otherwise, well costs are expensed if a determination as to whether proved reserves were found cannot be made within one year following completion of drilling and these criteria are not met. Proven property leasehold costs are charged to expense using the units of production method based on total proved reserves. Unproved properties are assessed periodically (at least annually) and impairments to value are charged to expense. The successful efforts method inherently relies upon the estimation of proved reserves, which includes proved developed and proved undeveloped volumes. We adhere to the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies, for recognizing any impairment of capitalized costs to unproved properties. The greatest portion of these costs generally relate to the acquisition of leasehold costs. The costs are capitalized and periodically evaluated (at least annually) as to recoverability, based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in 34 Table of Contents business strategy employed by management. We consider a combination of time, geologic and engineering factors to evaluate the need for impairment of these costs. Unproved properties had a net book value of $28.6 million, $14.8 million and $12.2 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Depletion rates are determined based on reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of producing properties. As the estimated reserves are adjusted, the depletion expense for a property will change, assuming no change in production volumes or the capitalized costs. Estimated reserves are used as the basis for calculating the expected future cash flows from a property, which are used to determine whether that property may be impaired. Reserves are also used to estimate the supplemental disclosure of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas producing activities and reserve quantities in Note 16, Supplemental Information on Natural Gas and Oil Exploration, Development and Production Activities to our consolidated financial statements. Changes in the estimated reserves are considered in estimates for accounting purposes and are reflected on a prospective basis. We monitor our long lived assets recorded in property, plant and equipment in our consolidated balance sheet to ensure they are fairly presented. We must evaluate our properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices, an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and gas reserves that will be produced from a field, the timing of future production, future production costs, future abandonment costs, and future inflation. The need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors, including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or gas, unfavorable adjustment to reserves, physical damage to production equipment and facilities, a change in costs, or other changes to contracts, environmental regulations or tax laws. All of these factors must be considered when testing a propertys carrying value for impairment. We cannot predict whether impairment charges may be required in the future. Derivatives We use commodity derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil and gas price volatility. We account for our commodity derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. Earnings are affected by the ineffective portion of a hedge contract (changes in realized prices that do not match the changes in the hedge price). Ineffective gains or losses are recorded in other revenue while the hedge contract is open and may increase or reverse until settlement of the contract. This may result in significant volatility to current period income. For derivatives qualifying as hedges, the effective portion of any changes in fair value is recognized in stockholders equity as OCI, and then reclassified to earnings, in oil and gas revenue, when the transaction is consummated. This may result in significant volatility in stockholders equity. The fair value of open hedging contracts is an estimated amount that could be realized upon termination. As of the fourth quarter of 2005, certain of our gas hedges no longer qualified for hedge accounting due to the volatility of gas prices and their effect on our basis differentials and were marked to market. The commodity derivatives we use include commodity collars and swaps. While there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising prices may not be captured, we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important. Among these benefits are a more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions, the flexibility to enter into long term projects requiring substantial committed capital, smoother and more efficient execution of our ongoing development drilling and production enhancement programs, more consistent returns on invested capital, and better access to bank and other credit markets. We also have two interest rate swap agreements to help protect against the volatility of variable interest rates under our bank credit facility. Asset Retirement Obligations We have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires us to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. Inherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate retirement costs, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of retirement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation, or ARO liability, a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. In addition, increases in the discounted ARO liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense, a component of DDA, in our consolidated statement of operations. 35 Table of Contents Deferred Taxes We are subject to income and other taxes in all areas in which we operate. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required because income tax returns are generally filed many months after the close of a calendar year, tax returns are subject to audit which can take years to complete and future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized. We have deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences. We routinely evaluate deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization. A valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when we believe that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized. In determining deferred tax liabilities, accounting rules require OCI to be considered, even though such income (loss) has not yet been earned. At year end 2004, deferred tax liabilities exceeded deferred tax assets by $91.4 million with $26.0 million of deferred tax assets related to unrealized deferred hedging losses included in OCI. At year end 2005, deferred tax liabilities exceeded deferred tax assets by $113.1 million, with $85.5 million of deferred tax assets related to unrealized deferred hedging losses included in OCI. Based on our expectations regarding future profitability and market prices for oil and gas, the unrealized hedging losses are expected to be offset in the future by higher realization on our production and no year end 2005 valuation allowance was deemed necessary. We may be challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in our various income tax returns. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for all taxes, gains or losses could occur in the future due to changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding tax matters. Contingent Liabilities A provision for legal, environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost or range of cost can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal, environmental and contingent matters. In addition, we often must estimate the amount of such losses. In many cases, our judgment is based on the input of our legal advisors and on the interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or the courts. We monitor known and potential legal, environmental and other contingent matters and make our best estimate of when to record losses for these matters based on available information. Although we continue to monitor all contingencies closely, particularly our outstanding litigation, we currently have no material accruals for contingent liabilities. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued FASB Statements No. 123 (revised 2004) Share Based Payment, or SFAS 123(R), which is a revision of FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS 123(R) supersedes APB opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to employees, and amends FASB Statement No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS 123(R) is similar to the approach described in Statement 123. However, SFAS 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statements based on their fair values rather than pro forma footnote disclosure. SFAS 123(R) permits companies to adopt its requirements using either a modified prospective method, or a modified retrospective method. Under the modified prospective method, compensation cost is recognized in the financial statements beginning with the effective date, based on the requirements of SFAS 123(R) for all share based payments granted after that date, and based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all unvested awards granted prior to the effective date of SFAS 123(R). Under the modified retrospective method, the requirements are the same as under the modified prospective method, but also permits entities to restate financial statements of previous periods based on pro forma disclosures made in accordance with SFAS 123. We currently anticipate we will adopt the provisions of SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective method on January 1, 2006. We currently utilize a standard option pricing model (i.e., Black Scholes) to measure the fair value of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted. While SFAS 123(R) permits entities to continue to use such a model, the standard also permits the use of a lattice binomial model. We currently anticipate we will continue using the standard option pricing model (i.e. Black Sholes) upon adoption of SFAS 123(R). The adoption of SFAS 123(R) will have a significant impact on our results of operations, although it will have no impact on our overall financial position. The impact of adoption of Statement 123(R) cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future. However, had we adopted Statement 123(R) 36 Table of Contents in prior periods, the impact of that standard would have approximated the impact of Statement 123 as described in the disclosure of pro forma net income and earnings per share as shown in Note 2 Stock Based Compensation in our consolidated financial statements. Statement 123(R) also requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption, to the extent of associated tax benefits that may be realized in the future. While we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options), there was no impact on our net operating cash flows in 2005, 2004 or 2003, respectively, as we were not able to recognize a cash benefit due to our net operating loss carryforward tax position. In May 2005, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statements No. 3 or SFAS 154. SFAS 154 provides guidance on the accounting for a reporting of accounting changes and error corrections. It establishes, unless impracticable, retrospective application as the required method for reporting a change in accounting principle in the absence of explicit transition requirements specific to SFAS 154. The provisions of SFAS 154 shall be effective for accounting changes and corrections of errors made in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2005. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposure. All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are US dollar denominated. Market Risk Our major market risk is exposure to oil and gas prices. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American gas production. Oil and gas prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. Commodity Price Risk We periodically enter into hedging arrangements with respect to our oil and gas production. Hedging is intended to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations. Certain of our hedges are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our hedging program also includes collars which assume a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. In times of increasing price volatility, we may experience losses from our hedging arrangements and increased basis differentials at the delivery points where we market our production. Widening basis differentials occur when the physical delivery market prices do not increase proportionately to the increased prices in the financial trading markets. Realized gains and losses are recognized in oil and gas revenues when the associated production occurs. Gains or losses on open contracts are recorded either in current period income or other comprehensive income, or OCI. Generally, derivative losses occur when market prices increase, which are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transaction. Conversely, derivative gains occur when market prices decrease, which are offset by losses on the underlying commodity transaction. Ineffective gains and losses are recognized in earnings as a component of other revenue. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes. As of December 31, 2005, we had oil and gas swaps in place covering 6.7 billion Bcf of gas and 0.1 million barrels of oil. We also had collars covering 82.8 Bcf of gas and 4.8 million barrels of oil. These contracts expire monthly through December 2008. The fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of December 31, 2005, approximated a net pre tax loss of $231.0 million. Gains or losses realized on hedging transactions are determined monthly based upon the difference between contract price received by us for the sale of our hedged production and the hedge price, generally closing prices on the NYMEX. These gains and losses are included as increases or decreases to oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold. In 2005, 2004 and 2003, pre tax losses were realized in the amount of $171.1 million, $100.1 million and $60.4 million, respectively, relating to our hedges. Losses due to commodity hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings in other revenues in our consolidated statement of operations. The ineffective portion of hedges recorded was a loss of $3.4 million in 2005, a gain of $712,000 in 2004 and a loss of $1.2 million in 2003. As of the fourth quarter of 2005, certain of our gas hedges no longer qualify for hedge accounting due to the volatility in gas prices and its effect on our basis differentials and were marked to market as a gain of $10.9 million. At December 31, 2005, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding: Period Contract Type Volume Hedged Average Hedge Price Natural gas 2006 Swaps 10,788 Mmbtu/day $6.43 2006 Collars 113,363 Mmbtu/day $6.37 $8.70 2007 Swaps 7,500 Mmbtu/day $6.86 2007 Collars 83,500 Mmbtu/day $6.93 $9.63 2008 Collars 30,000 Mmbtu/day $7.81 $11.65 Crude Oil 2006 Swaps 400 bbl/day $35.00 2006 Collars 6,864 bbl/day $39.83 $49.05 2007 Collars 4,800 bbl/day $51.42 $61.87 2008 Collars 1,500 bbl/day $50.00 $74.12 38 Table of Contents In 2005, a 10% reduction in oil and gas prices, excluding amounts fixed through hedging transactions, would have reduced revenue by $70.0 million. If oil and gas futures prices at December 31, 2005 had declined by 10%, the unrealized hedging loss at that date would have decreased $118.2 million. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2005, we had $616.1 million of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $350.0 million bears interest at a fixed rate averaging 7.0%. Bank debt totaling $269.2 million bears interest at floating rates, excluding interest rate swaps, which averaged 5.4% on that date. At December 31, 2005, we had fixed rate interest rate swap agreements totaling $35.0 million. These swaps consist of two agreements at 1.8% which expire in June 2006. On December 31, 2005, the 90 day LIBOR rate was 4.5%. A 1% increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding (net of amounts fixed through hedging transactions) at December 31, 2005 would cost us approximately $2.3 million in additional annual interest rates, net of swaps.
