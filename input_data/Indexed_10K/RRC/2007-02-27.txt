Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk. Proximity to local markets, availability of competitive fuels and overall supply and demand are factors affecting the prices for which our production can be sold. Market volatility due to international political developments, overall energy supply and demand, fluctuating weather conditions, economic growth rates and other factors in the United States and worldwide has had, and will continue to have, a significant effect on energy prices. We incur gathering and transportation expenses to move our natural gas and crude oil from the wellhead and tanks to purchaser specified delivery points. These expenses vary based on volume, distance shipped and the fee charged by the third party transporters. In the Southwestern and Gulf Coast Divisions, our natural gas and oil production are transported primarily through third party trucks, gathering systems and pipelines. Transportation space on these gathering systems and pipelines is occasionally limited. In Appalachia, we own approximately 4,900 miles of gas gathering pipelines which transport a majority of our Appalachian gas production as well as third party gas to transmission lines and directly to end users and interstate pipelines. For additional information, see Risk Factors Our business depends on oil and natural gas transportation facilities, many of which are owned by others, in Item 1A. of this report. 5 Table of Contents Governmental Regulation Our operations are substantially affected by federal, state and local laws and regulations. In particular, oil and gas production and related operations are, or have been, subject to price controls, taxes and numerous other laws and regulations. All of the jurisdictions in which we own or operate producing crude oil and natural gas properties have statutory provisions regulating the exploration for and production of crude oil and natural gas, including provisions related to permits for the drilling of wells, bonding requirements in order to drill or operate wells, the location of wells, the method of drilling and casing wells, the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled, and the abandonment of wells. Our operations are also subject to various conservation laws and regulations. These include the regulation of the size of drilling and spacing units or proration units, the number of wells which may be drilled in an area, and the unitization or pooling of crude oil and natural gas wells, generally prohibit the venting or flaring of natural gas, and impose certain requirements regarding the ratability or fair apportionment of production from fields and individuals wells. Certain operations that we conduct are on federal oil and gas leases which are administered by the Minerals Management Service (MMS). These leases contain relatively standardized terms and require compliance with detailed MMS regulations pursuant to the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act, (OCSLA) (which are subject to change by the MMS). Lessees must obtain a permit from the MMS prior to the commencement of drilling, and comply with regulation governing, among other things, engineering, and construction specifications for production facilities, safety procedures, plugging and abandonment of Outer Continental Shelf, (OCS), wells, the valuation of production, and the removal of facilities. Under certain circumstances, the MMS may require our operations on federal leases to be suspended or terminated. Any such suspension or termination could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operation. To cover the various obligations of lessees on the OCS, the MMS generally requires that lessees post substantial bonds or other acceptable assurances that such obligations will be met, unless the MMS exempts the lessee from such obligations. The cost of such bonds or other surety can be substantial and we can provide no assurance that we can continue to obtain bonds or other surety in all cases. In August 2005, Congress enacted the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005). Among other matters, the EPAct 2005 amends the Natural Gas Act (NGA), to make it unlawful for any entity, including otherwise non jurisdictional producers such as Range, to use any deceptive or manipulative device or contrivance in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to regulation by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), in contravention of rules prescribed by the FERC. On January 20, 2006, the FERC issued rules implementing this provision. The rules make it unlawful in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of FERC, for any entity, directly or indirectly, to use or employ any device, scheme or artifice to defraud; to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading; or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person. EPAct 2005 also gives the FERC authority to impose civil penalties for violations of the NGA up to $1,000,000 per day per violation. The new anti manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non jurisdictional sale or gathering, but does apply to activities or otherwise non jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted in connection with gas sales, purchases or transportation subject to FERC jurisdiction. It therefore reflects a significant expansion of FERCs enforcement authority. Range does not anticipate it will be affected any differently than other producers of natural gas. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations can result in substantial penalties. The regulatory burden on the industry increases the cost of doing business and affects profitability. Although we believe we are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations, such laws and regulations are frequently amended or reinterpreted. Therefore, we are unable to predict the future costs or impact of compliance. Additional proposals and proceedings that affect the oil and gas industry are regularly considered by Congress, the states, the FERC, and the courts. We cannot predict when or whether any such proposals may become effective. Environmental Matters Our operations are subject to stringent federal, state and local laws governing the discharge of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection. Numerous governmental departments such as the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issue regulations to implement and enforce such laws, which are often difficult and costly to comply with and which carry substantial civil and criminal penalties for failure to comply. These laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences, restrict the types, quantities and concentrations of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with drilling, production and transporting through pipelines, limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness, wetlands, frontier and other protected areas, require some form of remedial action to prevent pollution from former operations such as plugging abandoned wells, and impose substantial liabilities for pollution resulting from operations. In addition, these laws, rules and 6 Table of Contents regulations may restrict the rate of production. The regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases the cost of doing business, affecting growth and profitability. Changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently, and changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling, disposal or clean up requirements could adversely affect our operations and financial position, as well as the industry in general. We believe we are in substantial compliance with current applicable environmental laws and regulations. Although we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements, there is no assurance that this will continue. We did not have any material capital or other non recurring expenditures in connection with complying with environmental laws or environmental remediation matters in 2006, nor do we anticipate that such expenditures will be material in 2007. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA), known as the Superfund law, imposes liability, without regard to fault or the legality of the original conduct, on certain classes of persons who are considered to be responsible for the release of a hazardous substance into the environment. These persons include owners or operators of the disposal site or sites where the release occurred and companies that disposed of or arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the site where the release occurred. Under CERCLA, such persons may be subject to joint and several liability for the costs of cleaning up the hazardous substances that have been released into the environment, for damages to natural resources and for the costs of certain health studies. Furthermore, although petroleum, including crude oil and natural gas, is not a hazardous substance under CERCLA, at least two courts have ruled that certain wastes associated with the production of crude oil may be classified as hazardous substances under CERCLA and that such wastes may therefore give rise to liability under CERCLA. Beyond CERCLA, state laws regulate the disposal of oil and gas wastes, and periodically new state legislative initiatives are proposed that could have a significant impact on us. In addition, it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damages allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other pollutants into the environment pursuant to environmental statutes, common law or both. The Federal Water Pollution Control Act (FWPCA) imposes restrictions and strict controls regarding the discharge of produced waters and other oil and gas wastes into waters of the United States. Permits must be obtained to discharge pollutants into state and federal waters. The FWPCA and analogous state laws provide for civil, criminal and administrative penalties for any unauthorized discharges of oil and other hazardous substances in reportable quantities and may impose substantial potential liability for the costs of removal, remediation and damages. State water discharge regulations and Federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permits applicable to the oil and gas industry generally prohibit the discharge of produced water, sand and some other substances into coastal waters. The cost to comply with zero discharges mandated under federal and state law has not had a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Some oil and gas exploration and production facilities are required to obtain permits for their storm water discharges. Costs may be incurred in connection with treatment of wastewater or developing and implementing storm water pollution prevention plans. The Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) as amended, generally does not regulate most wastes generated by the exploration and production of oil and gas. RCRA specifically excludes from the definition of hazardous waste drilling fluids, produced waters, and other wastes associated with the exploration, development, or production of crude oil, natural gas or geothermal energy. However, these wastes may be regulated by the EPA or state agencies as non hazardous solid waste. Moreover, ordinary industrial wastes, such as paint wastes, waste solvents, laboratory wastes and waste compressor oils, can be regulated as hazardous wastes. Although the costs of managing wastes classified as hazardous waste may be significant, we do not expect to experience more burdensome costs than similarly situated companies. The Oil Pollution Act (OPA) requires owners and operators of facilities that could be the source of an oil spill into waters of the United States (a term defined to include rivers, creeks, wetlands and coastal waters) to adopt and implement plans and procedures to prevent any spill of oil into any waters of the United States. OPA also requires affected facility owners and operators to demonstrate that they have sufficient financial resources to pay for the costs of cleaning up an oil spill and compensating any parties damaged by an oil spill. Substantial civil and criminal fines and penalties can be imposed for violations of OPA and other environmental statutes. Stricter standards in environmental legislation may be imposed on the oil and gas industry in the future. For instance, legislation has been proposed in Congress from time to time that would alter the RCRA exemption by reclassifying certain oil and gas exploration and production wastes as hazardous wastes and make the waste subject to more stringent handling, disposal and clean up restrictions. If such legislation were enacted, it could have a significant impact on our operating costs, as well as the industry in general. Compliance with environmental requirements generally could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Although we have not experienced any material adverse effect from compliance with environmental requirements, no assurance may be given that this will continue. 7 Table of Contents ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS We are subject to various risks and uncertainties in the course of our business. The following summarizes some, but not all, of the risks and uncertainties which may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations. Volatility of oil and natural gas prices significantly affects our cash flow and capital resources and could hamper our ability to produce oil and gas economically Oil and natural gas prices are volatile, and a decline in prices would adversely affect our profitability and financial condition. The oil and natural gas industry is typically cyclical, and prices for oil and natural gas have been highly volatile. Historically, the industry has experienced severe downturns characterized by oversupply and or weak demand. Higher oil and natural gas prices have contributed to our positive earnings over the last several years. However, long term supply and demand for oil and natural gas is uncertain and subject to a myriad of factors such as: the domestic and foreign supply of oil and gas; the price and availability of alternative fuels; weather conditions; the level of consumer demand; the price of foreign imports; world wide economic conditions; political conditions in oil and gas producing regions; and domestic and foreign governmental regulations. Decreases in oil and natural gas prices from current levels could adversely affect our revenues, net income, cash flow and proved reserves. Significant price decreases could have a material adverse effect on our operations and limit our ability to fund capital expenditures. Without the ability to fund capital expenditures, we would be unable to replace reserves and production. Hedging transactions may limit our potential gains and involve other risks To manage our exposure to price risk, we, from time to time, enter into hedging arrangements, utilizing commodity derivatives with respect to a significant portion of our future production. The goal of these hedges is to lock in prices so as to limit volatility and increase the predictability of cash flow. These transactions limit our potential gains if oil and natural gas prices rise above the price established by the hedge. In addition, hedging transactions may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances, including instances in which: our production is less than expected; the counterparties to our futures contracts fail to perform under the contracts; or a sudden, unexpected event materially impacts oil or natural gas prices or the relationship between the hedged price index and the oil and gas sales price. In the fourth quarter of 2005, due to the trading volatility of NYMEX gas contracts, we experienced larger than usual differentials between actual prices paid at delivery points and NYMEX based gas hedges. Due to this event, certain of our gas hedges no longer qualify for hedge accounting and are marked to market. This may result in more volatility in our income in future periods. Information concerning our reserves and future net reserve estimates is uncertain There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved oil and natural gas reserves and their values, including many factors beyond our control. Estimates of proved reserves are by their nature uncertain. Although we believe these estimates are reasonable, actual production, revenues and costs to develop will likely vary from estimates, and these variances could be material. The accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data, engineering and geological interpretation and judgment, assumptions used regarding quantities of oil and natural gas in place, recovery rates and future 8 Table of Contents prices for oil and natural gas. Actual prices, production, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from those assumed in our estimates, and such variances may be material. Any variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves. If oil and natural gas prices decrease or exploration efforts are unsuccessful, we may be required to take write downs of our oil and natural gas properties In the past, we have been required to write down the carrying value of certain of our oil and natural gas properties, and there is a risk that we will be required to take additional write downs in the future. This could occur when oil and natural gas prices are low, or if we have downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves, increases in our estimates of operating or development costs, deterioration in our exploration results or mechanical problems with wells where the cost to redrill or repair does not justify the expense which might occur due to hurricanes. Accounting rules require that the carrying value of oil and natural gas properties be periodically reviewed for possible impairment. Impairment is recognized when the book value of a proven property is greater than the expected undiscounted future net cash flows from that property and on acreage when conditions indicate the carrying value is not recoverable. We may be required to write down the carrying value of a property based on oil and natural gas prices at the time of the impairment review, as well as a continuing evaluation of drilling results, production data, economics and other factors. While an impairment charge reflects our long term ability to recover an investment, it does not impact cash or cash flow from operating activities, but it does reduce our reported earnings and increases our leverage ratios. For example, based primarily on the poor performance of certain properties acquired in 1997 and 1998 and significantly lower oil and natural gas prices, we recorded impairments of $215.0 million in 1998 and $29.9 million in 1999. At year end 2001, we recorded an impairment of $31.1 million due to lower year end prices. At year end 2004, we recorded an impairment of $3.6 million on an offshore property due to hurricane damage and related production declines. In the third quarter of 2006, we recorded a $2.4 million impairment on an offshore property due to declining oil and gas prices. Our business is subject to operating hazards and environmental regulations that could result in substantial losses or liabilities Oil and natural gas operations are subject to many risks, including well blowouts, craterings, explosions, uncontrollable flows of oil, natural gas or well fluids, fires, formations with abnormal pressures, pipeline ruptures or spills, pollution, releases of toxic natural gas and other environmental hazards and risks. If any of these hazards occur, we could sustain substantial losses as a result of: injury or loss of life; severe damage to or destruction of property, natural resources and equipment; pollution or other environmental damage; clean up responsibilities; regulatory investigations and penalties; or suspension of operations. As we drill to deeper horizons and in more geologically complex areas, we could experience a greater increase in operating and financial risks due to inherent higher reservoir pressures and unknown downhole risk exposures. As we continue to drill deeper, the number of rigs capable of drilling to such depths will be fewer and we may experience greater competition from other operators. Our operations are subject to numerous and increasingly strict federal, state and local laws, regulations and enforcement policies relating to the environment. We may incur significant costs and liabilities in complying with existing or future environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies and may incur costs arising out of property damage or injuries to employees and other persons. These costs may result from our current and former operations and even may be caused by previous owners of property we own or lease. Any past, present or future failure by us to completely comply with environmental laws, regulations and enforcement policies could cause us to incur substantial fines, sanctions or liabilities from cleanup costs or other damages. Incurrence of those costs or damages could reduce or eliminate funds available for exploration, development or acquisitions or cause us to incur losses. 9 Table of Contents We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these potential risks and losses. We may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented. Recently, we have experienced substantial increases in premiums especially in areas affected by the hurricanes and tropical storms. Insurers have imposed revised limits affecting how much the insurers will pay on actual storm claims plus the cost to re drill wells where substantial damage has been incurred. Insurers are also requiring us to retain larger deductibles and reducing the scope of what insurable losses will include. Even with the increase in future insurance premiums, coverage will be reduced, requiring us to bear a greater potential risk if our oil and gas properties are damaged. We do not maintain any business interruption insurance. In addition, pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable. If a significant accident or other event occurs that is not fully covered by insurance, it could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to financing and interest rate exposure risks Our business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability, terms of and cost of capital, increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating. These changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase, limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities and place us at a competitive disadvantage. For example at December 31, 2006, approximately 57% of our debt is at fixed interest rates with the remaining 43% subject to variable interest rates. Many of our current and potential competitors have greater resources than we have and we may not be able to successfully compete in acquiring, exploring and developing new properties We face competition in every aspect of our business, including, but not limited to, acquiring reserves and leases, obtaining goods, services and employees needed to operate and manage our business and marketing oil and natural gas. Competitors include multinational oil companies, independent production companies and individual producers and operators. Many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do. The demand for field services and their ability to meet that demand may limit our ability to drill and produce our oil and natural gas properties Due to current industry demands, well service providers and related equipment and personnel are in short supply. This is causing escalating prices, the possibility of poor services coupled with potential damage to downhole reservoirs and personnel injuries. Such pressures will likely increase the actual cost of services, extend the time to secure such services and add costs for damages due to accidents sustained from the over use of equipment and inexperienced personnel. The oil and natural gas industry is subject to extensive regulation The oil and natural gas industry is subject to various types of regulations in the United States by local, state and federal agencies. Legislation affecting the industry is under constant review for amendment or expansion, frequently increasing our regulatory burden. Numerous departments and agencies, both state and federal, are authorized by statute to issue rules and regulations binding on participants in the oil and natural gas industry. Compliance with such rules and regulations often increases our cost of doing business and, in turn, decreases our profitability. Acquisitions are subject to the risks and uncertainties of evaluating reserves and potential liabilities and may be disruptive and difficult to integrate into our business We could be subject to significant liabilities related to our acquisitions. It generally is not feasible to review in detail every individual property included in an acquisition. Ordinarily, a review is focused on higher valued properties. However, even a detailed review of all properties and records may not reveal existing or potential problems in all of the properties, nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to assess fully their deficiencies and capabilities. We do not always inspect every well we acquire, and environmental problems, such as groundwater contamination, are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is performed. For example, in 1997, we consummated a large acquisition that proved extremely disappointing. Production from the acquired properties fell more rapidly than anticipated and further development results were below the results we had originally projected. The poor production performance of these properties resulted in material downward reserve revisions. There is no assurance that our recent and or future acquisition activity will not result in similarly disappointing results. In addition, there is intense competition for acquisition opportunities in our industry. Competition for acquisitions may increase the cost of, or cause us to refrain from, completing acquisitions. Our acquisition strategy is dependent upon, among other things, our ability to obtain debt and equity financing and, in some cases, regulatory approvals. Our ability to 10 Table of Contents pursue our acquisition strategy may be hindered if we are not able to obtain financing on terms acceptable to us or regulatory approvals. Acquisitions often pose integration risks and difficulties. In connection with recent and future acquisitions, the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant management attention and financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations. Future acquisitions could result in our incurring additional debt, contingent liabilities, expenses and diversion of resources, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results. Our success depends on key members of our management and our ability to attract and retain experienced technical and other professional personnel Our success is highly dependent on our management personnel, none of which is currently subject to an employment contract. The loss of one or more of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on our business. Furthermore, competition for experienced technical and other professional personnel is intense. If we cannot retain our current personnel or attract additional experienced personnel, our ability to compete could be adversely affected. Our future success depends on our ability to replace reserves that we produce Because the rate of production from oil and natural gas properties generally declines as reserves are depleted, our future success depends upon our ability to economically find or acquire and produce additional oil and natural gas reserves. Except to the extent that we acquire additional properties containing proved reserves, conduct successful exploration and development activities or, through engineering studies, identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves, our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced. Future oil and natural gas production, therefore, is highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves that are economically recoverable. We cannot assure you that we will be able to find or acquire and develop additional reserves at an acceptable cost. A portion of our business is subject to special risks generally related to offshore operations and specifically in the Gulf of Mexico Offshore operations are subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment, such as capsizing, collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions. These conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production. As a result, we could incur substantial expense and liabilities that could materially reduce the funds available for exploration, development or leasehold acquisitions or result in the loss of equipment and properties. As of February 20, 2007, we continued to have approximately 1.0 Mmcfe per day of production shut in due to the effects of hurricanes Katrina and Rita. Production of reserves from reservoirs in the Gulf of Mexico generally declines more rapidly than from reservoirs in many other producing regions. This results in recovery of a relatively higher percentage of reserves from properties in the Gulf of Mexico during the initial few years of production. As a result, reserve replacement needs from new prospects are greater and require us to incur significant capital expenditures to replace production. New technologies may cause our current exploration and drilling methods to become obsolete The oil and natural gas industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology, including the introduction of new products and services using new technologies. As competitors use or develop new technologies, we may be placed at a competitive disadvantage, and competitive pressures may force us to implement new technologies at a substantial cost. In addition, competitors may have greater financial, technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before we can. One or more of the technologies that we currently use or that we may implement in the future may become obsolete. We cannot be certain that we will be able to implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to us. If we are not able to maintain technological advancements consistent with industry standards, our operations and financial condition may be adversely affected. 11 Table of Contents Our business depends on oil and natural gas transportation facilities, most of which are owned by others The marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part on the availability, proximity and capacity of pipeline systems owned by third parties. The unavailability of or lack of available capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut in of producing wells or the delay or discontinuance of development plans for properties. Although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our product, material changes in these business relationships could materially affect our operations. We generally do not purchase firm transportation on third party facilities and therefore, our production transportation can be interrupted by those having firm arrangements. Federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation, tax and energy policies, changes in supply and demand, pipeline pressures, damage to or destruction of pipelines and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce, gather and transport oil and natural gas. The disruption of third party facilities due to maintenance and or weather could negatively impact our ability to market and deliver our products. We have no control over when or if such facilities are restored or what prices will be charged. A total shut in of production could materially affect us due to a lack of cash flow, and if a substantial portion of the production is hedged at lower than market prices, those financial hedges would have to be paid from borrowings absent sufficient cash flow. Our indebtedness could limit our ability to successfully operate our business We are leveraged and our exploration and development program will require substantial capital resources estimated to range from $650.0 million to $825.0 million per year over the next three years, depending on the level of drilling and the expected cost of services. Our existing operations will also require ongoing capital expenditures. In addition, if we decide to pursue additional acquisitions, our capital expenditures will increase both to complete such acquisitions and to explore and develop any newly acquired properties. The degree to which we are leveraged could have other important consequences, including the following: we may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to the payment of our indebtedness, reducing the funds available for our operations; a portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, making us vulnerable to increases in interest rates; we may be more highly leveraged than some of our competitors, which could place us at a competitive disadvantage; our degree of leverage may make us more vulnerable to a downturn in our business or the general economy; the terms of our existing credit arrangements contain numerous financial and other restrictive covenants; our debt level could limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and we may have difficulties borrowing money in the future. Despite our current levels of indebtedness we still may be able to incur substantially more debt. This could further increase the risks described above. Any failure to meet our debt obligations could harm our business, financial condition and results of operations If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt obligations, we may be forced to sell assets, seek additional equity or restructure our debt. In addition, any failure to make scheduled payments of interest and principal on our outstanding indebtedness would likely result in a reduction of our credit rating, which could harm our ability to incur additional indebtedness on acceptable terms. Our cash flow and capital resources may be insufficient for payment of interest on and principal of our debt in the future and any such alternative measures may be unsuccessful or may not permit us to meet scheduled debt service obligations, which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity. We exist in a litigious environment Any constituent could bring suit or allege a violation of an existing contract. This action could delay when operations can actually commence or could cause a halt to production until such alleged violations are resolved by the courts. Not only could we incur significant legal and support expenses in defending our rights, planned operations could be delayed which would impact our future operations and financial condition. Such legal disputes could also distract management and other personnel from their primary responsibilities. 12 Table of Contents Common stockholders will be diluted if additional shares are issued Since 1998, we have exchanged 31.9 million shares of common stock for debt and convertible securities. The exchanges were made based on the relative market value of the common stock and the debt and convertible securities at the time of the exchange. Also in 2004 and 2005, we sold 33.8 million shares of common stock to finance acquisitions. In 2006, we issued 6.5 million shares as part of the Stroud acquisition. While the exchanges have reduced interest expense, preferred dividends and future repayment obligations, the larger number of common shares outstanding had a dilutive effect on our existing stockholders. Our ability to repurchase securities for cash is limited by our bank credit facility and our senior subordinated note agreements. In addition, we may issue additional shares of common stock, additional subordinated notes or other securities or debt convertible into common stock, to extend maturities or fund capital expenditures, including acquisitions. If we issue additional shares of our common stock in the future, it may have a dilutive effect on our current outstanding stockholders. Dividend limitations Limits on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments, as defined, are imposed under our bank credit facility and under our senior subordinated note agreements. These limitations may, in certain circumstances, limit or prevent the payment of dividends independent of our dividend policy. Our financial statements are complex Due to accounting rules, our financial statements continue to be complex, particularly with reference to hedging, asset retirement obligations, equity awards, deferred taxes and the accounting for our deferred compensation plan. We expect such complexity to continue and possibly increase. Our stock price may be volatile and you may not be able to resell shares of our common stock at or above the price you paid The price of our common stock fluctuates significantly, which may result in losses for investors. The market price of our common stock has been volatile. From January 1, 2004 to December 31, 2006, the last daily sale price of our common stock reported by the New York Stock Exchange ranged from a low of $6.25 per share to a high of $31.77 per share. We expect our stock to continue to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors, including factors beyond our control. These include: changes in oil and natural gas prices; variations in quarterly drilling, recompletions, acquisitions and operating results; changes in financial estimates by securities analysts; changes in market valuations of comparable companies; additions or departures of key personnel; or future sales of our stock. We may fail to meet expectations of our stockholders or of securities analysts at some time in the future, and our stock price could decline as a result. 13 Table of Contents ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS As of the date of this filing, we have no unresolved comments from the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission. ITEM 2. PROPERTIES The table below summarizes certain data for our core operating areas for the year ended December 31, 2006: Average Daily Total Percentage Production Total Percentage Proved of Total (mcfe Production of Total Reserves Proved Division per day) (mcfe) Production (Mmcfe) Reserves Southwest 150,731 55,017,031 55 % 774,933 44 % Appalachia 103,032 37,606,463 37 % 915,054 52 % Gulf Coast 22,334 8,151,801 8 % 68,239 4 % 276,097 100,775,295 100 % 1,758,226 100 % Segment reporting is not applicable to us as we have a single company wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments. We track only basic operational data by area. We do not maintain complete separate financial statement information by area. We measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an area by area basis. Southwest Division The Southwest Division conducts drilling, production and field operations in the Barnett Shale of North Central Texas, the Permian Basin of West Texas and eastern New Mexico and the East Texas Basin as well as in the Texas Panhandle and the Anadarko Basin of western Oklahoma. In the Southwest Division, we own 2,057 net producing wells, 96% of which we operate. Our average working interest is 73%. We have approximately 687,000 gross (480,000 net) acres under lease. Total proved reserves increased 272.3 Bcfe, or 54%, at December 31, 2006 when compared to year end 2005. Production was more than offset by property purchases (122.9 Bcfe) and drilling additions (208.2 Bcfe). Annual production increased 29% over 2005. During 2006, the region spent $313.1 million to drill 253.0 (212.0 net) development wells, of which 249.0 (210.2 net) were productive and 4 (1.2 net) exploratory wells, of which 2 (0.2 net) were productive. During the year, the region achieved a 99% drilling success rate. At December 31, 2006, the Southwest Division had a development inventory of 219 proven drilling locations and 316 proven recompletions. Development projects include recompletions, infill drilling and to a lesser extent, installation of secondary recovery projects. These activities also include increasing reserves and production through aggressive cost control, upgrading lifting equipment, improving gathering systems and surface facilities and performing restimulations and refracturing operations. Appalachia Division Our properties in this division are located in the Appalachian Basin in the northeastern United States principally in Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York, West Virginia and Virginia. The reserves principally produce from the Pennsylvanian (coalbed formation), Upper Devonian, Medina, Clinton, Queenston, Big Lime, Marcellus Shale, Niagaran Reef, Knox, Huntersville Chert, Oriskany and Trenton Black River formations at depths ranging from 2,500 to 12,500 feet. Generally, after initial flush production, most of these properties are characterized by gradual decline rates, typically producing for 10 to 35 years. We own 9,306 net producing wells, 69% of which we operate and 4,900 miles of gas gathering lines. Our average working interest is 73%. We have approximately 2.3 million gross (1.9 million net) acres under lease which includes over 70,000 acres associated with royalties. Reserves at December 31, 2006 increased 76.7 Bcfe, or 9%, from 2005 due to drilling additions (161.8 Bcfe) which were partially offset by a net unfavorable reserve revision and production. Annual production increased 10% over 2005. During 2006, the region spent $184.3 million to drill 739 (477.8 net) development wells, of which 737 (477.0 net) were 14 Table of Contents productive and 10 (7.0 net) exploratory wells, of which 9 (6.0 net) were productive. During the year, the region achieved approximately a 100% drilling success rate. At December 31, 2006, the Appalachia Division had an inventory of 3,300 proven drilling locations and 212 proven recompletions. Gulf Coast Division The Gulf Coast properties are located onshore in Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi and in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico. The divisions wells are characterized by high initial rates and relatively short reserve lives. Over the past several years, we have shifted our focus away from offshore to onshore Gulf of Mexico properties that provide greater operating control, generally lower costs and higher repeatability. Major onshore fields produce from Hartburg formations at depths of 10,000 to 11,000 feet in the Upper Texas Gulf Coast, the Upper Oligocene in South Louisiana at depths of 10,000 to 12,000 feet and the Sligo and Hosston formations at depths of 15,000 to 16,500 feet in the Oakvale field in Mississippi. We operate a majority of our onshore properties while third parties operate all of our offshore properties. Onshore, we have approximately 102,000 gross (56,000 net) acres under lease. Offshore properties include interests in 37 platforms in water depths ranging from 11 to 240 feet. We own 33 net producing wells in this division, 42% of which we operate. Our average working interest is 23%. Our Gulf Coast Division owns a license to a 3 D seismic database covering over 800 contiguous blocks in the shallow water of the Gulf of Mexico, primarily offshore Louisiana. Reserves increased 2.4 Bcfe, or 4%, from 2005 with production more than offset by drilling additions (9.5 Bcfe) and a favorable reserve revision. On an annual basis, production decreased 23% from 2005. During 2006, the region spent $38.0 million to drill 8 (4.6 net) development wells, of which 6 (2.6 net) were productive and 3 (1.3 net) exploratory wells, of which 1 (0.7 net) was productive. During the year, the division had a 56% drilling success rate. At December 31, 2006, the Gulf Coast Division had an inventory of 13 proven drilling locations and 59 proven recompletions. Proved Reserves The following table sets forth our estimated proved reserves at the end of each of the past five years: December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Natural gas (Mmcf) Developed 875,395 724,876 580,006 344,187 320,224 Undeveloped 560,583 400,534 366,422 142,217 120,043 Total 1,435,978 1,125,410 946,428 486,404 440,267 Oil and NGLs (Mbbls) Developed 37,750 33,029 27,715 24,912 17,176 Undeveloped 15,957 13,863 10,451 8,111 5,776 Total 53,707 46,892 38,166 33,023 22,952 Total (Mmcfe) (a) 1,758,226 1,406,762 1,175,425 684,541 577,977 % Developed 63 % 66 % 64 % 72 % 73 % (a) Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcfe. Our percentage of proved developed reserves declined from 2003 to 2004 due to the proved undeveloped reserves acquired in the Great Lakes and Pine Mountain acquisitions (see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements), adding to our future drilling inventory. From 2004 to 2005, our proved undeveloped percentage declined from 36% to 34% as we continued to aggressively drill. The Stroud acquisition in June of 2006 was primarily responsible for the decrease in the proved developed reserve percentage in 2006. The Stroud acquisition significantly increased our Barnett Shale drilling and prospect inventory. 15 Table of Contents The following table sets forth summary information by division with respect to estimated proved reserves at December 31, 2006: Pre tax Present Value (a) Reserve Volumes Amount Oil NGL Natural Gas Total (In thousands) % (Mbbls) (Mmcf) (Mmcfe) % Southwest $ 1,407,302 51 % 39,859 535,770 774,933 44 % Appalachia 1,181,045 43 % 12,183 841,958 915,054 52 % Gulf Coast 183,095 6 % 1,665 58,250 68,239 4 % Total $ 2,771,442 100 % 53,707 1,435,978 1,758,226 100 % (a) This measure was prepared using year end oil and gas prices adjusted for the location and quality of reserves, discounted at 10% per year. Our pre tax present value of $2.8 billion less discounted taxes of $0.8 billion equals our standardized measure of $2.0 billion. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements. At year end 2006, the following independent petroleum consultants reviewed our reserves: DeGolyer and MacNaughton (Southwest and Gulf Coast), H.J. Gruy and Associates, Inc. (Southwest), and Wright and Company, Inc. (Appalachia). These engineers were selected for their geographic expertise and their history in engineering certain properties. At December 31, 2006, these consultants collectively reviewed approximately 87% of our proved reserves. All estimates of oil and gas reserves are subject to uncertainty. Historical variances between our reserve estimates and the aggregate estimates of our consultants have been less than 5%. The following table sets forth the estimated future net revenues, excluding open hedging contracts, from proved reserves, the present value of those net revenues and the expected benchmark prices and average field prices used in projecting them over the past five years (in millions except prices): December 31, 2006 2005 2004 2003 2002 Future net revenue $ 6,391 $ 10,429 $ 5,035 $ 2,687 $ 1,817 Present value Pre tax 2,771 4,887 2,396 1,396 965 After tax 2,002 3,384 1,749 1,003 500 Benchmark prices Oil price (per barrel) $ 61.05 $ 61.04 $ 43.33 $ 32.52 $ 31.17 Gas price (per mcf) $ 5.64 $ 10.08 $ 6.18 $ 6.19 $ 4.75 Wellhead prices Oil price (per barrel) $ 57.66 $ 57.80 $ 40.44 $ 29.48 $ 27.52 Gas price (per mcf) $ 5.24 $ 9.83 $ 6.05 $ 6.03 $ 4.76 Future net revenues represent projected revenues from the sale of proved reserves net of production and development costs (including operating expenses and production taxes). Such calculations, prepared in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 69, Disclosures about Oil and Gas Producing Activities, are based on costs and prices in effect at December 31 of each year. There can be no assurance that the proved reserves will be produced within the periods indicated and prices and costs will not remain constant. There are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating reserves and related information and different reservoir engineers often arrive at different estimates for the same properties. No estimates of our reserves have been filed with or included in reports to another federal authority or agency since year end. 16 Table of Contents Producing Wells The following table sets forth information relating to productive wells at December 31, 2006. We also own royalty interests in an additional 1,991 wells where we do not own a working interest. If we own both a royalty and a working interest in a well such interests are included in the table below. Wells are classified as crude oil or natural gas according to their predominant production stream. Average Total Wells Working Gross Net Interest Crude oil 2,381 2,038 86 % Natural gas 13,330 9,358 70 % Total 15,711 11,396 73 % The day to day operations of oil and gas properties are the responsibility of the operator designated under pooling or operating agreements. The operator supervises production, maintains production records, employs or contracts for field personnel and performs other functions. An operator receives reimbursement for direct expenses incurred in the performance of its duties as well as monthly per well producing and drilling overhead reimbursement at rates customarily charged by unaffiliated third parties. The charges customarily vary with the depth and location of the well being operated. Acreage At December 31, 2006, we owned interests in developed and undeveloped oil and gas acreage as set forth in the table below. These ownership interests generally take the form of working interests in oil and gas leases or licenses that have varying terms. Developed acreage includes leased acreage that is allocated or assignable to producing wells or wells capable of production even though shallower or deeper horizons may not have been fully explored. Undeveloped acreage includes leased acres on which wells have not been drilled or completed to a point that would permit the production of commercial quantities of natural gas or oil, regardless of whether or not the acreage contains proved reserves. The following table sets forth certain information regarding our developed and undeveloped acreage held at December 31, 2006: Acres Average Working Gross Net Interest Developed 1,458,500 1,139,185 78 % Undeveloped 1,756,406 1,360,545 77 % Total (a) 3,214,906 2,499,730 78 % (a) Includes over 70,000 acres in Appalachia in which we own royalty and overriding royalty interests. Also, does not include 24,000 net acres in the Southwest Division attributable to a farm in. Undeveloped Acreage Expirations The table below summarizes by year our undeveloped acreage scheduled to expire in the next five years. Acres % of Total As of December 31, Gross Net Undeveloped 2007 223,980 179,351 14 % 2008 227,172 164,179 13 % 2009 280,443 204,338 16 % 2010 107,479 88,798 7 % 2011 277,866 217,487 17 % 17 Table of Contents Drilling Results The following table summarizes drilling activity for the past three years. Gross wells reflect the sum of all wells in which we own an interest. Net wells reflect the sum of our working interests in gross wells. 2006 2005 2004 Gross Net Gross Net Gross Net Development wells Productive 992.0 689.7 813.0 573.8 436.0 368.5 Dry 8.0 4.6 10.0 7.7 16.0 12.0 Exploratory wells Productive 12.0 6.9 13.0 8.1 14.0 9.2 Dry 5.0 2.6 5.0 3.9 10.0 6.9 Total wells Productive 1,004.0 696.6 826.0 581.9 450.0 377.7 Dry 13.0 7.2 15.0 11.6 26.0 18.9 Total 1,017.0 703.8 841.0 593.5 476.0 396.6 Success ratio 99 % 99 % 98 % 98 % 95 % 95 % Real Property We lease approximately 203,700 square feet of office space, primarily in Texas and Oklahoma under standard office lease arrangements that expire at various dates through 2017. Our Appalachian Division owns a 34,500 square foot office building and various other field offices. In the first half of 2007, our Fort Worth office will be relocating to 100 Throckmorton Street, Suite 1200, Fort Worth, Texas 76102. We believe our facilities are adequate to meet our current needs and existing space could be expanded or additional space could be leased if required. We own various vehicles and other equipment that is used in field operations. We believe such equipment is in good repair and can be readily replaced if necessary. Title to Properties We believe that we have satisfactory title to all of our producing properties in accordance with generally accepted industry standards. As is customary in the industry, in the case of undeveloped properties, often minimal investigation of record title is made at the time of lease acquisition. Investigations are made prior to the consummation of an acquisition of producing properties and before commencement of drilling operations on undeveloped properties. Individual properties may be subject to burdens that we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect the value of the properties. Burdens on properties may include: customary royalty interests; liens incident to operating agreements and for current taxes; obligations or duties under applicable laws; development obligations under oil and gas leases; or burdens such as net profit interests. ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS We have been named as a defendant in a number of legal actions arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, such litigation and claims are likely to be resolved without a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity, although an unfavorable outcome could have a material adverse effect on the operations of a given interim period or year. See also Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements. ITEM 4.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with Item 6, Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Statements in our discussion may be forward looking. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that a number of factors could cause future production, revenues and expenses to differ materially from our expectations. See Disclosures Regarding Forward Looking Statements at the beginning of this Annual Report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. for additional discussion of some of these factors and risks. Overview of Our Business We are an independent natural gas and oil company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, primarily in the Southwestern, Appalachian and Gulf Coast regions of the United States. We operate in one segment. We have a single company wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments. We track only basic operational data by area. We do not maintain complete separate financial statement information by area. We measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an area by area basis. Our strategy is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects coupled with complementary acquisitions. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Industry Environment We operate entirely within the United States, a mature region for the exploration and production of oil and gas. As a mature region, while new discoveries of oil and gas occur in the United States, the size and frequency of these discoveries is declining, while finding and development costs are increasing. We believe that there remain areas of the United States, such as the Appalachian basin and certain areas in our Southwest and Gulf Coast Divisions, which are underexplored or have not been fully explored and developed with the benefit of newly available exploration, production and reserve enhancement technology. Examples of such technology include advanced 3 D seismic processing, hydraulic reservoir fracture stimulation, advances in well logging and analysis, horizontal drilling and completion techniques, secondary and tertiary recovery practices, and automated remote well monitoring and control devices. Another characteristic of a mature region is the historical exit of larger independent producers and major oil companies from such regions. These companies, searching for ever larger new discoveries, have ventured increasingly overseas and offshore, de emphasizing their onshore United States assets. This movement out of mature basins by larger companies has provided acquisition opportunities for companies like ours that maintain well equipped technical teams capable of generating additional value from these assets. In other situations, to increase cash flow without increasing capital spending, larger independent producers and major integrated oil companies have allowed smaller companies the opportunity to explore and develop reserves on their undeveloped acreage through joint ventures and farm in arrangements. We believe the acquisition market for natural gas properties has become extremely competitive as producers vie for additional production and expanded drilling opportunities. Acquisition values have reached historic highs and we expect these values to remain high in 2007. In addition, we expect drilling and service costs to remain at a high level in 2007 and for lease operating expenses to continue to rise as producers are forced to make operational enhancements to maintain aging fields. Natural gas is a commodity. The price that we receive for the natural gas we produce is largely a function of market supply and demand. Demand for natural gas in the United States has increased dramatically over the last ten years. Demand is impacted by general economic conditions, estimates of gas in storage, weather and other seasonal condition, including hurricanes and tropical storms. Market conditions involving over or under supply of natural gas can result in substantial price volatility. Historically, commodity prices have been volatile and we expect the volatility to continue in the future. A substantial or extended decline in oil and gas prices or poor drilling results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, quantities of oil and gas reserves that may be economically produced and our ability to access capital markets. 22 Table of Contents Source of Our Revenues We derive our revenues from the sale of natural gas and oil that is produced from our properties. Revenues are a function of the volume produced and the prevailing market price at the time of sale. The price of oil and natural gas is the primary factor affecting our revenues. To achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to downward price fluctuations, we utilize derivative instruments to hedge future sales prices on a significant portion of our natural gas and oil production. During 2006, 2005 and 2004 the use of derivative instruments prevented us from realizing the full benefit of upward price movements and may continue to do so in future periods. Principal Components of Our Cost Structure Direct Operating Expenses. These are day to day costs incurred to bring hydrocarbons out of the ground and to the market together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties. Such costs also include workovers and repairs to our oil and gas properties not covered by insurance. These costs are expected to remain high in 2007 as the demand for these services continues to increase. Direct operating expense includes stock based compensation expense (non cash) associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), amortization of restricted stock grants and mark to market of SARs as part of employee compensation. Production and Ad Valorem Taxes. These costs are primarily paid based on a percentage of market prices and not on hedged prices of production or at fixed rates established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. Exploration Expense. Geological and geophysical costs, seismic costs, delay rentals and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells or dry holes. Exploration expense includes stock based compensation expense (non cash) associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), amortization of restricted stock grants and mark to market of SARs as part of employee compensation. General and Administrative Expense. Overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our production and development operations, audit and other professional fees and legal compliance are included in general and administrative expense. General and administrative expense includes stock based compensation expense (non cash) associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), amortization of restricted stock grants and mark to market of SARs as part of employee compensation. Interest. We typically finance a portion of our working capital requirements and acquisitions with borrowings under our bank credit facility and with our longer term public traded debt securities. As a result, we incur substantial interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. We may continue to incur significant interest expense as we continue to grow. We expect our 2007 capital budget to be funded with internal cash flow and asset sales. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. The systematic expensing of the capital costs incurred to acquire, explore and develop natural gas and oil. As a successful efforts company, we capitalize all costs associated with our acquisition and development efforts and all successful exploration efforts, and apportion these costs to each unit of production through depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. This also includes the systematic, monthly accretion of the future abandonment costs of tangible assets such as platforms, wells, service assets, pipelines, and other facilities. Income Taxes. We are subject to state and federal income taxes but are currently not in a tax paying position for regular federal income taxes, primarily due to the current deductibility of intangible drilling costs (IDC). We do pay some state income taxes where our IDC deductions do not exceed our taxable income or where state income taxes are determined on another basis. Currently, all of our federal taxes are deferred; however, at some point, we will utilize all of our net operating loss carryforwards and we will recognize current income tax expense and continue to recognize current tax expense as long as we are generating taxable income. 23 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Income and Operations Volumes and Price Data 2006 2005 2004 Production: Crude oil (bbls) 3,159,623 3,031,468 2,512,434 NGLs (bbls) 1,091,785 1,011,692 988,192 Natural gas (mcf) 75,266,847 63,003,600 50,722,121 Total (mcfe) (a) 100,775,295 87,262,560 71,725,877 Average daily production: Crude oil (bbls) 8,656 8,305 6,865 NGLs (bbls) 2,991 2,772 2,700 Natural gas (mcf) 206,210 172,613 138,585 Total (mcfe) (a) 276,097 239,076 195,972 Average sales prices (excluding hedging): Crude oil (per bbl) $ 62.60 $ 53.31 $ 39.25 NGLs (per bbl) 33.62 31.52 23.73 Natural gas (per mcf) 6.58 7.98 5.79 Total (per mcfe) (a) 7.25 7.98 5.80 Average sales prices (including hedging): Crude oil (per bbl) $ 47.27 $ 38.71 $ 28.04 NGLs (per bbl) 33.62 27.27 19.76 Natural gas (per mcf) 6.61 6.03 4.45 Total (per mcfe) (a) 6.79 6.02 4.40 Average NYMEX prices (b) Oil (per bbl) $ 66.22 $ 56.56 $ 41.42 Natural gas (per mcf) 7.26 8.55 6.09 (a) Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcfe.

Our 2006 performance reflects another year of successfully executing our strategy of growth through drilling and complementary acquisitions. The business of exploring for, developing, and acquiring oil and gas is highly competitive and capital intensive. As in any commodity business, the costs associated with finding, acquiring, extracting, and financing the operation are critical to profitability and long term value creation for stockholders. Generating meaningful growth while containing costs represents an ongoing challenge for management. During periods of historically high oil and gas prices, such as 2005 and 2006, drilling service and operating cost increases are more prevalent due to increased competition for goods and services. We faced other challenges in 2006 including attracting and retaining qualified personnel, consummating and integrating acquisitions, and accessing the capital markets to fund our growth and capital simplification process on sufficiently favorable terms. We have continued to expand and improve the technical staff through the hiring of additional experienced professionals. Our inventory of exploration and development prospects continues to build, providing new growth opportunities, greater diversification of technical risk and better efficiency. Total revenues increased 46% in 2006 over the same period of 2005. This increase is due to higher production and realized oil and gas prices. Our 2006 production growth is due to acquisitions completed in 2006 and to the continued success of our drilling program. Realized prices were higher by 13% in 2006 reflecting the expiration of lower priced oil and gas hedges. As discussed in Item 1A of this report, significant changes in oil and gas prices can have a significant impact on our balance sheet and our results of operations, particularly on the fair value of our derivatives. Comparison of 2006 to 2005 Oil and gas revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (in thousands) is summarized in the following table: 2006 2005 Change % Revenues: Oil wellhead $ 197,815 $ 161,627 $ 36,188 22 % Oil hedges (48,445 ) (44,273 ) (4,172 ) 9 % Total oil revenue $ 149,370 $ 117,354 $ 32,016 27 % Gas wellhead $ 495,920 $ 502,691 $ (6,771 ) 1 % Gas hedges 1,934 (122,560 ) 124,494 102 % Total gas revenue $ 497,854 $ 380,131 $ 117,723 31 % NGL $ 36,704 $ 31,891 $ 4,813 15 % NGL hedges (4,302 ) 4,302 100 % Total NGL revenue $ 36,704 $ 27,589 $ 9,115 33 % Combined wellhead $ 730,439 $ 696,209 $ 34,230 5 % Combined hedges (46,511 ) (171,135 ) 124,624 73 % Total oil and gas revenue $ 683,928 $ 525,074 $ 158,854 30 % 25 Table of Contents Average realized price received for oil and gas during 2006 was $6.79 per mcfe, up 13% or $0.77 per mcfe from 2005. Oil and gas revenues for 2006 reached a record $683.9 million and were 30% higher than 2005 due to higher realized oil and gas prices and a 15% increase in production. The average price received increased 22% to $47.27 per barrel for oil and increased 10% to $6.61 per mcf for gas from 2005. The effect of our hedging program decreased realized prices $0.46 per mcfe in 2006 versus a decrease of $1.96 in 2005. Production volumes increased 15% from 2005 due to continued drilling success and additions from acquisitions consummated in 2006. Production increased 13.5 Bcfe from 2005. Our production volumes increased 10% in our Appalachia Division, increased 29% in our Southwest Division and declined 22% in our Gulf Coast Division. Mark to market on oil and gas derivatives includes a gain of $86.5 million in 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2005, certain of our gas hedges no longer qualified for hedge accounting due to the effect of gas price volatility on the correlation between realized prices and hedge reference prices. Other revenue increased in 2006 to a gain of $6.8 million from a loss of $2.6 million in 2005. The 2006 period includes $6.0 million of ineffective hedging gains and income from equity method investments of $548,000. The 2005 period includes ineffective hedging losses of $3.4 million. Our operating expenses have increased as we continue to grow. We believe most of our operating expense fluctuations should be analyzed on a unit of production, or per mcfe basis. The following table presents information about our operating expenses on an mcfe basis for 2006 and 2005: Operating expenses per mcfe 2006 2005 Change % Direct operating expense (excluding $0.01 per mcfe stock based compensation in 2006) $ 0.90 $ 0.76 $ 0.14 18 % Production and ad valorem tax expense 0.37 0.36 0.01 3 % General and administrative expense (excluding stock based compensation of $0.14 per mcfe in 2006 and $0.06 per mcfe in 2005) 0.35 0.33 0.02 6 % Interest expense 0.57 0.44 0.13 30 % Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense (excluding impairment) 1.66 1.46 0.20 14 % Direct operating expense (excluding stock based compensation) increased $24.2 million to $90.8 million due to higher oilfield service costs, higher volumes and the integration of our recent acquisitions. Our operating expenses are increasing as we add new wells and maintain production from our existing properties. We incurred $6.7 million of expenses associated with workovers in 2006 versus $7.4 million in 2005. In 2006, 54% of our workover expenses were incurred by our Gulf Coast division and were primarily hurricane related. In 2005, 58% of our workover expenses were incurred by our Gulf Coast Division and were primarily hurricane related. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expenses (excluding stock based compensation) were $0.90 per mcfe and increased $0.14 per mcfe from 2005 with the increase consisting primarily of higher offshore well insurance ($0.02 per mcfe), higher utilities ($0.02 per mcfe), and higher water disposal and equipment costs ($0.06 per mcfe). Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices and not hedged prices. These taxes increased $5.4 million, or 17%, from the same period of the prior year. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes increased from $0.36 per mcfe in 2005 to $0.37 per mcfe in 2006 due to higher market prices. General and administrative expense (excluding stock based compensation) for 2006 increased 25%, or $7.0 million, due to higher salaries and benefits ($6.0 million) and higher office rent and general office expense ($1.0 million). On a per mcfe basis, general and administration expense (excluding stock based compensation) increased from $0.33 per mcfe in 2005 to $0.35 per mcfe in 2006. Interest expense for 2006 increased $18.8 million, or 48%, to $57.6 million with higher average interest rates, higher average debt balances and the refinancing of certain debt from short term floating to longer term fixed rates. In 2006, we issued $250.0 million of 7.5% senior subordinated notes which added $9.7 million of interest costs. The proceeds from this issuance were used to retire shorter term bank debt. In 2006, the average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility was $347.8 million with an average interest rate of 6.4% compared to an average debt outstanding in 2005 of $314.8 million with an average interest rates of 4.5%. 26 Table of Contents Depletion, depreciation and amortization, (DDA), increased $42.1 million, or 33%, due to higher production and higher depletion rates. DDA (excluding impairment) increased from $1.46 per mcfe in 2005 to $1.66 per mcfe in 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we lowered our salvage value estimates on our Appalachia wells which increased DDA expense by $4.6 million. In 2006, we also recorded impairment of $2.4 million on an offshore property due to declining oil and gas prices which added $0.02 per mcfe. For 2007, based on our current reserve base, we expect our DDA rate to average approximately $1.87 per mcfe. The increase in DDA per mcfe is related to our Stroud acquisition, increasing drilling costs and the mix of our production. Operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock based compensation, exploration expense and deferred compensation plan expense. In 2006, stock based compensation is a component of direct operating expense ($1.4 million), exploration expense ($3.1 million), general and administrative expense ($14.3 million) and a $320,000 reduction of gas transportation revenues for a total of $19.1 million. In 2005, stock based compensation is equal to $480,000 included in direct operating, $1.2 million included in exploration expense, $4.9 million included in general and administrative expense and a reduction of $117,000 of gas transportation revenues for a total of $6.7 million. This expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants in 2006 and 2005, expenses related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in 2006 and in 2005, the mark to market of SARs granted to employees. The increase in stock based compensation in 2006 is the result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) which requires expensing of stock options. Exploration expense increased 48% to $45.3 million due to higher seismic costs ($1.6 million), higher dry hole costs ($9.1 million) and higher personnel costs. The following table details our exploration related expenses (in thousands): Exploration expenses 2006 2005 Change % Dry hole expense $ 16,103 $ 7,045 $ 9,058 129 % Seismic 15,412 13,844 1,568 11 % Personnel expense 6,917 5,872 1,045 18 % Stock based compensation expense 3,079 1,250 1,829 146 % Other 3,741 2,593 1,148 44 % Total exploration expense $ 45,252 $ 30,604 $ 14,648 48 % Deferred compensation plan expense decreased 77%, or $22.6 million from 2005. This non cash expense relates to the increase or decrease in value of our common stock and other investments held in our deferred compensation plans. Our common stock price increased from $13.64 per share at the end of 2004 to $26.34 per share at the end of 2005 to $27.46 per share at the end of 2006. Income tax expense for 2006 increased $57.4 million, or 86%, over 2005 due to a 81% increase in income from continuing operations. Our effective tax rate was 39% for 2006 and was 37% for 2005. The twelve months ended December 31, 2006 includes a $2.8 million adjustment for changes in state tax rates. Given our available net operating loss carryforward, we do not expect to pay significant federal income taxes. We paid $1.8 million of state income taxes in 2006. Discontinued operations includes the operating results and impairment losses on the Austin Chalk properties which were acquired as part of the Stroud transaction. See also Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. Due to significant price declines subsequent to the purchase of these properties and volumes produced since the acquisition, we recognized impairment of $74.9 million. These properties were sold on February 13, 2007 for proceeds of $80.4 million. 27 Table of Contents Comparison of 2005 to 2004 Oil and gas revenue for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands) is summarized in the following table: 2005 2004 Change % Revenues Oil wellhead $ 161,627 $ 98,608 $ 63,019 64 % Oil hedges (44,273 ) (28,169 ) (16,104 ) 57 % Total oil revenue $ 117,354 $ 70,439 $ 46,915 67 % Gas wellhead $ 502,691 $ 293,769 $ 208,922 71 % Gas hedges (122,560 ) (68,031 ) (54,529 ) 80 % Total gas revenue $ 380,131 $ 225,738 $ 154,393 68 % NGL $ 31,891 $ 23,446 $ 8,445 36 % NGL hedges (4,302 ) (3,920 ) (382 ) 10 % Total NGL revenue $ 27,589 $ 19,526 $ 8,063 41 % Combined wellhead $ 696,209 $ 415,823 $ 280,386 67 % Combined hedges (171,135 ) (100,120 ) (71,015 ) 71 % Total oil and gas revenue $ 525,074 $ 315,703 $ 209,371 66 % Average realized price received for oil and gas during 2005 was $6.02 per mcfe, up 37% or $1.62 per mcfe from 2004. Oil and gas revenues for 2005 reached a record $525.1 million and were 66% higher than 2004 due to higher oil and gas prices and a 22% increase in production. The average price received in 2005 increased 38% to $38.71 per barrel for oil and increased 36% to $6.03 per mcf for gas. The effect of our hedging program decreased realized prices $1.96 per mcfe in 2005 versus a decrease of $1.40 in 2004. Production volumes increased 22% from 2004 due to our drilling program and additions from acquisitions consummated in 2004, primarily our purchase of the 50% of Great Lakes that we did not own and Pine Mountain. Production increased 15.5 Bcfe from 2004. Our production volumes increased 69% in our Appalachia Division, increased 14% in our Southwest Division and declined 26% in our Gulf Coast Division. Transportation and gathering revenue of $2.5 million increased $259,000 from 2004. This increase is primarily due to higher gas prices and additional throughput volumes offset by lower oil marketing revenue. Mark to market on oil and gas derivatives includes a gain of $10.9 million in 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2005, certain of our gas hedges no longer qualify for hedge accounting due to the effect of volatility of gas prices on the correlation between realized prices and hedge reference prices. Other revenue declined in 2005 to a loss of $2.6 million from a gain of $2.8 million in 2004. The 2005 period includes ineffective hedging losses due to widening basis differentials of $3.4 million. The 2004 period includes a gain on the sale of properties of $5.0 million and $712,000 of ineffective hedging gains offset by $2.0 million write down of an insurance claim receivable. The following table presents information about our operating expenses that generally trend with changes in production for 2005 and 2004: Operating expenses per mcfe 2005 2004 Change % Direct operating expense (excluding stock based compensation) $ 0.76 $ 0.65 $ 0.11 17 % Production and ad valorem tax expense 0.36 0.29 0.07 24 % General and administration expense (excluding stock based compensation of $0.06 per mcfe in 2005) 0.33 0.28 0.05 18 % Interest expense 0.44 0.32 0.12 38 % Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense (excluding impairment) 1.46 1.39 0.07 5 % 28 Table of Contents Direct operating expense (excluding stock based compensation) increased $20.3 million to $66.6 million due to increased costs from acquisitions, higher oilfield service costs and higher workover costs primarily in our Gulf Coast Division. Our operating expenses are increasing as we add new wells and maintain production from our existing properties. We incurred $7.4 million of expenses associated with workovers in 2005 versus $1.8 million in 2004. In 2005, 58% of our workover expenses were incurred by our Gulf Coast Division and were primarily hurricane related. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expenses (excluding stock based compensation) were $0.76 per mcfe and increased 17% or $0.11 per mcfe from 2004 consisting of higher field level costs ($0.04 per mcfe) and higher workover costs ($0.07 per mcfe). Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices and not hedged prices. These taxes increased $11.0 million, or 54%, from the same period of the prior year. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes increased from $0.29 per mcfe to $0.36 per mcfe due to higher market prices. General and administrative expense (excluding stock based compensation) for 2005 increased 42%, or $8.5 million, from 2004 with additional personnel costs due to the Great Lakes and Pine Mountain acquisitions ($1.8 million), higher salaries and benefits ($3.5 million), higher legal expenses ($1.3 million) and a $725,000 legal settlement accrual. On a per mcfe basis, general and administration expense (excluding stock based compensation) increased 17% from $0.28 per mcfe in 2004 to $0.33 per mcfe in 2005. Interest expense for 2005 increased $15.7 million, or 68%, to $38.8 million with higher average interest rates, higher average debt balances and the refinancing of certain debt from short term floating to longer term fixed rates. In March 2005, we issued $150.0 million of 6.375% senior subordinated notes which added $7.8 million of interest costs. The proceeds from this issuance were used to retire lower interest bank debt. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility was $314.8 million and $296.6 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively, and the average interest rates were 4.3% and 3.5%, respectively. Depletion, depreciation and amortization (DDA) increased $24.5 million, or 24%, due to higher production and higher depletion rates. DDA increased from $1.39 per mcfe in 2004 to $1.46 per mcfe in 2005. The twelve months ended December 31, 2004 includes a $3.6 million impairment charge on an offshore property in our Gulf Coast Division. Operating expenses also include stock based compensation, exploration expense and non cash compensation expense that generally do not trend with production. In 2005, stock based compensation expense is a component of direct operating expense ($480,000), exploration expense ($1.2 million) and general and administrative expense ($4.9 million). This expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants and the market to market of SARs granted to employees. In 2004, stock based compensation is a component of exploration expense ($24,000) and general and administrative expense ($541,000). Exploration expense increased 44% to $30.6 million due to higher seismic costs ($10.5 million), higher personnel costs, higher stock based compensation expense ($1.2 million), partially offset by lower dry hole costs ($5.0 million).

This non cash expense relates to the increase in value of our common stock and other investments held in our deferred compensation plans. Our common stock price increased from $13.64 per share at the end of 2004 to $26.34 per share at the end of 2005. Tax expense for 2005 increased $41.8 million, or 170%, over 2004 due to a 166% increase in income before taxes. Our effective tax rate for 2005 and 2004 was 37%. Given our available net operating loss carryforward, we do not expect to pay significant federal income taxes. 29 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity During 2006, our cash provided from continuing operations was $467.6 million, and we spent $898.6 million on capital expenditures (including acquisitions). During this period, financing activities provided net cash of $429.4 million. Our financing activities included the sale of $250.0 million of 7.5% senior subordinated notes and additional borrowings under our bank credit agreement. At December 31, 2006 we had $2.4 million in cash, total assets of $3.2 billion and a debt to capitalization ratio of 45.5%. Long term debt at December 31, 2006 totaled $1.0 billion, including $452.0 million of bank debt and $596.8 million of senior subordinated notes. Available borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility at December 31, 2006 was $348.0 million. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves which is typical in the oil and gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We believe that net cash generated from operating activities and unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility combined with our oil and gas price hedges currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near term financial obligations and liquidity needs. However, long term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and gas business. A material drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, reduce debt, meet financial obligations and remain profitable. We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of oil and gas, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proved reserves. Bank Debt We maintain an $800.0 million revolving credit facility, which we refer to as our bank debt or our bank credit facility. The bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and matures on October 25, 2011. Availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the banks semi annually with an option to set more often in certain circumstances. The borrowing base is dependent on a number of factors, primarily the lenders assessment of future cash flows. Redeterminations of the borrowing base require approval of 75% of the lenders; increases require unanimous approval. At February 22, 2007, the bank credit facility had a $1.2 billion borrowing base and an $800.0 million facility amount. Credit availability is equal to the lesser of the facility amount or the borrowing base resulting in credit availability of $287.0 million on February 20, 2007. The facility amount can be increased to the borrowing base with twenty days notice. Limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments as defined are imposed under our bank debt and our subordinated notes. Under the bank credit facility, common and preferred dividends are permitted. The terms of each of our subordinated notes limit restricted payments (including dividends) to the greater of $20.0 million or a formula based on earnings and equity issuances since the original issuances of the notes. At December 31, 2006, approximately $496.2 million was available under the restricted payment baskets for each of our subordinated notes. The bank credit facility provides for a restricted payment basket of $20.0 million plus 66 2/3% of net cash proceeds from common stock issuances and 50% of net income. Approximately $446.4 million was available under the bank credit facility restricted payment basket as of December 31, 2006. The debt agreements contain customary covenants relating to debt incurrence, working capital, dividends and financial ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2006. Cash Flow Our principal sources of cash are operating cash flow, bank borrowings and at times, issuance of debt and equity securities. Our operating cash flow is highly dependent on oil and gas prices. As of December 31, 2006, we had entered into hedging agreements covering 84.9 Bcfe and 71.7 Bcfe for 2007 and 2008. The $538.4 million of cash capital expenditures for 2006, excluding acquisitions, was funded with internal cash flow and borrowing under the bank credit facility. The $698.0 million capital budget for 2007, which excludes acquisitions, is expected to increase production and to expand the reserve base. Based on current projections, oil and gas futures prices and our hedge position, the 2007 capital program is expected to be funded with internal cash flow and asset sales. Net cash provided from continuing operations in 2006 was $467.6 million, compared with $325.7 million in 2005 and $209.2 million in 2004. In 2006, cash flow from continuing operations increased due to higher production 30 Table of Contents volumes and higher realized prices partially offset by increasing operating costs. In 2005, cash flow from operations increased due to higher production volumes and prices partially offset by increasing operating, exploration and interest expenses. In 2004, cash flow from operations increased due to higher volumes and prices partially offset by increasing operating costs. Net cash used in investing activities in 2006 was $911.7 million, compared with $432.4 million in 2005 and $624.3 million in 2004. In 2006, we spent $502.9 million in additions to oil and gas properties and $360.1 million on acquisitions. The 2005 period included $276.9 million in additions to oil and gas properties and $153.6 million of acquisitions. The 2004 period included $166.6 million in additions to oil and gas properties and $485.6 million of acquisitions. Net cash provided from financing activities in 2006 was $429.4 million compared with $93.0 million in 2005 and $432.8 million in 2004. Historically, sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and debt offerings. During 2006, we received proceeds of $249.5 million from the issuance of our 7.5% Notes. During 2005, we received proceeds of $150.0 million and $109.2 million from the issuance of our 6.375% Notes and a common stock offering. During 2005, the outstanding balance under our bank credit facility declined $154.7 million primarily due to the proceeds received from the 6.375% Notes being applied to our bank debt. During 2004, we received proceeds of $98.1 million and $246.1 million from the issuance of additional 7.375% Notes and two common stock offerings, respectively. During 2004, the outstanding balance under our bank credit facility increased $245.7 million with $70.0 million related to the Great Lakes acquisition and the remaining increase the result of funding other acquisitions. Also in 2004, we redeemed the remaining outstanding 6% Debentures for $11.6 million. Capital Requirements Our primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends. During 2006, $502.9 million of capital was expended on drilling projects. Also in 2006, $360.1 million was expended on acquisitions primarily to purchase producing properties. The capital program, excluding acquisitions, was funded by net cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility and our acquisitions were funded primarily with proceeds received from the issuance of our 7.5% Notes and borrowings under our credit facility. The 2007 capital budget of $698.0 million, excluding acquisitions, is expected to be funded by cash flow from operations and asset sales. In February 2007, we sold the Austin Chalk properties for proceeds of $80.4 million. Development and exploration activities are highly discretionary, and, for the foreseeable future, we expect such activities to be maintained at levels equal to internal cash flow and asset sales. To the extent capital requirements exceed internal cash flow and proceeds from asset sales, debt or equity may be issued to fund these requirements. The Stroud acquisition included the issuance of 6.5 million shares and the assumption of $106.7 million of debt. We currently believe we have sufficient liquidity and cash flow to meet our obligations for the next twelve months; however, a drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production or reserves could adversely affect our ability to fund capital expenditures and meet our financial obligations. Also, our obligations may change due to acquisitions, divestitures and continued growth. We may issue additional shares of stock, subordinated notes or other debt securities to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, extend maturities or to repay debt. Cash Dividend Payments The amount of future dividends is subject to declaration by the board of directors and depends on earnings, capital expenditures and various other factors, such as restrictions under our bank debt and our subordinated notes. In 2006, we paid $12.2 million in dividends to our common shareholders ($0.03 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.02 per share in the third, second and first quarters). In 2005, we paid $7.6 million in dividends to our common stockholders ($0.02 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.0133 per share in the third, second and first quarters). In 2004, we paid $3.2 million in dividends to our common stockholders ($0.0067 per share in the second and third quarters and $0.0133 per share in the fourth quarter). Also in 2005 and 2004, we paid $2.2 million and $2.9 million in preferred stock dividends. Future Commitments In addition to our capital expenditure program, we are committed to making cash payments in the future on two types of contracts: note agreements and operating leases. As of December 31, 2006, we do not have any capital leases nor have we entered into any material long term contracts for equipment. As of December 31, 2006, we do not have any off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party. The table below provides estimates of the timing of future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place at December 31, 2006. In addition to the contractual obligations listed on the table below, our balance sheet at December 31, 2006 reflects accrued interest payable on our bank debt of $925,000 which is payable in January 2007. We expect to make 31 Table of Contents annual interest payments of $14.8 million per year on our 7.375% Notes, $18.8 million per year on our 7.5% Notes and payments of $9.6 million per year on our 6.375% Notes. The following summarizes our contractual financial obligations at December 31, 2006 and their future maturities. We expect to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities, borrowings under the bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales proceeds. Payment due by period 2008 and 2010 and 2007 2009 2011 Thereafter Total (in thousands) Bank debt due 2011 $ $ $ 452,000 (a) $ $ 452,000 7.375% senior subordinated notes due 2013 200,000 200,000 6.375% senior subordinated notes due 2015 150,000 150,000 7.5% senior subordinated notes due 2016 250,000 250,000 Operating leases 5,010 10,236 6,431 9,610 31,287 Drilling contracts 12,830 2,160 14,990 Service contracts 1,794 3,705 2,754 8,253 Derivative obligations (b) 4,621 266 4,887 Asset retirement obligation liability 4,193 8,674 8,423 74,298 95,588 Total contractual obligations (c) $ 28,448 $ 25,041 $ 469,608 $ 683,908 $ 1,207,005 (a) Due at termination date of our bank credit facility, which we expect to renew, but there is no assurance that can be accomplished. Interest paid on our bank credit facility would be approximately $28.9 million each year assuming no change in the interest rate or outstanding balance. (b) Derivative obligations represent net open derivative contracts valued as of December 31, 2006. (c) This table does not include the liability for the deferred compensation plans since these obligations will be funded with existing plan assets. Hedging Oil and Gas Prices We enter into derivative agreements to reduce the impact of oil and gas price volatility on our operations. At December 31, 2006, swaps were in place covering 73.6 Bcf of gas at prices averaging $9.29 per mcf. We also had collars covering 56.1 Bcf of gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of $7.42 to $10.49 and 4.5 million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of $55.72 to $70.11. The derivative fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination, based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX, approximated a pretax gain of $149.8 million at December 31, 2006. The contracts expire monthly through December 2008. Transaction gains and losses are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases on oil and gas revenue in the period the hedged production is sold. Realized hedging losses of $46.5 million were recognized in 2006 compared to losses of $171.1 million in 2005 and losses of $100.1 million in 2004. Changes in the value of the ineffective portion of all open hedges are recognized in earnings quarterly in other revenue. Unrealized effective gains and losses on hedging positions are recorded at an estimate of fair value based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX, on our consolidated balance sheet as other comprehensive income (OCI) a component of stockholders equity. As of the fourth quarter of 2005, certain of our gas hedges no longer qualify for hedge accounting due to the effect of volatility of gas prices in the fourth quarter of 2005 and on the correlation between realized prices and hedge reference prices. These derivatives were marked to market in the amount of a gain of $10.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and as a gain of $86.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. 32 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding: Period Contract Type Volume Hedged Average Hedge Price Natural Gas 2007 Swaps 96,336 Mmbtu/day $9.13 2007 Collars 98,500 Mmbtu/day $7.13 $9.99 2008 Swaps 105,000 Mmbtu/day $9.42 2008 Collars 55,000 Mmbtu/day $7.93 $11.39 Crude Oil 2007 Collars 6,300 bbl/day $53.46 $65.33 2008 Collars 6,000 bbl/day $58.09 $75.11 Interest Rates At December 31, 2006, we had $1.0 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $600.0 million bears interest at fixed rates averaging 7.2%. Bank debt totaling $452.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 6.4% at year end 2006. The 30 day LIBOR rate on December 31, 2006 was 5.3%. A 1% increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2006 would cost us approximately $4.5 million in additional annual interest. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements to enhance liquidity and capital resource position, or for any other purpose. Inflation and Changes in Prices Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Oil and gas prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. In a trend that began in 2004 and accelerated during 2005 and 2006, commodity prices for oil and gas increased significantly. The higher prices have led to increased activity in the industry and, consequently, rising costs. These costs trends have put pressure not only on our operating costs but also on our capital costs. We expect further increases in these costs for 2007. 33 Table of Contents The following table indicates the average oil and gas prices received over the last five years and quarterly for 2006, 2005 and 2004.

The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable; however, actual results may differ. Certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (a) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to changes; and (b) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Oil and Gas Properties Proved reserves are defined by the SEC as those volumes of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Although our engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. Reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revisions, which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price and cost changes and other economic factors. Changes in oil and gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions in turn cause adjustments in the depletion rates utilized by us. We cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods. Reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our Vice President of Reservoir Engineering who reports directly to our Chief Operating Officer. To further ensure the reliability of our reserve estimates, we engage independent petroleum consultants to review our estimates of proved reserves. Historical variances between our reserve estimates and the aggregate estimates of our consultants have been less than 5%. The following table sets forth a summary of the percent of reserves which were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004. Audited(a) 2006 2005 2004 87% 84 % 88 % (a) Audited reserves are those reserves estimated by our employees and reviewed by an independent petroleum consultant. We utilize the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures. Unsuccessful exploration drilling costs are expensed and can have a significant effect on reported operating results. Successful exploration drilling costs and all development costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and gas reserves as estimated by our engineers and reviewed by independent engineers. Costs incurred for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot yet be classified as proved are capitalized on our balance sheet if (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and (b) we are making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Otherwise, well costs are expensed if a determination as to whether proved reserves were found cannot be made within one year following completion of drilling and these criteria are not met. Proven property leasehold costs are charged to expense using the units of production method based on total proved reserves. Unproved properties are assessed periodically (at least annually) and impairments to value are charged to expense. The successful efforts method inherently relies upon the estimation of proved reserves, which includes proved developed and proved undeveloped volumes. We adhere to the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies, for recognizing any impairment of capitalized costs to unproved properties. The greatest portion of these costs generally relate to the acquisition of leasehold costs. The costs are capitalized and periodically evaluated (at least annually) as to recoverability, based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in 35 Table of Contents business strategy employed by management. We consider a combination of time, geologic and engineering factors to evaluate the need for impairment of these costs. Unproved properties had a net book value of $226.3 million in 2006 compared to $28.6 million in 2005 and $14.8 million in 2004. Depletion rates are determined based on reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of producing properties. As the estimated reserves are adjusted, the depletion expense for a property will change, assuming no change in production volumes or the capitalized costs. Estimated reserves are used as the basis for calculating the expected future cash flows from a property, which are used to determine whether that property may be impaired. Reserves are also used to estimate the supplemental disclosure of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas producing activities and reserve quantities in Note 19, Supplemental Information on Natural Gas and Oil Exploration, Development and Production Activities to our consolidated financial statements. Changes in the estimated reserves are considered in estimates for accounting purposes and are reflected on a prospective basis. We monitor our long lived assets recorded in property, plant and equipment in our consolidated balance sheet to ensure they are fairly presented. We must evaluate our properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices, an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and gas reserves that will be produced from a field, the timing of future production, future production costs, future abandonment costs, and future inflation. The need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors, including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or gas, unfavorable adjustment to reserves, physical damage to production equipment and facilities, a change in costs, or other changes to contracts, environmental regulations or tax laws. All of these factors must be considered when testing a propertys carrying value for impairment. We cannot predict whether impairment charges may be required in the future. We are required to develop estimates of fair value to allocate purchase prices paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed under the purchase method of accounting. The purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for information on these acquisitions. Derivatives We use commodity derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil and gas price volatility. We account for our commodity derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. For derivative contracts designated as hedges, earnings are affected by the ineffective portion of a hedge contract (changes in realized prices that do not match the changes in the hedge price). Ineffective gains or losses are recorded in other revenue while the hedge contract is open and may increase or reverse until settlement of the contract. This may result in significant volatility to current period income. For derivatives qualifying as hedges, the effective portion of any changes in fair value is recognized in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income (OCI), and then reclassified to earnings, in oil and gas revenue, when the hedged transaction is consummated. This may result in significant volatility in stockholders equity. The fair value of open hedging contracts is an estimated amount that could be realized upon termination. As of the fourth quarter of 2005, certain of our gas hedges no longer qualify for hedge accounting due to the volatility of gas prices and their effect on our basis differentials and are marked to market. The commodity derivatives we use include commodity collars and swaps. While there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising prices may not be captured, we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important. Among these benefits are a more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions, the flexibility to enter into long term projects requiring substantial committed capital, smoother and more efficient execution of our ongoing development drilling and production enhancement programs, more consistent returns on invested capital, and better access to bank and other credit markets. Asset Retirement Obligations We have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires us to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. 36 Table of Contents Inherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate retirement costs, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of retirement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation, (ARO), a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. In addition, increases in the discounted ARO liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense, a component of depletion, depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statement of operations. Deferred Taxes We are subject to income and other taxes in all areas in which we operate. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required because income tax returns are generally filed many months after the close of a calendar year, tax returns are subject to audit which can take years to complete and future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized. We have deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences. We routinely evaluate deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization. A valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when we believe that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized. In determining deferred tax liabilities, accounting rules require OCI to be considered, even though such income or loss has not yet been earned. At year end 2005, deferred tax liabilities exceeded deferred tax assets by $113.1 million, with $85.5 million of deferred tax assets related to unrealized deferred hedging losses included in OCI. At year end 2006, deferred tax liabilities exceeded deferred tax assets by $468.6 million, with $21.3 million of deferred tax liabilities related to unrealized hedging gains included in OCI. We may be challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in our various income tax returns. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for all taxes, gains or losses could occur in the future due to changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding tax matters. Contingent Liabilities A provision for legal, environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost or range of cost can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal, environmental and contingent matters. In addition, we often must estimate the amount of such losses. In many cases, our judgment is based on the input of our legal advisors and on the interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or the courts. We monitor known and potential legal, environmental and other contingent matters and make our best estimate of when to record losses for these matters based on available information. Although we continue to monitor all contingencies closely, particularly our outstanding litigation, we currently have no material accruals for contingent liabilities. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but may require some entities to change their measurement practices. For Range, SFAS No. 157 will be effective January 1, 2008, with early application permitted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of this statement. In July 2006, FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 was issued. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The new standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. For Range, the provisions of FIN 48 are effective January 1, 2007. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 will be recorded in retained earnings. Range is currently evaluating the provisions of FIN 48 to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements but we do not expect a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposure. All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are US dollar denominated. Market Risk Our major market risk is exposure to oil and gas prices. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American gas production. Oil and gas prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. Commodity Price Risk We periodically enter into derivative arrangements with respect to our oil and gas production. These arrangements are intended to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations. Certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program also includes collars which assume a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. The majority of our derivatives qualify as accounting hedges. In times of increasing price volatility, we may experience losses from our hedging arrangements and increased basis differentials at the delivery points where we market our production. Widening basis differentials occur when the physical delivery market prices do not increase proportionately to the increased prices in the financial trading markets. Realized gains and losses are recognized in oil and gas revenues when the associated production occurs. Gains or losses on open contracts are recorded either in current period income or other comprehensive income. Generally, derivative losses occur when market prices increase, which are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transaction. Conversely, derivative gains occur when market prices decrease, which are offset by losses on the underlying commodity transaction. Ineffective gains and losses are recognized in earnings as a component of other revenue. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes. Though not all of our derivatives qualify as accounting hedges, the purpose of entering into the contracts is to economically hedge oil and gas prices. Those that do not qualify as accounting hedges are marked to market through earnings. As of December 31, 2006, we had oil and gas swaps in place covering 73.6 Bcf of gas. We also had collars covering 56.1 Bcf of gas and 4.5 million barrels of oil. These contracts expire monthly through December 2008. The fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of December 31, 2006, approximated a net pre tax gain of $149.8 million. Gains or losses realized on hedging transactions are determined monthly based upon the difference between contract price received by us for the sale of our hedged production and the hedge price, generally closing prices on the NYMEX. These gains and losses are included as increases or decreases to oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold. In 2006, pre tax losses were realized in the amount of $46.5 million compared to losses of $171.1 million in 2005 and losses of $100.1 million in 2004. Gains and losses due to commodity hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings in other revenues in our consolidated statement of operations. The ineffective portion of hedges that qualified for hedge accounting was a gain of $6.0 million in 2006 compared to a loss of $3.4 million in 2005 and a gain of $712,000 in 2004. Other Commodity Risk We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity prices changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. As of the fourth quarter of 2005, certain of our gas hedges no longer qualify for hedge accounting due to the volatility in gas prices and its effect on our basis differentials and are marked to market. This resulted in a gain of $10.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to a gain of $86.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 in the income statement category called mark to market on oil and gas derivatives. 38 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding: Period Contract Type Volume Hedged Average Hedge Price Natural Gas 2007 Swaps 96,336 Mmbtu/day $9.13 2007 Collars 98,500 Mmbtu/day $7.13 $9.99 2008 Swaps 105,000 Mmbtu/day $9.42 2008 Collars 55,000 Mmbtu/day $7.93 $11.39 Crude Oil 2007 Collars 6,300 bbl/day $53.46 $65.33 2008 Collars 6,000 bbl/day $58.09 $75.11 In 2006, a 10% reduction in oil and gas prices, excluding amounts fixed through hedging transactions, would have reduced revenue by $73.4 million. If oil and gas futures prices at December 31, 2006 had declined by 10%, the unrealized hedging gain at that date would have increased $74.8 million. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2006, we had $1.0 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $600.0 million bears interest at a fixed rate averaging 7.2%. Bank debt totaling $452.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 6.4% on that date. On December 31, 2006, the 30 day LIBOR rate was 5.3%. A 1% increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2006 would cost us approximately $4.5 million in additional annual interest rates. 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion is intended to assist you in understanding our business and results of operations together with our present financial condition. This section should be read in conjunction with Item 6, Selected Financial Data and our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. Statements in our discussion may be forward looking. These forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. We caution that a number of factors could cause future production, revenues and expenses to differ materially from our expectations. See Disclosures Regarding Forward Looking Statements at the beginning of this Annual Report and Risk Factors in Item 1A. for additional discussion of some of these factors and risks. Overview of Our Business We are an independent natural gas and oil company engaged in the exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, primarily in the Southwestern, Appalachian and Gulf Coast regions of the United States. We operate in one segment. We have a single company wide management team that administers all properties as a whole rather than by discrete operating segments. We track only basic operational data by area. We do not maintain complete separate financial statement information by area. We measure financial performance as a single enterprise and not on an area by area basis. Our strategy is to increase reserves and production through internally generated drilling projects coupled with complementary acquisitions. Our revenues, profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for oil and gas and on our ability to find, develop and acquire oil and gas reserves that are economically recoverable. We use the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas activities. Industry Environment We operate entirely within the United States, a mature region for the exploration and production of oil and gas. As a mature region, while new discoveries of oil and gas occur in the United States, the size and frequency of these discoveries is declining, while finding and development costs are increasing. We believe that there remain areas of the United States, such as the Appalachian basin and certain areas in our Southwest and Gulf Coast Divisions, which are underexplored or have not been fully explored and developed with the benefit of newly available exploration, production and reserve enhancement technology. Examples of such technology include advanced 3 D seismic processing, hydraulic reservoir fracture stimulation, advances in well logging and analysis, horizontal drilling and completion techniques, secondary and tertiary recovery practices, and automated remote well monitoring and control devices. Another characteristic of a mature region is the historical exit of larger independent producers and major oil companies from such regions. These companies, searching for ever larger new discoveries, have ventured increasingly overseas and offshore, de emphasizing their onshore United States assets. This movement out of mature basins by larger companies has provided acquisition opportunities for companies like ours that maintain well equipped technical teams capable of generating additional value from these assets. In other situations, to increase cash flow without increasing capital spending, larger independent producers and major integrated oil companies have allowed smaller companies the opportunity to explore and develop reserves on their undeveloped acreage through joint ventures and farm in arrangements. We believe the acquisition market for natural gas properties has become extremely competitive as producers vie for additional production and expanded drilling opportunities. Acquisition values have reached historic highs and we expect these values to remain high in 2007. In addition, we expect drilling and service costs to remain at a high level in 2007 and for lease operating expenses to continue to rise as producers are forced to make operational enhancements to maintain aging fields. Natural gas is a commodity. The price that we receive for the natural gas we produce is largely a function of market supply and demand. Demand for natural gas in the United States has increased dramatically over the last ten years. Demand is impacted by general economic conditions, estimates of gas in storage, weather and other seasonal condition, including hurricanes and tropical storms. Market conditions involving over or under supply of natural gas can result in substantial price volatility. Historically, commodity prices have been volatile and we expect the volatility to continue in the future. A substantial or extended decline in oil and gas prices or poor drilling results could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows, quantities of oil and gas reserves that may be economically produced and our ability to access capital markets. 22 Table of Contents Source of Our Revenues We derive our revenues from the sale of natural gas and oil that is produced from our properties. Revenues are a function of the volume produced and the prevailing market price at the time of sale. The price of oil and natural gas is the primary factor affecting our revenues. To achieve more predictable cash flows and to reduce our exposure to downward price fluctuations, we utilize derivative instruments to hedge future sales prices on a significant portion of our natural gas and oil production. During 2006, 2005 and 2004 the use of derivative instruments prevented us from realizing the full benefit of upward price movements and may continue to do so in future periods. Principal Components of Our Cost Structure Direct Operating Expenses. These are day to day costs incurred to bring hydrocarbons out of the ground and to the market together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties. Such costs also include workovers and repairs to our oil and gas properties not covered by insurance. These costs are expected to remain high in 2007 as the demand for these services continues to increase. Direct operating expense includes stock based compensation expense (non cash) associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), amortization of restricted stock grants and mark to market of SARs as part of employee compensation. Production and Ad Valorem Taxes. These costs are primarily paid based on a percentage of market prices and not on hedged prices of production or at fixed rates established by federal, state or local taxing authorities. Exploration Expense. Geological and geophysical costs, seismic costs, delay rentals and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells or dry holes. Exploration expense includes stock based compensation expense (non cash) associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), amortization of restricted stock grants and mark to market of SARs as part of employee compensation. General and Administrative Expense. Overhead, including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff, costs of maintaining our headquarters, costs of managing our production and development operations, audit and other professional fees and legal compliance are included in general and administrative expense. General and administrative expense includes stock based compensation expense (non cash) associated with the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R), amortization of restricted stock grants and mark to market of SARs as part of employee compensation. Interest. We typically finance a portion of our working capital requirements and acquisitions with borrowings under our bank credit facility and with our longer term public traded debt securities. As a result, we incur substantial interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions. We may continue to incur significant interest expense as we continue to grow. We expect our 2007 capital budget to be funded with internal cash flow and asset sales. Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization. The systematic expensing of the capital costs incurred to acquire, explore and develop natural gas and oil. As a successful efforts company, we capitalize all costs associated with our acquisition and development efforts and all successful exploration efforts, and apportion these costs to each unit of production through depreciation, depletion and amortization expense. This also includes the systematic, monthly accretion of the future abandonment costs of tangible assets such as platforms, wells, service assets, pipelines, and other facilities. Income Taxes. We are subject to state and federal income taxes but are currently not in a tax paying position for regular federal income taxes, primarily due to the current deductibility of intangible drilling costs (IDC). We do pay some state income taxes where our IDC deductions do not exceed our taxable income or where state income taxes are determined on another basis. Currently, all of our federal taxes are deferred; however, at some point, we will utilize all of our net operating loss carryforwards and we will recognize current income tax expense and continue to recognize current tax expense as long as we are generating taxable income. 23 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Income and Operations Volumes and Price Data 2006 2005 2004 Production: Crude oil (bbls) 3,159,623 3,031,468 2,512,434 NGLs (bbls) 1,091,785 1,011,692 988,192 Natural gas (mcf) 75,266,847 63,003,600 50,722,121 Total (mcfe) (a) 100,775,295 87,262,560 71,725,877 Average daily production: Crude oil (bbls) 8,656 8,305 6,865 NGLs (bbls) 2,991 2,772 2,700 Natural gas (mcf) 206,210 172,613 138,585 Total (mcfe) (a) 276,097 239,076 195,972 Average sales prices (excluding hedging): Crude oil (per bbl) $ 62.60 $ 53.31 $ 39.25 NGLs (per bbl) 33.62 31.52 23.73 Natural gas (per mcf) 6.58 7.98 5.79 Total (per mcfe) (a) 7.25 7.98 5.80 Average sales prices (including hedging): Crude oil (per bbl) $ 47.27 $ 38.71 $ 28.04 NGLs (per bbl) 33.62 27.27 19.76 Natural gas (per mcf) 6.61 6.03 4.45 Total (per mcfe) (a) 6.79 6.02 4.40 Average NYMEX prices (b) Oil (per bbl) $ 66.22 $ 56.56 $ 41.42 Natural gas (per mcf) 7.26 8.55 6.09 (a) Oil and NGLs are converted to mcfe at the rate of one barrel equals six mcfe.

Our 2006 performance reflects another year of successfully executing our strategy of growth through drilling and complementary acquisitions. The business of exploring for, developing, and acquiring oil and gas is highly competitive and capital intensive. As in any commodity business, the costs associated with finding, acquiring, extracting, and financing the operation are critical to profitability and long term value creation for stockholders. Generating meaningful growth while containing costs represents an ongoing challenge for management. During periods of historically high oil and gas prices, such as 2005 and 2006, drilling service and operating cost increases are more prevalent due to increased competition for goods and services. We faced other challenges in 2006 including attracting and retaining qualified personnel, consummating and integrating acquisitions, and accessing the capital markets to fund our growth and capital simplification process on sufficiently favorable terms. We have continued to expand and improve the technical staff through the hiring of additional experienced professionals. Our inventory of exploration and development prospects continues to build, providing new growth opportunities, greater diversification of technical risk and better efficiency. Total revenues increased 46% in 2006 over the same period of 2005. This increase is due to higher production and realized oil and gas prices. Our 2006 production growth is due to acquisitions completed in 2006 and to the continued success of our drilling program. Realized prices were higher by 13% in 2006 reflecting the expiration of lower priced oil and gas hedges. As discussed in Item 1A of this report, significant changes in oil and gas prices can have a significant impact on our balance sheet and our results of operations, particularly on the fair value of our derivatives. Comparison of 2006 to 2005 Oil and gas revenue for the years ended December 31, 2006 and 2005 (in thousands) is summarized in the following table: 2006 2005 Change % Revenues: Oil wellhead $ 197,815 $ 161,627 $ 36,188 22 % Oil hedges (48,445 ) (44,273 ) (4,172 ) 9 % Total oil revenue $ 149,370 $ 117,354 $ 32,016 27 % Gas wellhead $ 495,920 $ 502,691 $ (6,771 ) 1 % Gas hedges 1,934 (122,560 ) 124,494 102 % Total gas revenue $ 497,854 $ 380,131 $ 117,723 31 % NGL $ 36,704 $ 31,891 $ 4,813 15 % NGL hedges (4,302 ) 4,302 100 % Total NGL revenue $ 36,704 $ 27,589 $ 9,115 33 % Combined wellhead $ 730,439 $ 696,209 $ 34,230 5 % Combined hedges (46,511 ) (171,135 ) 124,624 73 % Total oil and gas revenue $ 683,928 $ 525,074 $ 158,854 30 % 25 Table of Contents Average realized price received for oil and gas during 2006 was $6.79 per mcfe, up 13% or $0.77 per mcfe from 2005. Oil and gas revenues for 2006 reached a record $683.9 million and were 30% higher than 2005 due to higher realized oil and gas prices and a 15% increase in production. The average price received increased 22% to $47.27 per barrel for oil and increased 10% to $6.61 per mcf for gas from 2005. The effect of our hedging program decreased realized prices $0.46 per mcfe in 2006 versus a decrease of $1.96 in 2005. Production volumes increased 15% from 2005 due to continued drilling success and additions from acquisitions consummated in 2006. Production increased 13.5 Bcfe from 2005. Our production volumes increased 10% in our Appalachia Division, increased 29% in our Southwest Division and declined 22% in our Gulf Coast Division. Mark to market on oil and gas derivatives includes a gain of $86.5 million in 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2005, certain of our gas hedges no longer qualified for hedge accounting due to the effect of gas price volatility on the correlation between realized prices and hedge reference prices. Other revenue increased in 2006 to a gain of $6.8 million from a loss of $2.6 million in 2005. The 2006 period includes $6.0 million of ineffective hedging gains and income from equity method investments of $548,000. The 2005 period includes ineffective hedging losses of $3.4 million. Our operating expenses have increased as we continue to grow. We believe most of our operating expense fluctuations should be analyzed on a unit of production, or per mcfe basis. The following table presents information about our operating expenses on an mcfe basis for 2006 and 2005: Operating expenses per mcfe 2006 2005 Change % Direct operating expense (excluding $0.01 per mcfe stock based compensation in 2006) $ 0.90 $ 0.76 $ 0.14 18 % Production and ad valorem tax expense 0.37 0.36 0.01 3 % General and administrative expense (excluding stock based compensation of $0.14 per mcfe in 2006 and $0.06 per mcfe in 2005) 0.35 0.33 0.02 6 % Interest expense 0.57 0.44 0.13 30 % Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense (excluding impairment) 1.66 1.46 0.20 14 % Direct operating expense (excluding stock based compensation) increased $24.2 million to $90.8 million due to higher oilfield service costs, higher volumes and the integration of our recent acquisitions. Our operating expenses are increasing as we add new wells and maintain production from our existing properties. We incurred $6.7 million of expenses associated with workovers in 2006 versus $7.4 million in 2005. In 2006, 54% of our workover expenses were incurred by our Gulf Coast division and were primarily hurricane related. In 2005, 58% of our workover expenses were incurred by our Gulf Coast Division and were primarily hurricane related. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expenses (excluding stock based compensation) were $0.90 per mcfe and increased $0.14 per mcfe from 2005 with the increase consisting primarily of higher offshore well insurance ($0.02 per mcfe), higher utilities ($0.02 per mcfe), and higher water disposal and equipment costs ($0.06 per mcfe). Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices and not hedged prices. These taxes increased $5.4 million, or 17%, from the same period of the prior year. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes increased from $0.36 per mcfe in 2005 to $0.37 per mcfe in 2006 due to higher market prices. General and administrative expense (excluding stock based compensation) for 2006 increased 25%, or $7.0 million, due to higher salaries and benefits ($6.0 million) and higher office rent and general office expense ($1.0 million). On a per mcfe basis, general and administration expense (excluding stock based compensation) increased from $0.33 per mcfe in 2005 to $0.35 per mcfe in 2006. Interest expense for 2006 increased $18.8 million, or 48%, to $57.6 million with higher average interest rates, higher average debt balances and the refinancing of certain debt from short term floating to longer term fixed rates. In 2006, we issued $250.0 million of 7.5% senior subordinated notes which added $9.7 million of interest costs. The proceeds from this issuance were used to retire shorter term bank debt. In 2006, the average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility was $347.8 million with an average interest rate of 6.4% compared to an average debt outstanding in 2005 of $314.8 million with an average interest rates of 4.5%. 26 Table of Contents Depletion, depreciation and amortization, (DDA), increased $42.1 million, or 33%, due to higher production and higher depletion rates. DDA (excluding impairment) increased from $1.46 per mcfe in 2005 to $1.66 per mcfe in 2006. In the fourth quarter of 2006, we lowered our salvage value estimates on our Appalachia wells which increased DDA expense by $4.6 million. In 2006, we also recorded impairment of $2.4 million on an offshore property due to declining oil and gas prices which added $0.02 per mcfe. For 2007, based on our current reserve base, we expect our DDA rate to average approximately $1.87 per mcfe. The increase in DDA per mcfe is related to our Stroud acquisition, increasing drilling costs and the mix of our production. Operating expenses also include other expenses that generally do not trend with production. These expenses include stock based compensation, exploration expense and deferred compensation plan expense. In 2006, stock based compensation is a component of direct operating expense ($1.4 million), exploration expense ($3.1 million), general and administrative expense ($14.3 million) and a $320,000 reduction of gas transportation revenues for a total of $19.1 million. In 2005, stock based compensation is equal to $480,000 included in direct operating, $1.2 million included in exploration expense, $4.9 million included in general and administrative expense and a reduction of $117,000 of gas transportation revenues for a total of $6.7 million. This expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants in 2006 and 2005, expenses related to the adoption of SFAS No. 123(R) in 2006 and in 2005, the mark to market of SARs granted to employees. The increase in stock based compensation in 2006 is the result of adopting SFAS No. 123(R) which requires expensing of stock options. Exploration expense increased 48% to $45.3 million due to higher seismic costs ($1.6 million), higher dry hole costs ($9.1 million) and higher personnel costs. The following table details our exploration related expenses (in thousands): Exploration expenses 2006 2005 Change % Dry hole expense $ 16,103 $ 7,045 $ 9,058 129 % Seismic 15,412 13,844 1,568 11 % Personnel expense 6,917 5,872 1,045 18 % Stock based compensation expense 3,079 1,250 1,829 146 % Other 3,741 2,593 1,148 44 % Total exploration expense $ 45,252 $ 30,604 $ 14,648 48 % Deferred compensation plan expense decreased 77%, or $22.6 million from 2005. This non cash expense relates to the increase or decrease in value of our common stock and other investments held in our deferred compensation plans. Our common stock price increased from $13.64 per share at the end of 2004 to $26.34 per share at the end of 2005 to $27.46 per share at the end of 2006. Income tax expense for 2006 increased $57.4 million, or 86%, over 2005 due to a 81% increase in income from continuing operations. Our effective tax rate was 39% for 2006 and was 37% for 2005. The twelve months ended December 31, 2006 includes a $2.8 million adjustment for changes in state tax rates. Given our available net operating loss carryforward, we do not expect to pay significant federal income taxes. We paid $1.8 million of state income taxes in 2006. Discontinued operations includes the operating results and impairment losses on the Austin Chalk properties which were acquired as part of the Stroud transaction. See also Note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. Due to significant price declines subsequent to the purchase of these properties and volumes produced since the acquisition, we recognized impairment of $74.9 million. These properties were sold on February 13, 2007 for proceeds of $80.4 million. 27 Table of Contents Comparison of 2005 to 2004 Oil and gas revenue for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004 (in thousands) is summarized in the following table: 2005 2004 Change % Revenues Oil wellhead $ 161,627 $ 98,608 $ 63,019 64 % Oil hedges (44,273 ) (28,169 ) (16,104 ) 57 % Total oil revenue $ 117,354 $ 70,439 $ 46,915 67 % Gas wellhead $ 502,691 $ 293,769 $ 208,922 71 % Gas hedges (122,560 ) (68,031 ) (54,529 ) 80 % Total gas revenue $ 380,131 $ 225,738 $ 154,393 68 % NGL $ 31,891 $ 23,446 $ 8,445 36 % NGL hedges (4,302 ) (3,920 ) (382 ) 10 % Total NGL revenue $ 27,589 $ 19,526 $ 8,063 41 % Combined wellhead $ 696,209 $ 415,823 $ 280,386 67 % Combined hedges (171,135 ) (100,120 ) (71,015 ) 71 % Total oil and gas revenue $ 525,074 $ 315,703 $ 209,371 66 % Average realized price received for oil and gas during 2005 was $6.02 per mcfe, up 37% or $1.62 per mcfe from 2004. Oil and gas revenues for 2005 reached a record $525.1 million and were 66% higher than 2004 due to higher oil and gas prices and a 22% increase in production. The average price received in 2005 increased 38% to $38.71 per barrel for oil and increased 36% to $6.03 per mcf for gas. The effect of our hedging program decreased realized prices $1.96 per mcfe in 2005 versus a decrease of $1.40 in 2004. Production volumes increased 22% from 2004 due to our drilling program and additions from acquisitions consummated in 2004, primarily our purchase of the 50% of Great Lakes that we did not own and Pine Mountain. Production increased 15.5 Bcfe from 2004. Our production volumes increased 69% in our Appalachia Division, increased 14% in our Southwest Division and declined 26% in our Gulf Coast Division. Transportation and gathering revenue of $2.5 million increased $259,000 from 2004. This increase is primarily due to higher gas prices and additional throughput volumes offset by lower oil marketing revenue. Mark to market on oil and gas derivatives includes a gain of $10.9 million in 2005. In the fourth quarter of 2005, certain of our gas hedges no longer qualify for hedge accounting due to the effect of volatility of gas prices on the correlation between realized prices and hedge reference prices. Other revenue declined in 2005 to a loss of $2.6 million from a gain of $2.8 million in 2004. The 2005 period includes ineffective hedging losses due to widening basis differentials of $3.4 million. The 2004 period includes a gain on the sale of properties of $5.0 million and $712,000 of ineffective hedging gains offset by $2.0 million write down of an insurance claim receivable. The following table presents information about our operating expenses that generally trend with changes in production for 2005 and 2004: Operating expenses per mcfe 2005 2004 Change % Direct operating expense (excluding stock based compensation) $ 0.76 $ 0.65 $ 0.11 17 % Production and ad valorem tax expense 0.36 0.29 0.07 24 % General and administration expense (excluding stock based compensation of $0.06 per mcfe in 2005) 0.33 0.28 0.05 18 % Interest expense 0.44 0.32 0.12 38 % Depletion, depreciation and amortization expense (excluding impairment) 1.46 1.39 0.07 5 % 28 Table of Contents Direct operating expense (excluding stock based compensation) increased $20.3 million to $66.6 million due to increased costs from acquisitions, higher oilfield service costs and higher workover costs primarily in our Gulf Coast Division. Our operating expenses are increasing as we add new wells and maintain production from our existing properties. We incurred $7.4 million of expenses associated with workovers in 2005 versus $1.8 million in 2004. In 2005, 58% of our workover expenses were incurred by our Gulf Coast Division and were primarily hurricane related. On a per mcfe basis, direct operating expenses (excluding stock based compensation) were $0.76 per mcfe and increased 17% or $0.11 per mcfe from 2004 consisting of higher field level costs ($0.04 per mcfe) and higher workover costs ($0.07 per mcfe). Production and ad valorem taxes are paid based on market prices and not hedged prices. These taxes increased $11.0 million, or 54%, from the same period of the prior year. On a per mcfe basis, production and ad valorem taxes increased from $0.29 per mcfe to $0.36 per mcfe due to higher market prices. General and administrative expense (excluding stock based compensation) for 2005 increased 42%, or $8.5 million, from 2004 with additional personnel costs due to the Great Lakes and Pine Mountain acquisitions ($1.8 million), higher salaries and benefits ($3.5 million), higher legal expenses ($1.3 million) and a $725,000 legal settlement accrual. On a per mcfe basis, general and administration expense (excluding stock based compensation) increased 17% from $0.28 per mcfe in 2004 to $0.33 per mcfe in 2005. Interest expense for 2005 increased $15.7 million, or 68%, to $38.8 million with higher average interest rates, higher average debt balances and the refinancing of certain debt from short term floating to longer term fixed rates. In March 2005, we issued $150.0 million of 6.375% senior subordinated notes which added $7.8 million of interest costs. The proceeds from this issuance were used to retire lower interest bank debt. Average debt outstanding on the bank credit facility was $314.8 million and $296.6 million for 2005 and 2004, respectively, and the average interest rates were 4.3% and 3.5%, respectively. Depletion, depreciation and amortization (DDA) increased $24.5 million, or 24%, due to higher production and higher depletion rates. DDA increased from $1.39 per mcfe in 2004 to $1.46 per mcfe in 2005. The twelve months ended December 31, 2004 includes a $3.6 million impairment charge on an offshore property in our Gulf Coast Division. Operating expenses also include stock based compensation, exploration expense and non cash compensation expense that generally do not trend with production. In 2005, stock based compensation expense is a component of direct operating expense ($480,000), exploration expense ($1.2 million) and general and administrative expense ($4.9 million). This expense represents the amortization of restricted stock grants and the market to market of SARs granted to employees. In 2004, stock based compensation is a component of exploration expense ($24,000) and general and administrative expense ($541,000). Exploration expense increased 44% to $30.6 million due to higher seismic costs ($10.5 million), higher personnel costs, higher stock based compensation expense ($1.2 million), partially offset by lower dry hole costs ($5.0 million).

This non cash expense relates to the increase in value of our common stock and other investments held in our deferred compensation plans. Our common stock price increased from $13.64 per share at the end of 2004 to $26.34 per share at the end of 2005. Tax expense for 2005 increased $41.8 million, or 170%, over 2004 due to a 166% increase in income before taxes. Our effective tax rate for 2005 and 2004 was 37%. Given our available net operating loss carryforward, we do not expect to pay significant federal income taxes. 29 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition, Cash Flows and Liquidity During 2006, our cash provided from continuing operations was $467.6 million, and we spent $898.6 million on capital expenditures (including acquisitions). During this period, financing activities provided net cash of $429.4 million. Our financing activities included the sale of $250.0 million of 7.5% senior subordinated notes and additional borrowings under our bank credit agreement. At December 31, 2006 we had $2.4 million in cash, total assets of $3.2 billion and a debt to capitalization ratio of 45.5%. Long term debt at December 31, 2006 totaled $1.0 billion, including $452.0 million of bank debt and $596.8 million of senior subordinated notes. Available borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility at December 31, 2006 was $348.0 million. Cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and reserves which is typical in the oil and gas industry. Future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding or acquiring additional reserves. We believe that net cash generated from operating activities and unused committed borrowing capacity under the bank credit facility combined with our oil and gas price hedges currently in place will be adequate to satisfy near term financial obligations and liquidity needs. However, long term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and gas business. A material drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production and reserves would reduce our ability to fund capital expenditures, reduce debt, meet financial obligations and remain profitable. We operate in an environment with numerous financial and operating risks, including, but not limited to, the inherent risks of the search for, development and production of oil and gas, the ability to buy properties and sell production at prices which provide an attractive return and the highly competitive nature of the industry. Our ability to expand our reserve base is, in part, dependent on obtaining sufficient capital through internal cash flow, bank borrowings or the issuance of debt or equity securities. There can be no assurance that internal cash flow and other capital sources will provide sufficient funds to maintain capital expenditures that we believe are necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proved reserves. Bank Debt We maintain an $800.0 million revolving credit facility, which we refer to as our bank debt or our bank credit facility. The bank credit facility is secured by substantially all of our assets and matures on October 25, 2011. Availability under the bank credit facility is subject to a borrowing base set by the banks semi annually with an option to set more often in certain circumstances. The borrowing base is dependent on a number of factors, primarily the lenders assessment of future cash flows. Redeterminations of the borrowing base require approval of 75% of the lenders; increases require unanimous approval. At February 22, 2007, the bank credit facility had a $1.2 billion borrowing base and an $800.0 million facility amount. Credit availability is equal to the lesser of the facility amount or the borrowing base resulting in credit availability of $287.0 million on February 20, 2007. The facility amount can be increased to the borrowing base with twenty days notice. Limitations on the payment of dividends and other restricted payments as defined are imposed under our bank debt and our subordinated notes. Under the bank credit facility, common and preferred dividends are permitted. The terms of each of our subordinated notes limit restricted payments (including dividends) to the greater of $20.0 million or a formula based on earnings and equity issuances since the original issuances of the notes. At December 31, 2006, approximately $496.2 million was available under the restricted payment baskets for each of our subordinated notes. The bank credit facility provides for a restricted payment basket of $20.0 million plus 66 2/3% of net cash proceeds from common stock issuances and 50% of net income. Approximately $446.4 million was available under the bank credit facility restricted payment basket as of December 31, 2006. The debt agreements contain customary covenants relating to debt incurrence, working capital, dividends and financial ratios. We were in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2006. Cash Flow Our principal sources of cash are operating cash flow, bank borrowings and at times, issuance of debt and equity securities. Our operating cash flow is highly dependent on oil and gas prices. As of December 31, 2006, we had entered into hedging agreements covering 84.9 Bcfe and 71.7 Bcfe for 2007 and 2008. The $538.4 million of cash capital expenditures for 2006, excluding acquisitions, was funded with internal cash flow and borrowing under the bank credit facility. The $698.0 million capital budget for 2007, which excludes acquisitions, is expected to increase production and to expand the reserve base. Based on current projections, oil and gas futures prices and our hedge position, the 2007 capital program is expected to be funded with internal cash flow and asset sales. Net cash provided from continuing operations in 2006 was $467.6 million, compared with $325.7 million in 2005 and $209.2 million in 2004. In 2006, cash flow from continuing operations increased due to higher production 30 Table of Contents volumes and higher realized prices partially offset by increasing operating costs. In 2005, cash flow from operations increased due to higher production volumes and prices partially offset by increasing operating, exploration and interest expenses. In 2004, cash flow from operations increased due to higher volumes and prices partially offset by increasing operating costs. Net cash used in investing activities in 2006 was $911.7 million, compared with $432.4 million in 2005 and $624.3 million in 2004. In 2006, we spent $502.9 million in additions to oil and gas properties and $360.1 million on acquisitions. The 2005 period included $276.9 million in additions to oil and gas properties and $153.6 million of acquisitions. The 2004 period included $166.6 million in additions to oil and gas properties and $485.6 million of acquisitions. Net cash provided from financing activities in 2006 was $429.4 million compared with $93.0 million in 2005 and $432.8 million in 2004. Historically, sources of financing have been primarily bank borrowings and capital raised through equity and debt offerings. During 2006, we received proceeds of $249.5 million from the issuance of our 7.5% Notes. During 2005, we received proceeds of $150.0 million and $109.2 million from the issuance of our 6.375% Notes and a common stock offering. During 2005, the outstanding balance under our bank credit facility declined $154.7 million primarily due to the proceeds received from the 6.375% Notes being applied to our bank debt. During 2004, we received proceeds of $98.1 million and $246.1 million from the issuance of additional 7.375% Notes and two common stock offerings, respectively. During 2004, the outstanding balance under our bank credit facility increased $245.7 million with $70.0 million related to the Great Lakes acquisition and the remaining increase the result of funding other acquisitions. Also in 2004, we redeemed the remaining outstanding 6% Debentures for $11.6 million. Capital Requirements Our primary needs for cash are for exploration, development and acquisition of oil and gas properties, repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt and payment of dividends. During 2006, $502.9 million of capital was expended on drilling projects. Also in 2006, $360.1 million was expended on acquisitions primarily to purchase producing properties. The capital program, excluding acquisitions, was funded by net cash flow from operations and borrowings under our credit facility and our acquisitions were funded primarily with proceeds received from the issuance of our 7.5% Notes and borrowings under our credit facility. The 2007 capital budget of $698.0 million, excluding acquisitions, is expected to be funded by cash flow from operations and asset sales. In February 2007, we sold the Austin Chalk properties for proceeds of $80.4 million. Development and exploration activities are highly discretionary, and, for the foreseeable future, we expect such activities to be maintained at levels equal to internal cash flow and asset sales. To the extent capital requirements exceed internal cash flow and proceeds from asset sales, debt or equity may be issued to fund these requirements. The Stroud acquisition included the issuance of 6.5 million shares and the assumption of $106.7 million of debt. We currently believe we have sufficient liquidity and cash flow to meet our obligations for the next twelve months; however, a drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production or reserves could adversely affect our ability to fund capital expenditures and meet our financial obligations. Also, our obligations may change due to acquisitions, divestitures and continued growth. We may issue additional shares of stock, subordinated notes or other debt securities to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, extend maturities or to repay debt. Cash Dividend Payments The amount of future dividends is subject to declaration by the board of directors and depends on earnings, capital expenditures and various other factors, such as restrictions under our bank debt and our subordinated notes. In 2006, we paid $12.2 million in dividends to our common shareholders ($0.03 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.02 per share in the third, second and first quarters). In 2005, we paid $7.6 million in dividends to our common stockholders ($0.02 per share in the fourth quarter and $0.0133 per share in the third, second and first quarters). In 2004, we paid $3.2 million in dividends to our common stockholders ($0.0067 per share in the second and third quarters and $0.0133 per share in the fourth quarter). Also in 2005 and 2004, we paid $2.2 million and $2.9 million in preferred stock dividends. Future Commitments In addition to our capital expenditure program, we are committed to making cash payments in the future on two types of contracts: note agreements and operating leases. As of December 31, 2006, we do not have any capital leases nor have we entered into any material long term contracts for equipment. As of December 31, 2006, we do not have any off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and we have not guaranteed the debt of any other party. The table below provides estimates of the timing of future payments that we are obligated to make based on agreements in place at December 31, 2006. In addition to the contractual obligations listed on the table below, our balance sheet at December 31, 2006 reflects accrued interest payable on our bank debt of $925,000 which is payable in January 2007. We expect to make 31 Table of Contents annual interest payments of $14.8 million per year on our 7.375% Notes, $18.8 million per year on our 7.5% Notes and payments of $9.6 million per year on our 6.375% Notes. The following summarizes our contractual financial obligations at December 31, 2006 and their future maturities. We expect to fund these contractual obligations with cash generated from operating activities, borrowings under the bank credit facility and proceeds from asset sales proceeds. Payment due by period 2008 and 2010 and 2007 2009 2011 Thereafter Total (in thousands) Bank debt due 2011 $ $ $ 452,000 (a) $ $ 452,000 7.375% senior subordinated notes due 2013 200,000 200,000 6.375% senior subordinated notes due 2015 150,000 150,000 7.5% senior subordinated notes due 2016 250,000 250,000 Operating leases 5,010 10,236 6,431 9,610 31,287 Drilling contracts 12,830 2,160 14,990 Service contracts 1,794 3,705 2,754 8,253 Derivative obligations (b) 4,621 266 4,887 Asset retirement obligation liability 4,193 8,674 8,423 74,298 95,588 Total contractual obligations (c) $ 28,448 $ 25,041 $ 469,608 $ 683,908 $ 1,207,005 (a) Due at termination date of our bank credit facility, which we expect to renew, but there is no assurance that can be accomplished. Interest paid on our bank credit facility would be approximately $28.9 million each year assuming no change in the interest rate or outstanding balance. (b) Derivative obligations represent net open derivative contracts valued as of December 31, 2006. (c) This table does not include the liability for the deferred compensation plans since these obligations will be funded with existing plan assets. Hedging Oil and Gas Prices We enter into derivative agreements to reduce the impact of oil and gas price volatility on our operations. At December 31, 2006, swaps were in place covering 73.6 Bcf of gas at prices averaging $9.29 per mcf. We also had collars covering 56.1 Bcf of gas at weighted average floor and cap prices of $7.42 to $10.49 and 4.5 million barrels of oil at weighted average floor and cap prices of $55.72 to $70.11. The derivative fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized or payable on termination, based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX, approximated a pretax gain of $149.8 million at December 31, 2006. The contracts expire monthly through December 2008. Transaction gains and losses are determined monthly and are included as increases or decreases on oil and gas revenue in the period the hedged production is sold. Realized hedging losses of $46.5 million were recognized in 2006 compared to losses of $171.1 million in 2005 and losses of $100.1 million in 2004. Changes in the value of the ineffective portion of all open hedges are recognized in earnings quarterly in other revenue. Unrealized effective gains and losses on hedging positions are recorded at an estimate of fair value based on a comparison of the contract price and a reference price, generally NYMEX, on our consolidated balance sheet as other comprehensive income (OCI) a component of stockholders equity. As of the fourth quarter of 2005, certain of our gas hedges no longer qualify for hedge accounting due to the effect of volatility of gas prices in the fourth quarter of 2005 and on the correlation between realized prices and hedge reference prices. These derivatives were marked to market in the amount of a gain of $10.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 and as a gain of $86.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006. 32 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding: Period Contract Type Volume Hedged Average Hedge Price Natural Gas 2007 Swaps 96,336 Mmbtu/day $9.13 2007 Collars 98,500 Mmbtu/day $7.13 $9.99 2008 Swaps 105,000 Mmbtu/day $9.42 2008 Collars 55,000 Mmbtu/day $7.93 $11.39 Crude Oil 2007 Collars 6,300 bbl/day $53.46 $65.33 2008 Collars 6,000 bbl/day $58.09 $75.11 Interest Rates At December 31, 2006, we had $1.0 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $600.0 million bears interest at fixed rates averaging 7.2%. Bank debt totaling $452.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 6.4% at year end 2006. The 30 day LIBOR rate on December 31, 2006 was 5.3%. A 1% increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2006 would cost us approximately $4.5 million in additional annual interest. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not currently utilize any off balance sheet arrangements to enhance liquidity and capital resource position, or for any other purpose. Inflation and Changes in Prices Our revenues, the value of our assets and our ability to obtain bank loans or additional capital on attractive terms have been and will continue to be affected by changes in oil and gas prices and the costs to produce our reserves. Oil and gas prices are subject to significant fluctuations that are beyond our ability to control or predict. Although certain of our costs and expenses are affected by general inflation, inflation does not normally have a significant effect on our business. In a trend that began in 2004 and accelerated during 2005 and 2006, commodity prices for oil and gas increased significantly. The higher prices have led to increased activity in the industry and, consequently, rising costs. These costs trends have put pressure not only on our operating costs but also on our capital costs. We expect further increases in these costs for 2007. 33 Table of Contents The following table indicates the average oil and gas prices received over the last five years and quarterly for 2006, 2005 and 2004.

The preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at year end and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the year. We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable; however, actual results may differ. Certain accounting estimates are considered to be critical if (a) the nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to changes; and (b) the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material. Oil and Gas Properties Proved reserves are defined by the SEC as those volumes of crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids and natural gas that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty are recoverable from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions. Proved developed reserves are volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Although our engineers are knowledgeable of and follow the guidelines for reserves established by the SEC, the estimation of reserves requires engineers to make a significant number of assumptions based on professional judgment. Reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information. Estimated reserves are often subject to future revisions, which could be substantial, based on the availability of additional information, including: reservoir performance, new geological and geophysical data, additional drilling, technological advancements, price and cost changes and other economic factors. Changes in oil and gas prices can lead to a decision to start up or shut in production, which can lead to revisions to reserve quantities. Reserve revisions in turn cause adjustments in the depletion rates utilized by us. We cannot predict what reserve revisions may be required in future periods. Reserve estimates are reviewed and approved by our Vice President of Reservoir Engineering who reports directly to our Chief Operating Officer. To further ensure the reliability of our reserve estimates, we engage independent petroleum consultants to review our estimates of proved reserves. Historical variances between our reserve estimates and the aggregate estimates of our consultants have been less than 5%. The following table sets forth a summary of the percent of reserves which were reviewed by independent petroleum consultants for each of the years ended 2006, 2005 and 2004. Audited(a) 2006 2005 2004 87% 84 % 88 % (a) Audited reserves are those reserves estimated by our employees and reviewed by an independent petroleum consultant. We utilize the successful efforts method to account for exploration and development expenditures. Unsuccessful exploration drilling costs are expensed and can have a significant effect on reported operating results. Successful exploration drilling costs and all development costs are capitalized and systematically charged to expense using the units of production method based on proved developed oil and gas reserves as estimated by our engineers and reviewed by independent engineers. Costs incurred for exploratory wells that find reserves that cannot yet be classified as proved are capitalized on our balance sheet if (a) the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and (b) we are making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. Otherwise, well costs are expensed if a determination as to whether proved reserves were found cannot be made within one year following completion of drilling and these criteria are not met. Proven property leasehold costs are charged to expense using the units of production method based on total proved reserves. Unproved properties are assessed periodically (at least annually) and impairments to value are charged to expense. The successful efforts method inherently relies upon the estimation of proved reserves, which includes proved developed and proved undeveloped volumes. We adhere to the Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 19, Financial Accounting and Reporting by Oil and Gas Producing Companies, for recognizing any impairment of capitalized costs to unproved properties. The greatest portion of these costs generally relate to the acquisition of leasehold costs. The costs are capitalized and periodically evaluated (at least annually) as to recoverability, based on changes brought about by economic factors and potential shifts in 35 Table of Contents business strategy employed by management. We consider a combination of time, geologic and engineering factors to evaluate the need for impairment of these costs. Unproved properties had a net book value of $226.3 million in 2006 compared to $28.6 million in 2005 and $14.8 million in 2004. Depletion rates are determined based on reserve quantity estimates and the capitalized costs of producing properties. As the estimated reserves are adjusted, the depletion expense for a property will change, assuming no change in production volumes or the capitalized costs. Estimated reserves are used as the basis for calculating the expected future cash flows from a property, which are used to determine whether that property may be impaired. Reserves are also used to estimate the supplemental disclosure of the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to oil and gas producing activities and reserve quantities in Note 19, Supplemental Information on Natural Gas and Oil Exploration, Development and Production Activities to our consolidated financial statements. Changes in the estimated reserves are considered in estimates for accounting purposes and are reflected on a prospective basis. We monitor our long lived assets recorded in property, plant and equipment in our consolidated balance sheet to ensure they are fairly presented. We must evaluate our properties for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset could exceed its fair value. A significant amount of judgment is involved in performing these evaluations since the results are based on estimated future events. Such events include a projection of future oil and natural gas sales prices, an estimate of the ultimate amount of recoverable oil and gas reserves that will be produced from a field, the timing of future production, future production costs, future abandonment costs, and future inflation. The need to test a property for impairment can be based on several factors, including a significant reduction in sales prices for oil and or gas, unfavorable adjustment to reserves, physical damage to production equipment and facilities, a change in costs, or other changes to contracts, environmental regulations or tax laws. All of these factors must be considered when testing a propertys carrying value for impairment. We cannot predict whether impairment charges may be required in the future. We are required to develop estimates of fair value to allocate purchase prices paid to acquire businesses to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed under the purchase method of accounting. The purchase price paid to acquire a business is allocated to its assets and liabilities based on the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the date of acquisition. We use all available information to make these fair value determinations. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for information on these acquisitions. Derivatives We use commodity derivative contracts to manage our exposure to oil and gas price volatility. We account for our commodity derivatives in accordance with SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. For derivative contracts designated as hedges, earnings are affected by the ineffective portion of a hedge contract (changes in realized prices that do not match the changes in the hedge price). Ineffective gains or losses are recorded in other revenue while the hedge contract is open and may increase or reverse until settlement of the contract. This may result in significant volatility to current period income. For derivatives qualifying as hedges, the effective portion of any changes in fair value is recognized in stockholders equity as other comprehensive income (OCI), and then reclassified to earnings, in oil and gas revenue, when the hedged transaction is consummated. This may result in significant volatility in stockholders equity. The fair value of open hedging contracts is an estimated amount that could be realized upon termination. As of the fourth quarter of 2005, certain of our gas hedges no longer qualify for hedge accounting due to the volatility of gas prices and their effect on our basis differentials and are marked to market. The commodity derivatives we use include commodity collars and swaps. While there is a risk that the financial benefit of rising prices may not be captured, we believe the benefits of stable and predictable cash flow are more important. Among these benefits are a more efficient utilization of existing personnel and planning for future staff additions, the flexibility to enter into long term projects requiring substantial committed capital, smoother and more efficient execution of our ongoing development drilling and production enhancement programs, more consistent returns on invested capital, and better access to bank and other credit markets. Asset Retirement Obligations We have significant obligations to remove tangible equipment and restore land or seabed at the end of oil and gas production operations. Removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells and removing and disposing of offshore oil and gas platforms. Estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires us to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal. Asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing, as are regulatory, political, environmental, safety and public relations considerations. 36 Table of Contents Inherent in the fair value calculation are numerous assumptions and judgments including the ultimate retirement costs, inflation factors, credit adjusted discount rates, timing of retirement, and changes in the legal, regulatory, environmental and political environments. To the extent future revisions to these assumptions impact the present value of the existing asset retirement obligation, (ARO), a corresponding adjustment is made to the oil and gas property balance. In addition, increases in the discounted ARO liability resulting from the passage of time are reflected as accretion expense, a component of depletion, depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statement of operations. Deferred Taxes We are subject to income and other taxes in all areas in which we operate. When recording income tax expense, certain estimates are required because income tax returns are generally filed many months after the close of a calendar year, tax returns are subject to audit which can take years to complete and future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized. We have deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences. We routinely evaluate deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization. A valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when we believe that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized. In determining deferred tax liabilities, accounting rules require OCI to be considered, even though such income or loss has not yet been earned. At year end 2005, deferred tax liabilities exceeded deferred tax assets by $113.1 million, with $85.5 million of deferred tax assets related to unrealized deferred hedging losses included in OCI. At year end 2006, deferred tax liabilities exceeded deferred tax assets by $468.6 million, with $21.3 million of deferred tax liabilities related to unrealized hedging gains included in OCI. We may be challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in our various income tax returns. Although we believe that we have adequately provided for all taxes, gains or losses could occur in the future due to changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding tax matters. Contingent Liabilities A provision for legal, environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost or range of cost can be reasonably estimated. Judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal, environmental and contingent matters. In addition, we often must estimate the amount of such losses. In many cases, our judgment is based on the input of our legal advisors and on the interpretation of laws and regulations, which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or the courts. We monitor known and potential legal, environmental and other contingent matters and make our best estimate of when to record losses for these matters based on available information. Although we continue to monitor all contingencies closely, particularly our outstanding litigation, we currently have no material accruals for contingent liabilities. Accounting Standards Not Yet Adopted In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This statement defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS No. 157 does not require any new fair value measurements but may require some entities to change their measurement practices. For Range, SFAS No. 157 will be effective January 1, 2008, with early application permitted. We are currently evaluating the provisions of this statement. In July 2006, FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes An Interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 was issued. FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. FIN 48 prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. The new standard also provides guidance on derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, accounting in interim periods and disclosure. For Range, the provisions of FIN 48 are effective January 1, 2007. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 will be recorded in retained earnings. Range is currently evaluating the provisions of FIN 48 to determine the impact on its consolidated financial statements but we do not expect a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. 37 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks. The term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in oil and gas prices and interest rates. The disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses, but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses. This forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposure. All of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than trading. All accounts are US dollar denominated. Market Risk Our major market risk is exposure to oil and gas prices. Realized prices are primarily driven by worldwide prices for oil and spot market prices for North American gas production. Oil and gas prices have been volatile and unpredictable for many years. Commodity Price Risk We periodically enter into derivative arrangements with respect to our oil and gas production. These arrangements are intended to reduce the impact of oil and gas price fluctuations. Certain of our derivatives are swaps where we receive a fixed price for our production and pay market prices to the counterparty. Our derivatives program also includes collars which assume a minimum floor price and a predetermined ceiling price. The majority of our derivatives qualify as accounting hedges. In times of increasing price volatility, we may experience losses from our hedging arrangements and increased basis differentials at the delivery points where we market our production. Widening basis differentials occur when the physical delivery market prices do not increase proportionately to the increased prices in the financial trading markets. Realized gains and losses are recognized in oil and gas revenues when the associated production occurs. Gains or losses on open contracts are recorded either in current period income or other comprehensive income. Generally, derivative losses occur when market prices increase, which are offset by gains on the underlying physical commodity transaction. Conversely, derivative gains occur when market prices decrease, which are offset by losses on the underlying commodity transaction. Ineffective gains and losses are recognized in earnings as a component of other revenue. We do not enter into derivative instruments for trading purposes. Though not all of our derivatives qualify as accounting hedges, the purpose of entering into the contracts is to economically hedge oil and gas prices. Those that do not qualify as accounting hedges are marked to market through earnings. As of December 31, 2006, we had oil and gas swaps in place covering 73.6 Bcf of gas. We also had collars covering 56.1 Bcf of gas and 4.5 million barrels of oil. These contracts expire monthly through December 2008. The fair value, represented by the estimated amount that would be realized upon immediate liquidation as of December 31, 2006, approximated a net pre tax gain of $149.8 million. Gains or losses realized on hedging transactions are determined monthly based upon the difference between contract price received by us for the sale of our hedged production and the hedge price, generally closing prices on the NYMEX. These gains and losses are included as increases or decreases to oil and gas revenues in the period the hedged production is sold. In 2006, pre tax losses were realized in the amount of $46.5 million compared to losses of $171.1 million in 2005 and losses of $100.1 million in 2004. Gains and losses due to commodity hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings in other revenues in our consolidated statement of operations. The ineffective portion of hedges that qualified for hedge accounting was a gain of $6.0 million in 2006 compared to a loss of $3.4 million in 2005 and a gain of $712,000 in 2004. Other Commodity Risk We are impacted by basis risk, caused by factors that affect the relationship between commodity futures prices reflected in derivative commodity instruments and the cash market price of the underlying commodity. Natural gas transaction prices are frequently based on industry reference prices that may vary from prices experienced in local markets. If commodity prices changes in one region are not reflected in other regions, derivative commodity instruments may no longer provide the expected hedge, resulting in increased basis risk. As of the fourth quarter of 2005, certain of our gas hedges no longer qualify for hedge accounting due to the volatility in gas prices and its effect on our basis differentials and are marked to market. This resulted in a gain of $10.9 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 compared to a gain of $86.5 million in the year ended December 31, 2006 in the income statement category called mark to market on oil and gas derivatives. 38 Table of Contents At December 31, 2006, the following commodity derivative contracts were outstanding: Period Contract Type Volume Hedged Average Hedge Price Natural Gas 2007 Swaps 96,336 Mmbtu/day $9.13 2007 Collars 98,500 Mmbtu/day $7.13 $9.99 2008 Swaps 105,000 Mmbtu/day $9.42 2008 Collars 55,000 Mmbtu/day $7.93 $11.39 Crude Oil 2007 Collars 6,300 bbl/day $53.46 $65.33 2008 Collars 6,000 bbl/day $58.09 $75.11 In 2006, a 10% reduction in oil and gas prices, excluding amounts fixed through hedging transactions, would have reduced revenue by $73.4 million. If oil and gas futures prices at December 31, 2006 had declined by 10%, the unrealized hedging gain at that date would have increased $74.8 million. Interest Rate Risk At December 31, 2006, we had $1.0 billion of debt outstanding. Of this amount, $600.0 million bears interest at a fixed rate averaging 7.2%. Bank debt totaling $452.0 million bears interest at floating rates, which averaged 6.4% on that date. On December 31, 2006, the 30 day LIBOR rate was 5.3%. A 1% increase in short term interest rates on the floating rate debt outstanding at December 31, 2006 would cost us approximately $4.5 million in additional annual interest rates.
