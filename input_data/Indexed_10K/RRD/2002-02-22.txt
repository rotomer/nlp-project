ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Review In the financial review that follows, we discuss our results of operations, financial condition and certain other information. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that begin on page F 1. 11 In November 1999, we disposed of our entire interest in Corporate Software & Technology Inc. (CS&T). The operating results of this business are shown as a discontinued operation. In November 1999, we also sold 93% of our investment in the common stock of Stream International Inc. (Stream). Stream is consolidated in our financial results prior to the date of disposition. For comparison purposes, summary results of operations for Stream are included in the table below: Stream Summary Income Statement* In Millions 2001 2000 1999 Net sales $ $ $ 212 Value added revenue (VAR) 212 Gross profit 64 Selling and administrative expenses 57 Earnings from operations 7 * Included in Other for segment reporting purposes. One Time Items The following nonrecurring items also affect comparability between years: In 2001, income from continuing operations included: restructuring and impairment charges ($196 million pretax and $137 million after tax; $(1.15) per diluted share); a gain on the sale of our remaining 7% interest in Stream ($7 million both pretax and after tax; $0.05 per diluted share); and a loss on the write down of several Internet technology related investments of the company ($19 million pretax and after tax; $(0.16) per diluted share). In 2000, income from continuing operations included a one time non operating gain related to the sale of shares received from the demutualization of our basic life insurance carrier ($13 million pretax and $8 million after tax; $0.06 per diluted share). In 1999, income from continuing operations included: a gain on the sale of 93% of our interest in Stream ($40 million pretax and $75 million after tax due to tax benefits from associated tax loss carrybacks; $0.59 per diluted share); a gain on the sale of our interest in Modus Media International (MMI) ($3 million both pretax and after tax; $0.01 per diluted share); and a provision for income taxes related to corporate owned life insurance (COLI) ($51 million; $(0.40) per diluted share) (see the Income Taxes note to the consolidated financial statements on page F 19 for more details on COLI).

Results of Operations 2001 compared with 2000 Net sales decreased $467 million, or 8.1%, to $5.3 billion compared with $5.8 billion in 2000. Acquisitions contributed an increase of $103 million in net sales between years, offset by lower organic sales within the Commercial Print and Logistics Services segments. For our Commercial Print segment, value added revenue represents net sales less the cost of materials. For some customers, we purchase paper used in the printing process and pass through this cost (referred to as pass through material sales) at a margin that is lower than print and related services; other customers furnish their own paper. Customer furnished paper is not reflected in our financial results. For our Logistics Services segment, value added revenue represents net sales less the cost of transportation. By measuring value added revenue, we eliminate the effects of material prices and transportation costs, as well as mix issues related to customer furnished versus Donnelley furnished paper, that are largely beyond our control. Consolidated value added revenue decreased $305 million, or 9.2%, to $3.0 billion compared with $3.3 billion in 2000. Acquisitions contributed an increase of $35 million in value added revenue between years. Value added revenue is affected by the price of scrap (by product) paper we sell. Income from the sale of by products is recorded as a reduction in our cost of materials. During 2001, we recognized a reduction in our cost of materials of $41 million from by product revenues compared with $66 million in 2000, a decrease of 38%. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales declined to 17.2% in 2001 compared with 19.1% in 2000, primarily due to lower margins within the Commercial Print segment. Commercial Prints gross profit margin was affected negatively in 2001 by lower volumes and high fixed costs across most of the segment, primarily within Financial Services and Long run Magazines, Catalogs and Inserts. Our Logistics Services segment, which has a lower gross profit margin than our Commercial Print segment, also represented a higher proportion of net sales in 2001 (15% versus 12% in 2000). Selling and administrative expenses decreased $30 million, or 5.1%, to $568 million compared with $598 million in 2000. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 10.7% in 2001 compared with 10.4% in 2000. Reductions in volume related costs, including incentive compensation and sales commissions, savings resulting from our elimination of approximately 250 administrative positions company wide ($10 million) and general cost containment were partially offset by increased bad debt expense ($16 million). The increase in bad debt expense during 2001 reflected a deterioration in collections during the year, particularly due to retail bankruptcies. Net interest expense decreased 20.6% to $71 million in 2001, due to lower average debt levels, and lower average short term borrowing rates. Other income, net, in 2001 was $11 million compared with $23 million in 2000. Other income, net, in 2000 included a one time pretax gain of $13 million from the sale of shares received from the demutualization of our basic life insurance carrier. Excluding this one time gain in 2000, other income, 13 net, increased $1 million in 2001 primarily due to higher equity income on investments ($4 million) and higher miscellaneous income ($1 million), partially offset by higher foreign currency transaction losses ($4 million). The following comparisons exclude the impact of the one time items discussed below: Earnings from continuing operations before income taxes of $282 million in 2001 decreased 33.0% from $421 million in 2000. The effective tax rate in both years was 38.5%. Net income of $174 million in 2001 decreased 33.0% from $259 million in 2000. Diluted earnings per share of $1.47 decreased $0.64, or 30.3%, from $2.11 in 2000. The rate of decrease was lower on a per share basis due to fewer average shares outstanding during 2001. Including one time items, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were $75 million in 2001, down 82.7% from $434 million in 2000. The effective tax rate in 2001 was 66.6%, compared with 38.5% in 2000, as certain one time items did not have an associated income tax provision or benefit. Net income was $25 million, down 90.6% from $267 million in 2000. The following table shows the trends in net sales and value added revenue by end market (in thousands): Net Sales Value Added Revenue 2001 2000 % Change 2001 2000 % Change Long run Magazines, Catalogs, and Inserts $ 1,670,106 $ 1,873,484 (10.9 )% $ 1,033,906 $ 1,158,297 (10.7 )% Telecommunications 834,366 868,153 (3.9 ) 385,335 406,847 (5.3 ) Book Publishing Services 708,380 780,349 (9.2 ) 502,674 532,693 (5.6 ) Financial Services 493,563 638,129 (22.7 ) 416,045 540,382 (23.0 ) International(1) 293,069 326,773 (10.3 ) 141,852 156,682 (9.5 ) Specialized Publishing Services 228,080 263,492 (13.4 ) 141,792 158,972 (10.8 ) RRD Direct 179,330 198,111 (9.5 ) 98,943 107,146 (7.7 ) Premedia Technologies 105,749 109,909 (3.8 ) 105,749 108,069 (2.1 ) Total Commercial Print $ 4,512,643 $ 5,058,400 (10.8 ) $ 2,826,296 $ 3,169,088 (10.8 ) Logistics Services 775,518 691,167 12.2 168,130 122,828 36.9 Other(2) 9,599 14,768 (35.0 ) 6,063 13,402 (54.8 ) Total Net Sales $ 5,297,760 $ 5,764,335 (8.1 ) $ 3,000,489 $ 3,305,318 (9.2 ) (1) Includes Latin America and Poland.

Operating Results by Business Segment 2001 Compared with 2000 As discussed more fully in the Industry Segment Information note to the consolidated financial statements on page F 25, we have two reportable segments: Commercial Print and Logistics Services. Following our acquisition of CTC in February 2000, we now report results from our logistics businesses within Logistics Services. Refer to the section End Market Descriptions on page 3 for a discussion of the end markets served by each of these business segments. Net sales of our Commercial Print segment decreased $546 million in 2001, or 10.8%, from 2000. The incremental impact of acquisitions on net sales between years was not significant. First half net sales of the Commercial Print segment were down 8.2% between years. The impact of the economic slowdown worsened in the second half of 2001 particularly after September 11; second half net sales decreased by 13.2% between years. Net sales for Long run Magazines, Catalogs and Inserts decreased 10.9% between years, which reflected volume decreases across all major markets. Increased retail bankruptcies, as well as lower magazine and retail insert advertising spending, and lower catalog page counts drove the majority of volume declines. Net sales for Book Publishing were down 9.2% from 2000 driven by lower volumes in the consumer and religious markets. Net sales for Telecommunications decreased 3.9% between years primarily due to volume shortfalls in the domestic directory market. 14 Net sales for Financial Services decreased 22.7% compared with 2000, driven primarily by the slowdown in both U.S. and international capital markets. Capital markets volume was particularly impacted by the events and aftermath of September 11. During 2001, we derived 85.0% of our capital markets sales from the U.S.; our U.S. capital markets sales were down 20.9% from 2000. Due to weakness in the international capital markets during 2001, our international capital markets sales were down 58.6% from 2000. Net sales of our Logistics Services segment increased $84 million in 2001, or 12.2%, from 2000. We acquired package logistics in February 2000, which contributed an incremental $104 million in net sales between years. Unit volumes for package logistics were up 21.4% between years, partially due to an additional five weeks of activity in 2001. In addition, package logistics benefited from higher pricing in 2001, including a more profitable customer mix. Net sales of our print logistics business were down 6.0% between years, driven primarily by lower freight services volume and, to a lesser extent, reduced expedited services volume. Value added revenue for the Commercial Print segment decreased $343 million, or 10.8%, from 2000, resulting from volume declines across all major markets. The incremental impact of acquisitions on value added revenue between years was not significant. Value added revenue for Long run Magazines, Catalogs and Inserts declined 10.8% between years, driven primarily by lower volumes. Lower revenues from by products for Long run Magazines, Catalogs and Inserts decreased value added revenue by 1.0% between years. Financial Services value added revenue decreased 23.0% from 2000, driven by the slowed U.S. and international capital markets. Value added revenue for the Logistics Services segment increased $45 million, or 36.9%, from 2000. Package logistics contributed an incremental $35 million in value added revenue between years, up 59.1%. During 2000, package logistics was affected negatively by low price levels in response to competition and low margin work for a number of large mailers. In 2001, package logistics benefited from higher net sales, and higher postage discounts due to deeper penetration of the postal system (closer to the final destination), which more than offset increased transportation and handling costs. Value added revenue for our print logistics business increased 16.3% from 2000, despite the drop in net sales between years, driven by lower transportation costs. The decline in transportation costs related to better cost management and non recurring start up costs of a new distribution facility in the Northeast during the fourth quarter of 2000. The following discussion excludes the impact of restructuring and impairment charges (see discussion under the caption Restructuring and Impairment and Other One Time Items, below). Earnings from operations for the Commercial Print segment declined $207 million, or 39.8%, from 2000, with declines in each end market. Earnings from operations within Long run Magazines, Catalogs and Inserts in particular were hurt by the severity of the volume decline, particularly during the second half of 2001. During 2001, we announced actions to better align our cost structures that included the closing of four print facilities within our long run operations. Of the four facilities, the two largest (Des Moines, Iowa and Old Saybrook, Connecticut) are expected to cease operations in the second quarter of 2002. Earnings from operations within Financial Services were affected negatively in 2001 by the capital markets slowdown. RRD Direct had volume shortfalls during 2001 and operational issues at its Newark, Ohio facility, following the consolidation of another direct mail facility into Newark in 2000. Earnings from operations in 2000 included a pretax charge of $9 million to close two plants (a direct mail facility and a Financial Services printing plant). Our Logistics Services segment incurred a loss from operations, excluding restructuring and impairment charges, of $3.9 million compared with a loss of $13.9 million in 2000. This improved operating performance in 2001 was driven by package logistics, and the positive factors affecting value added revenue noted above. Logistics Services also benefited from reduced administrative expenses in 2001 related to the shutdown of package logistics former headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota during the year. Our print logistics business incurred a loss from operations in 2001, driven by lower freight services volume, as well as lower expedited services volume related to the declines in Financial Services. Within print logistics, the distribution center start up problems in the fourth quarter of 2000 were resolved in early 2001, partially offset by additional facility expansion costs during 2001. 15 The loss from operations within the Other segment, excluding restructuring and impairment charges, included expenses of $21 million and $29 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, to grow complementary businesses. These businesses included Red Rover Digital (Red Rover), a provider of Internet web site design services, which was shut down during the fourth quarter of 2001. 2000 included an additional operating loss of $2 million for our Louisville distribution center through June 2000, the date of disposition. Earnings from operations for the Corporate segment, excluding restructuring and impairment charges, were $55 million in 2001 compared with $26 million in 2000. This increase between years was driven by higher benefit plan earnings (excluding service costs) ($9 million); lower provision for LIFO inventories ($4 million) and lower corporate administrative and other unallocated expenses ($16 million). Earnings (loss) from operations as reported (including restructuring and impairment charges) is reconciled to earnings (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes by business segment as follows: Commercial Print: other income, net, of $14 million in 2001 and $13 million in 2000; Logistics Services: other income, net, of $0.3 million in 2001 and other expense, net, of $0.1 million in 2000; Other: other expense, net, of $13 million in 2001 and $4 million in 2000; and Corporate: other expense, net, of $74 million in 2001 and $76 million in 2000. Other income, net, for the Commercial Print segment in 2001 included a pretax loss of $5 million related to the impact of the peso devaluation on our investment in Argentina. The functional currency of our operations in Argentina is the Argentine peso. While the devaluation was formally announced in January 2002, the currency impact of translating non peso denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars was recorded in 2001. The $5 million pretax loss was more than offset by additional miscellaneous other income. Other expense, net, within the Other segment of $13 million in 2001 included $12 million of net one time gains and losses related to the following investments: $19 million pretax loss on the write down of several Internet technology related investments, partially reduced by a $7 million one time gain on the sale of our remaining investment in Stream (see discussion under the caption Restructuring and Impairment and Other One Time Items, below). Other expense, net, within the Corporate segment in 2001 included lower net interest expense between years of $17 million, partially offset by lower gains on sale of assets ($5 million) and higher miscellaneous other expense ($10 million). Restructuring and Impairment and Other One Time Items The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the Restructuring and Impairment note to the consolidated financial statements on Page F 9. During 2001, we recorded pretax restructuring and impairment charges of $196 million ($137 million after tax, or $1.15 per diluted share). Of the total $196 million pretax charge, $106 million related to various restructuring actions announced during 2001, and $90 million related to write downs to adjust the carrying values of certain businesses. The total $196 million pretax charge was included as restructuring and impairment charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income on page F 2. As a company, we assess regularly our manufacturing platforms to assure that they are efficient, flexible and aligned properly with our customers needs. In March 2001, we announced a $300 million upgrade in our print platform, approximately one third of which related to restructuring costs. We intend to create a more efficient, flexible and integrated print platform to better serve our long run magazine, catalog and inserts customers within our Commercial Print segment. This upgrade program includes the purchase of up to ten new presses and associated binding lines, most of which we expect to place into service during 2002. As we upgrade facilities, certain existing equipment with minimal book value will be either retired or sold. As of December 31, 2001, capital expenditures related to this upgrade program were $90 million, mostly in the fourth quarter. We plan to complete the upgrade program by early to mid 2003. We expect total company capital spending for the full year 2002, including the upgrade program, to be in the range of $250 million to $300 million, consistent with 2001 levels. 16 As part of our efforts to build a more effective print platform, we must continually assess each plants scale of operations and geographic location relative to our entire print platform. During the first half of 2001, we announced the closure of the following five U.S. manufacturing facilities: St. Petersburg and South Daytona, Florida; Des Moines, Iowa; Old Saybrook, Connecticut; and print production only at a Financial Services sales center in Houston, Texas. Each of these print facilities lacked the necessary scale and geographic location to remain competitive. All customer work produced at these facilities either has been or will be transferred to other company facilities once necessary expansions to accommodate the transfer of work are complete. As of December 31, 2001, all print production had ceased at the two Florida and the Texas facilities. Both Florida facilities are considered held for disposal at December 31, 2001. Print production at the Des Moines, Iowa and Old Saybrook, Connecticut facilities (the two largest of the announced closings) is expected to cease by June 30, 2002. The Des Moines, Iowa and Old Saybrook, Connecticut facilities are considered held for use as of December 31, 2001. In addition to the above restructuring actions, we announced additional workforce reductions and consolidations at several of our facilities during 2001, including a company wide reduction of 250 administrative positions in June. In particular, we took further actions to reduce costs in the second half because of the duration and severity of the economic downturn and its impact on all of our print related businesses. Total pretax restructuring and impairment charges of $106 million related to restructuring actions announced during 2001 by business segment were: Commercial Print: $96 million; Logistics Services: $1 million; Other: $5 million; and Corporate: $4 million. Of these amounts, $89 million represented the cash component, of which $55 million was paid during 2001. Of the $55 million cash component, $19 million represented enhanced early retirement benefits to be paid by our various benefit plans. As noted above, we plan to complete our print platform upgrade program primarily in 2002, with some carryover into 2003 expected. As we complete our upgrade program and fully transition all customer work during the first half of 2002 from closed facilities, we expect to improve the overall performance of our print platform. This will include improvements in cycle times and less waste through the addition of faster, more efficient equipment to our networked platform. Further, we expect to achieve greater economies of scale when volume levels return from the depressed economic levels in 2001 by having fewer, yet larger and more strategically located facilities. These improvements will be augmented by our business process redesign and continuous improvement programs (such as Six Sigma and Process Variability Reduction) that we expect will continue to drive down both manufacturing costs and working capital. In addition to the five U.S. manufacturing locations, we announced the closing during 2001 of two plants outside the U.S. due to sales shortfalls from acquisition plans and to streamline costs: Ediciones Eclipse S.A. de C.V. in Mexico, and Hamburg Gr&aacute;fica Editora in Brazil. Customer work from both plants will be consolidated into existing company facilities. In addition, in 2001, we ceased production of directories at our York, England facility, and transitioned the work to a newly constructed plant in Flaxby, England. All three non U.S. facilities were considered held for disposal at December 31, 2001. During 2001, in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, we recorded a pretax impairment charge of $90 million to adjust the carrying values of certain of our businesses to fair value. This included write downs with respect to the following businesses within the Commercial Print segment: RRD Direct (Communicolor, Newark, Ohio division: $37 million); Specialized Publishing Services (Penton Press, Berea, Ohio division: $11 million); and International including Argentina (Atl&aacute;ntida Cochrane: $19 million); Brazil (Circulo do Livro and Hamburg Gr&aacute;fica Editora: $11 million); and Mexico (Ediciones Eclipse S.A. de C.V.: $12 million). The pretax impairment charge of $90 million reduced goodwill by $36 million and property and equipment by $54 million. The write downs were primarily the result of the deterioration in net sales from the original acquisition plans, such that the carrying values of the entities were not considered to be recoverable. See the Restructuring and Impairment note to the consolidated financial statements on page F 9 for more details. 17 As a result of all restructuring actions and impairment write downs announced in 2001, net of the incremental costs associated with the print platform upgrade, we expect to realize costs savings in 2002 of approximately $90 million, of which $86 million is the cash component and $4 million is non cash, related to lower depreciation expense. During 2001, we recognized approximately $19 million of cost savings from 2001 restructuring actions taken, excluding benefits from our continuous improvement and other productivity programs. Of this $19 million in cost savings, $18 million was the cash component, and $1 million was non cash, related to lower depreciation expense. This reduction in our cost structure, however, was more than offset by the impact of volume reductions and pricing pressures in 2001, particularly during the second half of the year. As long as market activity levels remain low, we will continue to take aggressive cost actions. We also expect to drive gains in throughput, productivity and capacity utilization once volume activity levels recover. During 2001, we recorded a pretax charge of $19 million ($19 million after tax, or $0.16 per diluted share) to write down the values of several of our Internet related technology investments. During 2000, we acquired a minority interest in an Internet communications services company for $14 million for which no publicly traded market data was available. During the fourth quarter of 2001, this Internet communications services company entered into an equity transaction with a third party, which provided a basis for a revised valuation and an impairment of our minority interest. The total $19 million pretax charge was included in other income (expense) as investment write downs in the Consolidated Statements of Income on page F 2. We also recorded a pretax gain on the sale of our remaining interest in Stream in the fourth quarter of 2001 of $7 million ($7 million after tax, or $0.05 per share). The $7 million pretax gain was included in other income (expense) as gain on sale of businesses and investments in the Consolidated Statements of Income on page F 2. In 2000, we recorded a pretax gain of $13 million ($8 million after tax, or $0.06 per diluted share) on the sale of shares received from the demutualization of our basic life insurance carrier. The $13 million pretax gain was included in other income (expense) as other, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income on page F 2. Results of Operations 2000 compared with 1999 Continuing Operations Net sales increased $349 million, or 6.4%, to $5.8 billion compared with $5.4 billion in 1999. Excluding Stream, net sales increased $561 million, or 10.8%, from 1999. Acquisitions contributed $476 million of the increase in net sales excluding Stream between years. Our most significant acquisition during 2000 was the purchase of certain net assets of CTC in February. CTC, or package logistics, which is reported as part of our Logistics Services segment, contributed $365 million of net sales in 2000. Consolidated value added revenue was flat between years; excluding Stream, value added revenue increased $210 million, or 6.8%, to $3.3 billion compared with $3.1 billion in 1999. Acquisitions contributed $136 million of the increase in value added revenue between years. Value added revenue is affected by the price of scrap (by product) paper we sell. Income from the sale of by products is recorded as a reduction in our cost of materials. During 2000, we recognized a reduction in our cost of materials of $66 million from by product revenues, which represents an increase of $28 million, or 71.5%, from 1999. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 19.1% in 2000 compared with 21.4% in 1999. Excluding Stream, our gross profit margin in 1999 was 21.0%. Our Logistics Services segment, which has lower gross profit margins than our Commercial Print segment, represented a higher proportion of net sales in 2000 (12% versus 5% in 1999), primarily as a result of the acquisition of package logistics. Logistics Services gross margin was down significantly in 2000 related to the performance of package logistics, as well as higher transportation costs and other operational issues discussed below. Commercial Prints gross profit margin increased between years due to the impact of continued productivity initiatives and higher by products revenues. Selling and administrative expenses decreased $31 million, or 4.9%, to $598 million compared with $629 million in 1999. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 10.4% in 2000 compared with 11.6% in 1999. Spending reductions and cost containment of $10 million, coupled with the elimination of 18 Stream expenses ($57 million) and lower Year 2000 related expenses ($30 million), were partially offset by increased spending to grow new complementary businesses ($23 million), information systems development ($21 million) and recent acquisitions ($22 million). Net interest expense increased 1.7% to $90 million in 2000, due to higher average short term borrowing rates. Other income, net, in 2000 of $23 million included a one time pretax gain of $13 million from the sale of shares received from the demutualization of our basic life insurance carrier. Excluding one time items, other income, net, decreased $12 million between years primarily due to lower equity income on investments ($7 million) and foreign currency transaction losses ($5 million). Gain on sale of businesses and investments of $43 million in 1999 included one time pretax gains on the disposition of Stream ($40 million) and the sale of our interest in MMI ($3 million). The following comparisons exclude the impact of one time items and Stream. Income from continuing operations before income taxes of $421 million decreased 8.0% from 1999. The effective tax rate in both years was 38.5%. Income from continuing operations per diluted share of $2.11 decreased $0.06, or 2.8%, from 1999. The rate of decrease was lower on a per share basis due to fewer average shares outstanding during 2000. Including one time items and Stream, income from continuing operations and related diluted earnings per share decreased 14.3% and 9.6%, respectively, from 1999. Discontinued Operations Operating results of CS&T were classified as a discontinued operation as of the date of disposal (November 1999), with prior periods restated. In 1999, the pretax loss from this segment was $5 million, or $3 million after tax ($0.02 per diluted share). There was no gain or loss on sale. Consolidated Net Income Excluding one time items and Stream, net income of $259 million in 2000 decreased 7.0% from $279 million in 1999, while diluted earnings per share decreased 1.9% to $2.11. The rate of decrease was lower on a per share basis due to fewer average shares outstanding during 2000. Including one time items and Stream, net income decreased 13.4% while diluted earnings per share decreased 8.8%.

(2) Includes Red Rover, Louisville Distribution (sold in June 2000) and Other. Operating Results by Business Segment 2000 Compared with 1999 Net sales of our Commercial Print segment increased $154 million in 2000, or 3.1%, from 1999. Net sales for Long run Magazines, Catalogs and Inserts were up less than 1% from 1999, which reflected strong volume increases and higher paper prices in 2000, offset by a lower volume of pass through material sales. Paper prices for major grades of paper employed by our long run market increased an average of 5% between years. Net sales for Telecommunications were flat to 19 1999, as an increase in directory volumes was offset by a reduction in nondirectory work (for example, the platform produced work for Financial Services in 1999). Net sales for Book Publishing were flat to 1999, driven by higher volumes within the consumer and educational markets, offset by lower pass through material sales. Net sales for Financial Services were up 1.0% in 2000, driven by increased volume in international capital markets. During 2000, we derived 25% of our capital markets sales from international; our international capital markets volume increased 56% from 1999. Due to weakness in the U.S. capital markets for much of 2000, our U.S. capital markets sales were down 12% from 1999. Net sales of our Logistics Services segment of $691 million in 2000 included $365 million from the acquisition of package logistics. Net sales of our print logistics business increased $44 million, or 15.6%, from 1999, driven almost entirely by higher freight services volume, despite a small decline in expedited services volume. Value added revenue for the Commercial Print segment increased $153 million, or 5.1%, from 1999. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, value added revenue for Commercial Print increased 2.6%, primarily due to strong volume increases in Long run Magazines, Catalogs and Inserts and higher by product revenues. Incremental revenues from by products for Commercial Print increased value added revenue by 1.0% between years. Value added revenue for the Logistics Services segment of $122 million in 2000 included $59 million from package logistics. Excluding package logistics, value added revenue of our print logistics business increased 2.9% from 1999. Earnings from operations for the Commercial Print segment were down less than 1% between years. Our traditional print businesses (long run and book) had strong volume increases and productivity gains in 2000, particularly during the first half, and higher income from by products. Earnings from operations were hurt during the second half by escalating energy and healthcare costs, and higher employee turnover at several of our plants. For the full year, earnings from operations were affected negatively by Financial Services and RRD Direct, our direct mail operation. Financial Services was hard hit by the U.S. capital markets slow down. RRD Directs volume declined as a result of a decrease in sweepstakes and credit card solicitations. In both Financial Services and RRD Direct, we took direct action to address these earnings shortfalls. This included closing two unprofitable production facilities in 2000 for which we incurred a pretax charge of $9 million. In the fourth quarter of 2000, we reorganized RRD Directs sales and marketing efforts. We also made substantial progress addressing operational issues that arose following the consolidation of two of our direct mail facilities. Our Logistics Services segment incurred a loss from operations of $14 million in 2000, equal to package logistics loss for the year. Package logistics was affected negatively in 2000 by low price levels in response to competition, the impact of low margin work and new facility start up costs. In order to increase volume and drive deeper penetration of the postal system (closer to the final destination), package logistics delivered packages for a number of large mailers at price levels that proved to be unprofitable. Levels of this low margin work peaked during the fourth quarter and negatively affected results. Excluding package logistics, earnings from operations of our print logistics business were break even in 2000, down $8 million from 1999, with the majority of the shortfall occurring in the fourth quarter of 2000. This decrease was driven by higher transportation costs, primarily due to increased carrier and fuel costs and start up problems following expansion of our Northeast distribution facility. Despite higher freight services volume, transportation costs were up 7% between years on an average per unit basis. Earnings (loss) from operations within the Other operating segment include losses of $28 million and $8 million in 2000 and 1999, respectively, to grow complementary businesses, including Red Rover. 20 Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Because of our scale, manufacturing experience and strong customer base, we continue to generate strong cash flows from our printing businesses. We plan to use these cash flows to continue our transformation in several key areas and invest in future growth to create value for our shareholders. This includes an upgrade of our print platform to enable us to better serve our customers in a more cost effective, flexible and efficient manner. Second, it includes building value added services upstream toward our customers and downstream toward the consumer. In addition, we will continue to invest in programs that provide the foundational support underlying these transformation efforts, including continuous improvement, business process redesign and cultural change. If we do not have investment opportunities that generate returns above our cost of capital, our philosophy is to return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchase, while maintaining our targeted capital structure. We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the limited use of derivative financial instruments. We enter into interest rate swaps to manage our interest costs and exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, from time to time we enter into forward and option contracts to minimize potential exchange risk and transaction losses in non U.S. entities with non functional currency denominated borrowings, sales, purchases or expenses. We do not use derivatives for trading purposes and we are not a party to leveraged derivatives. During 2001, we entered into two interest rate swap agreements to exchange fixed rate for floating rate payments periodically over the life of certain outstanding debt instruments. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges and were highly effective as of December 31, 2001. We also entered into a third interest rate swap agreement to exchange floating rate for fixed rate payments. See the Debt Financing and Interest Expense note to the consolidated financial statements on page F 21 for details. While we continue to review our COLI tax position in light of recent court cases involving other taxpayers, disallowance by the Internal Revenue Service of our COLI deductions for the years 1993 through 1998 could result in additional cash payments upon settlement. See the Income Taxes note to the consolidated financial statements on page F 19 for a discussion of COLI tax matters. As of December 31, 2001, our only off balance sheet financing activities were non cancelable operating lease commitments described in the Commitments and Contingencies note to the consolidated financial statements on page F 14. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash flow from operations in 2001 was $548 million, a decrease of $192 million from 2000. This decrease was primarily due to the receipt in 2000 of a tax refund of $77 million related to the carryback of tax losses following the sales of MMI, CS&T and Stream in 1999; a COLI tax payment of $62 million in 2001 as a result of the settlement of a federal income tax audit for the years 1990 through 1992; and the weaker operating performance of the company in 2001. Our cash conversion cycle (days sales outstanding plus days inventory on hand minus days payable outstanding) was stable at 48 days for 2001 and 2000. The ratio of operating working capital* to sales has continued to improve to 5.5% in 2001 from 6.1% in 2000 and 6.9% in 1999. Cash flows from operations increased by $105 million in 2000, primarily due to the receipt of the tax refund of $77 million in 2000 and reduced investments in operating working capital.  * Operating working capital is defined as current assets (including cash) less current liabilities (excluding debt, taxes and restructuring reserves). Cash Used in Investing Activities Our principal recurring investing activities are capital expenditures to improve the productivity of operations. In 2001, capital expenditures totaled $273 million, a $36 million increase compared to 2000 spending of $237 million. During 2001, we opened a second printing plant in Poland and several facilities within our Premedia Technologies group, located in New York, Oregon and Warsaw, Poland, to better serve our customers 21 content management and communications needs. The higher level of spending in 2001 was driven by these expansions and our investments to create a more efficient print platform to serve our long run magazine, catalog and advertising insert customers. Beginning in 2001 and extending into 2003, we expect to invest up to $300 million in this print platform, a third of which relates to restructuring activities, to create fewer, larger and more efficient facilities to better serve our customers (see discussion under the caption Restructuring and Impairment and Other One Time Items, above). We expect to fund these actions primarily through cash provided by our operations. Acquisitions We made no business acquisitions in 2001. In 2000, we made several business acquisitions and investments to extend our geographic reach and expand our range of capabilities. Acquisitions completed in 2000 included: Omega Studios Southwest, Inc. (January 2000) This dedicated photography studio expanded our premedia offerings in digital photography and creative services, and extended our geographic reach to the Southwest. CTC (February 2000) This mailer of business to home packages in the U.S. more than doubled the revenues of our Logistics Services segment, enhanced our scale and expanded our service offering to include the delivery of packages in addition to printed products. Iridio, Inc. (February 2000) This full service premedia company, which provides digital photography, prepress, digital asset management and digital print services, brought us a significant presence in the Pacific Northwest. EVACO, Inc. (February 2000) This financial printer based in Florida expanded our Financial Services operations in the Southeast. Circulo do Livro (July 2000) This Brazilian book printer expanded our capabilities to serve the book publishing market and, together with expansion of our Hamburg Grfica Editora division, made us the largest book printer in South America. Divestitures See the Divestitures note to the consolidated financial statements on page F 7 for details. Cash Provided by Financing Activities Financing activities include net borrowings, dividend payments and share repurchases. Our net borrowings increased by $57 million in 2001. Commercial paper is our primary source of short term financing. On December 31, 2001, we had $16 million outstanding in commercial paper borrowings. In addition, at December 31, 2001, we had a $431 million unused revolving credit facility with a number of banks. This facility provides support for issuing commercial paper and other credit needs. Management believes our cash flow and borrowing capability are sufficient to fund operations. Share Repurchases We acquired 8.8 million, 2.5 million and 11.9 million shares of our stock in 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively, for $248 million, $63 million and $379 million, respectively, in privately negotiated or open market transactions. Since 1996, we have spent $1.5 billion to repurchase stock and reduced the number of shares outstanding by 28%. 22 Net cash used to repurchase common stock, defined as cash used for share repurchases net of proceeds from stock options exercised, was $250 million in 2001; $22 million in 2000; and $350 million in 1999. A summary of the shares outstanding is presented below: 2001 2000 1999 In Thousands As of December 31 Basic 113,122 121,055 123,237 Dilutive effect 2,069 1,629 125 Total 115,191 122,684 123,362 Full Year Average Basic 116,728 122,323 128,872 Dilutive effect 1,770 770 694 Total 118,498 123,093 129,566 In January 2001, the board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $300 million of the companys common stock in privately negotiated or open market transactions. From February 1, through December 31, 2001, under this program we purchased approximately 7.7 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $218 million. The authorization expired on January 31, 2002. Dividends Dividends to shareholders totaled $110 million in each of 2001 and 2000 and $111 million in 1999. In 2001, we increased our dividend by 4%, representing our 31st consecutive annual dividend increase. We have consistently paid a dividend since becoming a public company in 1956. Financial Condition Our financial position remains strong as evidenced by our year end balance sheet. Our total assets in 2001 were $3.4 billion compared with $3.9 billion at the end of 2000. Average invested capital (total debt and equity, computed on a 13 month average) was $2.3 billion in 2001, compared with $2.4 billion at the end of 2000. Lower income from continuing operations, excluding one time items, reduced the return on average invested capital to 10.0% from 13.2% a year ago. At year end 2001, the debt to capital ratio increased to 54% from 45% in 2000 and year end debt to total market value was flat at 24% compared with 2000. We also consider interest coverage ratios when reviewing our capital structure. Our ratio of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), excluding one time items, to interest expense, was 10.3 at year end, compared with 10.1 a year ago. Other Information Human Resources As of December 31, 2001, we had approximately 33,000 employees. Approximately 81% of our employees work in the U.S., and approximately 3% of those are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Of the approximately 6,000 people working in our international operations, 29% are covered by collective bargaining agreements as is customary in those locations. Minority representation among our U.S. workforce during 2001 increased by 13% based on our governmental reporting. Minority representation was 14% among our U.S. professionals, officials and managers, 23 while female representation was 35%. Minorities represented 19% of our U.S. workforce and females represented 33%. Environmental, Health and Safety Our business is subject to various laws and regulations governing employee health and safety and environmental protection. Our policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, and our objective is to create an injury free workplace. We strive to achieve the highest performance standards of environmental performance and employee health and safety within both the printing industry and the manufacturing community. Since 1987, we have reduced releases and off site transfers reported under the U.S. Environmental Protection Agencys Toxic Release Inventory program by 80%. In addition, we have reduced the generation of hazardous waste by more than 49% since 1988 by applying various techniques. In the area of employee health and safety, we have reduced our Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) recordable injury and illness and our days away from work rates consistently over the past five years. Since 1994, our OSHA recordable rate has decreased by more than 46% and our days away rate has declined more than 73%. We do not anticipate that compliance with laws and regulations in these areas will have a material adverse effect on our competitive or consolidated financial position. Technology We remain a technology leader and hold 180 patents in print related technology, including 20 patents in the emerging area of digital printing. We are a leader in technologies such as computer to plate, customer connectivity and digital imaging capabilities. Public recognition for our technology efforts in 2001 include the following rankings among all U.S. companies: #1 of the most innovative media and entertainment company users of information technology (Information Week, September 17, 2001); and #115 of the top 500 leading IT innovators (Information Week, September 17, 2001). Litigation and Contingent Liabilities For a discussion of certain litigation involving the company, see the Commitments and Contingencies note to the consolidated financial statements on page F 14. For a discussion of our corporate owned life insurance programs, see the Income Taxes note to the consolidated financial statements on page F 19. New Accounting Pronouncements Effective January 1, 2001, we adopted SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended by SFAS No. 138, Accounting for Certain Derivative Instruments and Certain Hedging Activities. These statements require that all freestanding derivatives and many derivatives embedded in other contracts be recognized on the balance sheet as either an asset or liability measured at fair value. Changes in the derivative instruments fair value will be recognized currently in earnings or in other comprehensive income if specific hedge accounting criteria are met. Special accounting for qualifying hedges allows a derivative instruments gains and losses to offset related results of the hedged item in the income statement, to the extent effective, and requires that we formally document, designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting. 24 We have limited transactions that fall under the accounting rules of SFAS No. 133. We have entered into three interest rate swaps to manage certain of our interest rate costs and exposure to changes in interest rates. In accordance with the provisions of SFAS No. 133, we record the fair value of these instruments on our balance sheet and recognize changes in fair market value currently in earnings. The effect of recording the gains and losses on these instruments resulting from changes in fair value from inception is not material to our results of operations or financial position. In addition, from time to time, we enter into forward and option contracts to minimize potential exchange risk and transaction losses in non U.S. entities with nonfunctional currency denominated borrowings, sales, purchases or expenses. We do not use derivatives for trading purposes and we are not a party to leveraged derivatives. In July 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, and SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. SFAS No. 141 requires that all business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. SFAS No. 142, which must be implemented in January 2002, requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets not be amortized over an estimated useful life. Instead, goodwill must be assessed for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value based test. We anticipate that future earnings will increase without amortization expense; however we must assess our existing goodwill for impairment under the new standard. In accordance with the transition provisions of the new standard, we may record a charge for a change in accounting principle for any impairment of goodwill during 2002. During both of the years ended December 31, 2001 and 2000, we recognized goodwill amortization of $18 million ($13 million and $14 million after tax, or $(0.11) per diluted share for 2001 and 2000, respectively). Outlook The environment is highly competitive in most of our product categories and geographic regions. Competition is based largely on price, quality and servicing the special needs of customers. Industry analysts believe that there is overcapacity in most commercial printing markets. Therefore, competition is intense. Our intent is to differentiate our service offerings so that we are viewed by our customers as a partner that can help them deliver effective and targeted communications in the right format to the right audience at the right time. We are a large user of paper, supplied to us by our customers or bought by us. The cost and supply of certain paper grades used in the manufacturing process will continue to affect our financial results. However, management currently does not see any disruptive conditions affecting prices or supply of paper in 2002. Postal costs are a significant component of our customers cost structures. Postal rates increased in both January 2001 and July 2001. These increases have not had a negative effect on us. An additional increase has been proposed for the second half of 2002. Postal rate increases can enhance the value of Donnelley Logistics to our customers, as we are able to improve the cost efficiency of mail processing and distribution. This ability to deliver mail on a more precise schedule and at a lower relative cost should enhance our position in the marketplace. The cost of energy affects our operating costs in the Commercial Print segment and transportation costs in Logistics Services. In Logistics Services, increases in fuel costs can be offset by fuel surcharges passed on to customers, but increases in other energy costs could affect our consolidated financial results. In addition, consumer confidence and economic growth are key drivers of demand for our services. The slowdown experienced in the U.S. and international economies is affecting demand across most of our businesses. As we enter 2002, uncertainty in the economy has led certain of our customers to indicate that they anticipate flat or falling demand in their end markets throughout 2002. In the longer term, technological changes, including the electronic distribution of information, present both risks and opportunities for the company. Many of our strategies leverage our distinctive capabilities to participate 25 in the rapid growth in electronic communications. Our goal remains to help our customers succeed by delivering effective and targeted communications in the right format to the right audience at the right time. We believe that with our competitive strengths, including our comprehensive service offerings, technology leadership, depth of management experience, customer relationships and economies of scale, we can develop the most valuable solutions for our customers, which should result in growth in shareholder value. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates. However, we generally maintain more than half of our debt at fixed rates (approximately 64% at December 31, 2001) and therefore our exposure to short term interest rate fluctuations is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements. Our exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates also is immaterial to our consolidated financial statements, and we occasionally use financial instruments to hedge exposures to foreign exchange rate changes. We do not use financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives. For further disclosure relating to financial instruments, see the Debt Financing and Interest Expense note to the consolidated financial statements on page F 21.
