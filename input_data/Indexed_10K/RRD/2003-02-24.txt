ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in Item 15 of Part IV of this Form 10 K. Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The SEC has defined a companys most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the following critical accounting policies and judgments. Although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available when they are made. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition We recognize print revenue when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and the earnings process is complete. Approximately 60% of our business is under contract. Contracts typically specify F.O.B. shipping point terms. We recognize revenue upon final shipment for a print job and not on a partial shipment basis. For most print jobs, it is common for customers to inspect the quality of the product at our facilities up to and including at the time of shipment. Our products are not shipped subject to any contractual right of return provisions. Absent specific contract terms, we recognize revenue upon final delivery of the product or upon completion of the service performed. Revenues related to our Premedia Technologies operations, which include digital content management such as photography, color services and page production, are recognized in accordance with the terms of the contract, typically upon shipment of the completed product if sold as a part of a final printed product, or once the service has been performed and accepted by the customer if sold separately (e.g., digital photography). With respect to Donnelley Logistics, whose operations include the delivery of packages and printed material, we recognize revenue upon completion of the delivery services we provide. Accounting for Goodwill and Certain Other Intangibles In assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded. On January 1, 2002, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and are required to assess goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at a minimum annually, using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit. The first step is a screen for impairment, and the second step measures the amount of any impairment. These tests utilize fair value amounts that are determined by discounting estimated future cash flows developed by management. We completed the transitional test for impairment in the second quarter of 2002 and the annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter of 2002. We did not record any goodwill impairment in conjunction with these reviews. Commitments and Contingencies We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, employment and other matters. Periodically, we review the status of each significant matter and assess potential financial exposure. If 12 Table of Contents the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for a description of certain legal proceedings. Long lived Assets We are required to assess potential impairments of long lived assets in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for Impairment of Long Lived Assets, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based upon the most recent information available. Estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows developed by management. Long lived assets that are held for disposal are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or the fair market value less the estimated cost to sell. Our long lived assets primarily include property, plant and equipment and other noncurrent assets (primarily the costs of acquiring print contracts and volume guarantees that are amortized to net sales over the periods in which benefits will be realized). Investments in affordable housing, which are included in other noncurrent assets, are recorded at cost, as adjusted for any declines in the fair value of the underlying properties that are deemed to be other than temporary. Our basis for determining fair value of the underlying properties requires applying managements judgment using a significant number of estimates. We derive our estimates of fair value using remaining future tax credits to be received and expected residual values upon sale or disposition of our ownership interests. Expected residual values are developed from industry assumptions and cash flow projections provided by the underlying partnerships, which include certain assumptions with respect to operating costs, debt levels and certain market data related to the properties such as assumed vacancy rates. Should these assumptions differ from actual results in the future, we may be required to further writedown our carrying value of these investments. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 3, Acquisitions and Investments, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Accounting for Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be materially different than that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. Defined Benefit Retirement Plans We present the status of our defined benefit obligations and related plan assets in Note 9, Retirement Plans, to the consolidated financial statements. Plan assets, which consist primarily of marketable equity securities and corporate and government fixed income securities, are valued using market quotations. Plan obligations and annual pension and postretirement benefit income are determined by actuaries using a number of key assumptions. Key assumptions include the discount rate, the estimated future return on plan assets, and the anticipated rate of future salary increases. We determine the discount rate to be used for purposes of computing annual income or expense as of the beginning of the year (using a measurement date of September 30), based on high quality corporate bond yields as of that date. The weighted average discount rates assumed for determining annual pension and postretirement income in 2002 were 6.9% and 7.0%, respectively. We expect to lower the discount rates for purposes of determining pension and postretirement income to 6.7% and 6.8%, respectively, in 2003 due to a decline in high quality corporate bond yields as of September 30, 2002. We determine the estimated return on plan assets primarily based on long term historical returns of equity and fixed income markets according to our respective plan allocations. The weighted average expected asset 13 Table of Contents return for our pension plans as of the end of 2002 was 9.4%. Plan assets for our pension plans are generally allocated as follows: domestic equity (70%); non U.S. equity (20%) and fixed income securities (10%). By assuming historic returns of 10% for equity and 6% for fixed income securities as a benchmark, the weighted average expected return based on our pension plan asset allocation would be 9.6% compared with our assumed rate of 9.4%. While we have assumed no change in targeted asset allocation percentages for 2003, we intend to lower our expected long term rate of return to 9.0% based on declines in equity market performance, primarily over the last three years, versus long term historical averages. The weighted average expected asset return for our postretirement benefit plans as of the end of 2002 was 9.0%. Plan assets for our postretirement benefit plans are generally allocated as follows: domestic equity (55%), non U.S. equity (20%) and fixed income securities (25%). By assuming historic returns of 10% for equity and 6% for fixed income securities, the weighted average expected return based on our postretirement benefit plan allocation would be 9.0%, which is consistent with our assumptions. While we have assumed no change in asset allocation percentages for 2003, we intend to lower our expected long term rate of return to 8.5% based on declines in equity market performance, primarily over the last three years, versus long term historical averages. As a result of the expected assumption changes for 2003 as noted above, we anticipate pension and postretirement income to be reduced by approximately $17 million in 2003. We do not expect to make any significant cash contributions to the plans during 2003. Other Matters Other than non cancelable operating lease commitments, we do not have off balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as special purpose entities. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its majority owned subsidiaries. Minority interests in the income or loss of consolidated subsidiaries are included in other income (expense) in the consolidated income statement. Intercompany items and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Financial Review In the financial review that follows, we discuss our results of operations, financial condition and certain other information. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that begin on page F 1. 14 Table of Contents Items Affecting Comparability of 2002 with 2001 The following significant items affect comparability of the consolidated statements of income and segment operating results: Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 Earnings before Income Taxes Net Income Per Diluted Share Earnings before Income Taxes Net Income Per Diluted Share In Thousands, except per share data As reported $ 175,733 $ 142,237 $ 1.24 $ 74,894 $ 24,988 $ 0.21 Included in earnings from operations: Restructuring and impairment charges $ (88,929 ) $ (54,104 ) $ (0.47 ) $ (195,545 ) $ (136,752 ) $ (1.15 ) Gain on sale of assets(1) 6,890 6,890 0.06 Provision for litigation(1) (16,000 ) (9,600 ) (0.08 ) Impact of goodwill amortization(1) (16,092 ) (12,018 ) (0.10 ) (98,039 ) (56,814 ) (0.49 ) (211,637 ) (148,770 ) (1.25 ) Included in other income (expense): Gain on sale of businesses and investments 6,350 6,350 0.06 6,641 6,641 0.05 Affordable housing write downs (26,000 ) (15,600 ) (0.14 ) (8,400 ) (5,040 ) (0.04 ) Other investment write downs (18,536 ) (18,536 ) (0.16 ) Impact of goodwill amortization (1,491 ) (1,375 ) (0.01 ) (19,650 ) (9,250 ) (0.08 ) (21,786 ) (18,310 ) (0.16 ) Included in tax benefit (provision): Reversal of excess COLI tax reserves 30,000 0.26 Total significant items $ (117,689 ) $ (36,064 ) $ (0.31 ) $ (233,423 ) $ (167,080 ) $ (1.41 ) (1) Included in cost of sales on the consolidated statements of income on page F 2. Restructuring and impairment: Operating results for 2002 and 2001 were affected by the following restructuring and impairment items: 2002 included pretax restructuring and impairment charges of $89 million ($54 million after tax, or $0.47 per diluted share). The 2002 pretax charge included $15 million to close our Berea, Ohio facility, which is included in the Donnelley Print Solutions segment, as well as additional workforce reductions at several other facilities throughout the company. Due to the magnitude of the workforce reductions that occurred in 2002, we recorded a pretax restructuring and impairment charge of $8 million in 2002 within the Corporate segment related to a curtailment loss on our postretirement benefit plans. In addition, we incurred certain costs in 2002 associated with defined exit activities from previously announced restructuring plans. Restructuring and impairment charges for 2002 by segment were as follows: Donnelley Print Solutions: $55 million; Logistics Services: $2 million; Corporate: $16 million and Other: $16 million. 2001 included pretax restructuring and impairment charges of $196 million ($137 million after tax, or $1.15 per diluted share). The 2001 pretax charge included $106 million related to various restructuring actions, and $90 million related to write downs to adjust the carrying values of certain businesses. During 2001, we announced the closure of four U.S. manufacturing operations within the Donnelley Print Solutions segment, and print production at a Financial Services sales center included in the Other segment. In addition, in 2001 we announced the closure of two international operations both included in the Other segment. The $106 million pretax charge for 2001 by segment was as follows: Donnelley 15 Table of Contents Print Solutions: $86 million; Logistics Services: $1 million; Other: $15 million and Corporate: $4 million. Also during 2001, in accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets to be Disposed of, we recorded a pretax impairment charge of $90 million to adjust the carrying values of certain businesses to fair value. The $90 million pretax charge for 2001 by segment was as follows: Donnelley Print Solutions: $11 million and Other: $79 million. For a further description of restructuring activities and cumulative activity since inception of the restructuring plans, see Note 4, Restructuring and Impairment, to the consolidated financial statements. Gain on sale of assets: 2002 included a $7 million pretax gain on the sale of our York, England manufacturing facility following the opening of our newly constructed plant in Flaxby, England, included in the Donnelley Print Solutions segment. Provision for litigation: 2002 included a $16 million pretax provision for the settlement of certain litigation included in the Corporate segment; see Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Gain on sale of businesses and investments: 2002 included a $6 million pretax gain from the collection of a note receivable that had been previously reserved in connection with the sale of our investment in Modus Media International (MMI) in 1999 and which was included within the Corporate segment. 2001 included a pretax gain of $7 million related to the sale of our remaining interest in Stream and was included in the Other segment. Affordable housing write downs: 2002 included a pretax charge of $26 million to write down the carrying value of our investments in affordable housing compared with a pretax charge of $8 million in 2001. The write downs reflected declines in the underlying estimated fair value of our affordable housing investments and were included in the Corporate segment; see Note 3, Acquisitions and Investments, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Other investment write downs: 2001 included a pretax loss of $19 million on the write down of several Internet technology related investments and was included in the Other segment; see discussion under the caption Restructuring and Impairment and Other Items, below. Reversal of excess COLI tax reserves: 2002 included an after tax benefit of $30 million from the reversal of excess tax reserves related to our settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for disputed COLI deductions; see Note 10, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements. Impact of Goodwill Amortization: As discussed in Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements, we adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets as of January 1, 2002. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized after the date of adoption of the standard. SFAS No. 142 does not permit the restatement of previously issued financial statements, but does require disclosure of the impact on prior results adjusted to exclude amortization expense related to goodwill and intangible assets which are no longer being amortized. 2001 results included $18 million ($13 million after tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) of goodwill amortization expense. Goodwill amortization expense by segment for 2001 was as follows: Donnelley Print Solutions: $5 million; Logistics Services: $8 million; and Other: $5 million. 16 Table of Contents A summary analysis of expense trends is presented below: 2002 % Change 2001 % Change 2000 In Thousands Cost of materials $ 1,398,944 (17.2 )% $ 1,689,882 (10.6 )% $ 1,890,678 Cost of transportation 599,569 (1.3 ) 607,389 6.9 568,339 Cost of manufacturing* 1,610,118 (9.0 ) 1,769,712 (5.7 ) 1,876,476 Depreciation 288,499 (8.7 ) 315,937 (3.2 ) 326,349 Amortization** 63,873 1.7 62,786 (2.0 ) 64,053 Selling and administrative expenses* 523,388 (5.7 ) 554,914 (5.0 ) 584,298 Restructuring and impairment charges 88,929 (54.5 ) 195,545 N/A Net interest expense 62,818 (11.8 ) 71,183 (20.6 ) 89,639 * Excludes depreciation and amortization, which are shown separately. ** Includes write downs of affordable housing investments classified as other expense, net, of $26 million, $8 million and $4 million in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Results of Operations 2002 compared with 2001 Consolidated net sales decreased $543 million, or 10.2%, to $4.8 billion compared with $5.3 billion in 2001, driven by the decline in net sales of our Donnelley Print Solutions segment of 11.8%. Net sales of our Logistics Services segment were up 1.1% between years, with an 8.3% increase in net sales for the package logistics business partially offset by a decrease of 7.8% in net sales from print logistics excluding expedited services. For our print related businesses, value added revenue represents net sales less the cost of materials. For some customers, we purchase paper used in the printing process and pass through this cost (referred to as pass through material sales) at a margin that is lower than print and related services; other customers furnish their own paper. The value of customer furnished paper is not reflected in our financial results. For our Logistics Services segment, value added revenue represents net sales less the cost of transportation and postage. By measuring value added revenue, we eliminate the effect of material prices and transportation costs, as well as mix issues related to customer furnished versus Donnelley furnished paper. Consolidated value added revenue decreased $244 million, or 8.1%, to $2.8 billion compared with $3.0 billion in 2001, primarily driven by the decline in value added revenue of our Donnelley Print Solutions segment of 8.4%. Donnelley Print Solutions percentage decline in value added revenue was less than the decline in net sales, primarily due to higher customer furnished paper and improved material yield during 2002. In addition, value added revenue is affected by the price of by product paper we sell. Income from the sale of by products is recorded as a reduction in cost of materials. During 2002, we recognized a reduction in cost of materials of $46 million from by product revenues, compared with $41 million a year ago. Value added revenue of our Logistics Services segment increased 11.3% between years, due to a 21.2% increase in value added revenue for package logistics. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales (gross margin) was 18.2% in 2002 compared with 17.2% in 2001, primarily due to higher gross margins within our Donnelley Print Solutions segment, partially offset by the net effect of several significant items within the Corporate segment. Donnelley Print Solutions gross margin in 2002 benefited from restructuring and productivity gains, the impact of lower goodwill amortization ($5 million), higher by product revenues ($5 million) and gain on sale of assets ($7 million), which more than offset the gross margin impact from lower net sales. Logistics Services gross margin increased between years, driven by the improved performance of both package and print logistics, and lower goodwill amortization ($8 million). Negatively impacting gross margin in 2002 within the Corporate segment was a provision for litigation ($16 million), partially offset by a lower LIFO provision ($8 million). 17 Table of Contents Selling and administrative expenses decreased $34 million, or 6.0%, to $534 million compared with $568 million in 2001. Reductions in volume based incentives (sales commissions), restructuring savings from workforce reductions, lower bad debt expense ($11 million), and lower spending to build complementary businesses ($21 million) in 2002 were partially offset by higher management incentive compensation expense ($5 million), higher expenses to build marketing capabilities ($8 million) and higher benefit expenses, including medical, pension and postretirement benefit costs. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 11.2% in 2002 compared with 10.7% in 2001. Net interest expense decreased 11.8% to $63 million in 2002, primarily due to lower effective interest rates on outstanding debt. Other expense, net, was $6 million in 2002 compared with $1 million in 2001. The primary components of other expense, net, in 2002 were as follows: affordable housing write downs ($26 million) and foreign currency transaction losses, net ($3 million), partially offset by earnings from investments ($6 million); gain on sale of businesses and investments ($6 million) and other miscellaneous income ($11 million). The primary components of other expense, net, in 2001 were as follows: other investment write downs ($19 million); affordable housing write downs ($8 million) and foreign currency transaction losses, net, ($5 million), partially offset by gain on sale of businesses and investments ($7 million) and other miscellaneous income ($24 million). Earnings before income taxes in 2002 were $176 million compared with $75 million in 2001. Earnings before income taxes included $89 million and $196 million in restructuring and impairment charges for 2002 and 2001, respectively, and the other significant items affecting comparability as noted above. The effective tax rate in 2002 was 19.1% compared with 66.6% in 2001. The 2002 effective tax rate included a $30 million benefit from the reversal of excess tax reserves related to our settlement with the IRS surrounding our COLI program (see Note 10, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements). Net income was $142 million, up $117 million from $25 million in 2001. Diluted earnings per share of $1.24 increased $1.03 from $0.21 in 2001.

Other international locations are included within the respective end market. 18 Table of Contents Operating Results by Business Segment 2002 compared with 2001 Net sales of our Donnelley Print Solutions segment decreased $413 million in 2002, or 11.8%, from 2001. Net sales for Magazines, Catalogs and Retail decreased 15.5% between years, which primarily reflected volume decreases and price deterioration across all major markets. The continued economic slowdown during 2002 resulted in lower volumes and more customer bankruptcies within the Catalog and Retail markets, and lower advertising pages for both trade and consumer magazines. The net sales decline in Premedia Technologies was driven by these same factors. Depressed volumes in these markets drove increased competition and pricing pressures, and certain customer work lost due to bankruptcy or other factors has been replaced with lower priced work. Book Publishing Services net sales were relatively flat between years due to volume decreases in the religious and specialty markets and more customer furnished paper, offset by volume increases in the consumer and education markets. Net sales for Telecommunications were down 12.6% between years, primarily due to a shift to more customer furnished paper. Net sales of our Logistics Services segment increased $9 million, or 1.1%, from a year ago. Net sales of print logistics, excluding expedited services, were down 7.8% for 2002, driven by lower volumes from a continued slow economy. Net sales of package logistics were up 8.3% between years. Unit volumes for package logistics were up 26.1% between years, which were partially offset by a mix change toward lighter weight, lower priced packages. Net sales for 2002 for package logistics were also impacted by our decision to cease serving several large mailers during 2001 because of price levels that proved unprofitable. Financial Services 2002 net sales decreased 13.4% from a year ago, driven by lower net sales from both U.S. and international capital markets, primarily during the second and third quarters. During 2002, we derived 85.9% of our capital markets net sales from the U.S. For 2002, our U.S. and international capital markets net sales were down 18.4% and 24.3%, respectively. Within Financial Services, net sales for 2002 from customized communications solutions decreased 4.2% between years. 2002 net sales for RRD Direct were down 22.6% between years, due to lower prices, unfavorable work mix and more customer furnished paper. 2002 net sales for International were down $28 million between years due to declines in Latin America driven by lower volumes and the effects of foreign currency devaluation, partially offset by increases in Europe and China. Value added revenue for the Donnelley Print Solutions segment decreased $179 million, or 8.4%, from 2001, primarily due to volume declines and price deterioration within the Magazines, Catalogs and Retail markets, as well as Premedia Technologies. Value added revenue for Magazines, Catalogs and Retail and Premedia Technologies declined 14.1% and 14.5%, respectively, between years, consistent with the declines in net sales. Value added revenue for Book Publishing Services increased 2.3% compared with 2001 due to increases in the consumer and educational markets, partially offset by declines in the religious and specialty markets. Value added revenue for Telecommunications decreased 1.9% between years, which was less than the percentage decline in net sales due to higher customer furnished paper during 2002 and improved material yield. Value added revenue for the Logistics Services segment increased $19 million, or 11.3%, from 2001. Value added revenue for package logistics increased 21.2% between years, driven by increased postage discounts due to deeper penetration of the postal system (closer to the final destination) and lower per unit transportation costs. Results for package logistics in 2001 were hurt by a higher relative level of large mailers at price levels that proved to be unprofitable. Actions taken throughout 2001 to raise prices and adjust work mix had a positive impact on package logistics value added revenue in 2002. Value added revenue for print logistics was flat between years, primarily due to a reduction in per unit transportation costs driven by operational efficiencies and improved vendor management, which offset volume declines. Value added revenue for Financial Services decreased 12.8% from 2001, driven by the net sales decline noted above, slightly offset by a reduction in material costs due to a shift to more composition and fulfillment work. The decrease in value added revenue in 2002 for both RRD Direct and International was attributable to the declines in net sales noted above. 19 Table of Contents Earnings from operations for the Donnelley Print Solutions segment increased $36 million, or 13.5% from 2001. Earnings from operations included $55 million and $97 million in restructuring and impairment charges for 2002 and 2001, respectively. Earnings from operations continued to be negatively affected by the slowdown in the U.S. economy, particularly in Magazines, Catalogs and Retail. During 2001, we announced actions to better align our cost structure that included the closing of four print facilities within Donnelley Print Solutions. All four of these print facilities, along with our Berea, Ohio printing facility, were closed by the end of the second quarter of 2002 (see discussion under the caption Restructuring, Impairment and Other Items, below). The 2002 impact of productivity initiatives and savings from actions we have taken to restructure our operations have largely offset the effects of volume declines and price erosion on earnings from operations. Also included in earnings from operations in 2002 were lower corporate assessments ($10 million) and lower selling and administrative expenses ($7 million), due to a decrease in management incentive compensation and reduced volume based selling incentives. Earnings from operations for 2002 for the Logistics Services segment were $11 million compared with a loss from operations of $5 million a year ago. This improved performance was driven by higher value added revenue from the package logistics business due to the factors noted above, along with lower goodwill amortization of $8 million. Earnings from operations for the print logistics business increased between years as a result of transportation cost savings noted above, and improved margins in 2002 following start up problems in a distribution center in the Northeast during the fourth quarter of 2000 that continued into early 2001. Earnings from operations in 2002 also benefited from the shutdown of package logistics former headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota in mid 2001. Loss from operations for the Other segment was $61 million in 2002 compared with a loss of $168 million in 2001. Of the $107 million improvement in operating results between years, $78 million related to lower restructuring and impairment charges and $21 million for lower spending on complementary businesses. Spending on complementary businesses in 2001 related primarily to Red Rover Digital (Red Rover), a provider of Internet web site design services, which was shut down during the fourth quarter of 2001. Financial Services loss from operations increased between years due to the severity of the capital markets decline and additional restructuring and impairment charges in 2002. RRD Directs loss from operations decreased between years due to lower restructuring and impairment charges, lower goodwill amortization, savings from previous restructuring actions and higher productivity that more than offset the impact of lower net sales. Internationals loss from operations decreased in 2002 primarily due to lower restructuring and impairment charges and related cost savings in Latin America, partially offset by higher start up costs for our facility in Shanghai, China ($6 million). Loss from operations for the Corporate segment was $10 million in 2002 compared with earnings from operations of $51 million in 2001. The change between years of $61 million in the Corporate segment was due to the following: higher restructuring and impairment charges ($12 million); additional provision for litigation ($16 million); lower benefit plan earnings (excluding service costs allocated to the segments) ($11 million); higher corporate staff expenses ($9 million); lower corporate expense allocations ($19 million) and higher miscellaneous expenses ($2 million), partially offset by a lower LIFO provision ($8 million). For a reconciliation of earnings from operations to earnings before income taxes by segment, see Note 18 Industry Segment Information, to the consolidated financial statements. 20 Table of Contents Items Affecting Comparability of 2001 with 2000 The following significant items affect comparability of the consolidated statements of income and segment operating results: Year Ended December 31 2001 2000 Earnings before Income Taxes Net Income Per Diluted Share Earnings before Income Taxes Net Income Per Diluted Share In Thousands, except per share data As reported $ 74,894 $ 24,988 $ 0.21 $ 433,984 $ 266,900 $ 2.17 Included in earnings from operations: Restructuring and impairment charges $ (195,545 ) $ (136,752 ) $ (1.15 ) $ $ $ Provision for plant closures(1) (8,944 ) (5,366 ) (0.04 ) (195,545 ) (136,752 ) (1.15 ) (8,944 ) (5,366 ) (0.04 ) Included in other income (expense): Gain on sale of businesses and investments 6,641 6,641 0.05 Affordable housing write downs (8,400 ) (5,040 ) (0.04 ) (4,200 ) (2,520 ) (0.02 ) Other investment write downs (18,536 ) (18,536 ) (0.16 ) Gain from demutualization 12,859 7,908 0.06 (20,295 ) (16,935 ) (0.15 ) 8,659 5,388 0.04 Total significant items $ (215,840 ) $ (153,687 ) $ (1.30 ) $ (285 ) $ 22 $ (1) Included in cost of sales on the consolidated statements of income on page F 2. Restructuring and impairment: Operating results for 2001 were affected by the following restructuring and impairment items: 2001 included pretax restructuring and impairment charges of $196 million ($137 million after tax, or $1.15 per diluted share). The 2001 pretax charge included $106 million related to various restructuring actions, and $90 million related to write downs to adjust the carrying values of certain businesses. During 2001, we announced the closure of four U.S. manufacturing operations within the Donnelley Print Solutions segment, and print production at a Financial Services sales center included in the Other segment. In addition, in 2001 we announced the closure of two international operations both included in the Other segment. The $106 million pretax charge for 2001 by segment was as follows: Donnelley Print Solutions: $86 million; Logistics Services: $1 million; Other: $15 million and Corporate: $4 million. Also during 2001, in accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets to be Disposed of, we recorded a pretax impairment charge of $90 million to adjust the carrying values of certain businesses to fair value. The $90 million pretax charge for 2001 by segment was as follows: Donnelley Print Solutions: $11 million and Other: $79 million. For a further description of restructuring activities and cumulative activity since inception of the restructuring plans, see Note 4, Restructuring and Impairment, to the consolidated financial statements. Provision for plant closures: 2000 included a pretax charge of $9 million to close two manufacturing facilities (an RRD Direct facility and a Financial Services printing plant, both included in the Other segment). Gain on sale of businesses and investments: 2001 included a pretax gain of $7 million related to the sale of our remaining interest in Stream, and was included in the Other segment. 21 Table of Contents Affordable housing write downs: 2001 included a pretax charge of $8 million to writedown the carrying value of our investments in affordable housing compared with a pretax charge of $4 million in 2000. The write downs reflected declines in the underlying estimated fair value of our affordable housing investments and were included in the Corporate segment; see Note 3, Acquisitions and Investments, to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Other investment write downs: 2001 included a pretax loss of $19 million on the write down of several Internet technology related investments and was included in the Other segment; see discussion under the caption Restructuring and Impairment and Other Items, below. Gain from demutualization: 2000 included a pretax gain of $13 million related to the sale of shares received from the demutualization of our basic life insurance carrier and was included in the Corporate segment. Results of Operations 2001 compared with 2000 Net sales decreased $467 million, or 8.1%, to $5.3 billion compared with $5.8 billion in 2000. Acquisitions contributed an increase of $104 million in net sales between years, which was more than offset by lower volumes within the Donnelley Print Solutions, Logistics Services and Other segments. Consolidated value added revenue decreased $305 million, or 9.2%, to $3.0 billion compared with $3.3 billion in 2000. Acquisitions contributed an increase of $35 million in value added revenue between years. Value added revenue is affected by the price of scrap (by product) paper we sell. Income from the sale of by products is recorded as a reduction in our cost of materials. During 2001, we recognized a reduction in our cost of materials of $41 million from by product revenues compared with $66 million in 2000, a decrease of 37.8%. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales (gross margin) declined to 17.2% in 2001 compared with 19.1% in 2000, primarily due to lower margins within the Donnelley Print Solutions segment and our Financial Services operations within the Other segment. Gross margin was affected negatively in 2001 by lower volumes and relatively high fixed costs across most of the Donnelley Print Solutions segment, primarily within Magazines, Catalogs and Retail, as well as within Financial Services. Our Logistics Services segment, which has a lower gross margin than our Donnelley Print Solutions segment, also represented a higher proportion of net sales in 2001 (15% versus 12% in 2000). Selling and administrative expenses decreased $30 million, or 5.1%, to $568 million compared with $598 million in 2000. Reductions in volume related costs, including incentive compensation and sales commissions, savings resulting from our elimination of approximately 250 administrative positions company wide ($10 million) and general cost containment were partially offset by increased bad debt expense ($16 million). The increase in bad debt expense during 2001 reflected a deterioration in collections during the year, particularly due to retail bankruptcies. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 10.7% in 2001 compared with 10.4% in 2000. Net interest expense decreased 20.6% to $71 million in 2001, due to lower average debt levels, and lower average short term borrowing rates. Other expense, net, in 2001 was $1 million compared with other income, net, of $23 million in 2000. The primary components of other expense, net, in 2001 were as follows: other investment write downs ($19 million); affordable housing write downs ($8 million) and foreign currency transaction losses, net ($5 million), partially offset by gain on sale of businesses and investments ($7 million) and other miscellaneous income ($24 million). The primary components of other income, net, in 2000 were as follows: gain from demutualization ($13 million) and other miscellaneous income ($16 million), partially offset by affordable housing write downs ($4 million) and foreign currency transaction losses, net ($2 million). Earnings before income taxes decreased $359 million, or 82.7%, to $75 million compared with $434 million in 2000. Earnings before income taxes in 2001 included restructuring and impairment charges of $196 million 22 Table of Contents and the other significant items affecting comparability as noted above. The effective tax rate in 2001 was 66.6% compared with 38.5% in 2000. See Note 10, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of the effective tax rate between years as certain of the significant items affecting comparability did not have an associated income tax provision or benefit as shown in the table above. Net income decreased $242 million, or 90.6%, to $25 million compared with $267 million in 2000. Diluted earnings per share decreased 90.3% to $0.21 in 2001 from $2.17 in 2000. The rate of decrease was slightly lower on a per share basis due to fewer average shares outstanding in 2001.

Operating Results by Business Segment 2001 Compared with 2000 Net sales of our Donnelley Print Solutions segment decreased $343 million in 2001, or 8.9%, from 2000. The incremental impact of acquisitions on net sales between years was not significant. First half net sales of the Donnelley Print Solutions segment were down 6.8% between years. The impact of the economic slowdown worsened in the second half of 2001 as second half net sales decreased by 10.9% between years. Net sales for Magazines, Catalogs and Retail decreased 12.2% between years, which reflected volume decreases across all major markets. Increased retail bankruptcies, as well as lower magazine and retail insert advertising spending, and lower catalog page counts drove the majority of volume declines. Net sales for Book Publishing Services were down 9.2% from 2000 driven by lower volumes in the consumer and religious markets. Net sales for Telecommunications decreased 3.2% between years primarily due to volume shortfalls in the domestic directory market. Net sales of our Logistics Services segment increased $84 million in 2001, or 12.2%, from 2000. We acquired package logistics in February 2000, which contributed an incremental $104 million in net sales between years. Unit volumes for package logistics were up 21.9% between years, partially due to an additional five weeks of activity in 2001. In addition, package logistics benefited from higher pricing in 2001, including a more profitable customer mix. Net sales of our print logistics business were down 6.0% between years, driven primarily by lower freight services volume and, to a lesser extent, reduced expedited services volume. Net sales for Financial Services decreased 22.7% compared with 2000, driven primarily by the slowdown in both U.S. and international capital markets. Capital markets volume was particularly impacted by the events and 23 Table of Contents aftermath of September 11. During 2001, we derived 85.0% of our capital markets sales from the U.S.; our U.S. capital markets sales were down 20.9% from 2000. Due to weakness in the international capital markets during 2001, our international capital markets sales were down 58.6% from 2000. Within Financial Services, net sales for 2001 from customized communications solutions decreased 4.9% between years. Net sales for RRD Direct in 2001 were down 9.5% between years, as work performed in 2000 for the U.S. census was only partially offset by improved price and work mix in 2001. Net sales for International decreased 9.6% between years, primarily due to lower net sales in Latin America from lower volumes and foreign currency devaluation. Value added revenue for the Donnelley Print Solutions segment decreased $199 million, or 8.5%, from 2000, resulting from volume declines across all major markets. The incremental impact of acquisitions on value added revenue between years was not significant. Value added revenue for Magazines, Catalogs and Retail declined 12.4% between years, driven primarily by lower volumes as noted above. By products revenues in the Donnelley Print Solutions segment were down $23 million between years. Value added revenue for the Logistics Services segment increased $45 million, or 36.9%, from 2000. Package logistics contributed an incremental $35 million in value added revenue between years, up 59.1%. During 2000, package logistics was affected negatively by low price levels in response to competition and low margin work for a number of large mailers. In 2001, package logistics benefited from higher net sales, and higher postage discounts due to deeper penetration of the postal system (closer to the final destination), which more than offset increased transportation and handling costs. Value added revenue for 2001 in our print logistics business increased 16.3% from 2000, despite the drop in net sales between years, driven by lower transportation costs. The decline in transportation costs related to better cost management and non recurring start up costs of a new distribution facility in the Northeast during the fourth quarter of 2000. Financial Services 2001 value added revenue decreased 23.0% from 2000, driven by the slowed U.S. and international capital markets. The declines from 2000 in value added revenue for RRD Direct and International were consistent with the declines in net sales. Earnings from operations for the Donnelley Print Solutions segment declined $213 million, or 44.2%, from 2000. Earnings from operations included $97 million in restructuring and impairment charges in 2001. Earnings from operations within Magazines, Catalogs and Retail in particular were hurt by the severity of the volume declines, particularly during the second half of 2001. During 2001, we announced actions to better align our cost structures that included the closing of four print facilities. Two of these facilities were closed in 2001, while the two largest (Des Moines, Iowa and Old Saybrook, Connecticut) ceased operations in the second quarter of 2002. Our Logistics Services segment incurred a loss from operations of $5 million including a $1 million charge for restructuring and impairment compared with a loss of $14 million in 2000. This improved operating performance in 2001 was driven by package logistics, and the positive factors affecting value added revenue noted above. Logistics Services also benefited from reduced expenses in 2001 related to the shutdown of package logistics former headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota during the year. Our print logistics business incurred a loss from operations in 2001, driven by lower freight services volume, as well as lower expedited services volume related to the declines in Financial Services. Within print logistics, the distribution center start up problems in the fourth quarter of 2000, as noted above, were resolved in early 2001, partially offset by additional facility expansion costs during 2001. The loss from operations within the Other segment was $168 million in 2001, compared with income of $8 million in 2000. Of the $176 million decline in operating results between years, $94 million related to higher restructuring and impairment charges in 2001. The loss from operations for both years included expenses of $22 million and $28 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, to grow complementary busineses, including Red Rover, which was shut down during the fourth quarter of 2001. 2000 included an additional operating loss of $2 million for our Louisville distribution center through June 2000, the date of disposition. Earnings from operations within Financial Services were negatively affected in 2001 by the capital markets slowdown, resulting 24 Table of Contents in a net loss from operations in 2001. RRD Direct incurred volume shortfalls during 2001 and experienced operational issues at its Newark, Ohio facility, following the consolidation of another direct mail facility into Newark in 2000. The loss from operations in 2000 included a pretax charge of $9 million to close two plants (an RRD Direct facility and a Financial Services printing plant). The International loss from operations increased in 2001 primarily due to additional restructuring and impairment charges, and volume declines and currency devaluation in Latin America. Earnings from operations for the Corporate segment were $51 million in 2001 compared with $26 million in 2000. This increase was driven by higher benefit plan earnings (excluding service costs) ($9 million); lower provision for LIFO inventories ($4 million) and lower corporate administrative and other unallocated expenses ($16 million), partially offset by higher restructuring and impairment charges ($4 million). For a reconciliation of earnings from operations to earnings before income taxes by segment, see Note 18 Industry Segment Information, to the consolidated financial statements. Other expense, net, for the Other segment in 2001 included a pretax loss of $5 million on our investment in Argentina related to the impact of the devaluation of the Argentine peso, which is the functional currency of our operations in Argentina. While the devaluation was formally announced in January 2002, the currency impact of translating non peso denominated assets and liabilities into U.S. dollars was recorded in 2001. Restructuring and Impairment and Other Items The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Note 4, Restructuring and Impairment, to the consolidated financial statements. During 2002, we recorded pretax restructuring and impairment charges of $89 million ($54 million after tax, or $0.47 per diluted share). The 2002 pretax charge included $15 million related to the shutdown of our Berea, Ohio plant which produced short run specialty magazines and was included within the Donnelley Print Solutions segment. The total 2002 pretax charge was comprised of the following: employee termination benefits related to additional workforce reductions ($37 million); a curtailment loss related to postretirement benefit plans ($8 million); exit costs related to closed facilities ($6 million); relocation costs for defined exit activities which were expensed as incurred ($22 million) and asset impairments to reduce the carrying values of assets held for disposal to fair value ($16 million). 2002 total pretax restructuring and impairment charges by segment were: Donnelley Print Solutions: $55 million; Logistics Services: $2 million; Other: $16 million and Corporate: $16 million. The pretax charge was included as restructuring and impairment charges in the consolidated statements of income on page F 2. During 2001, we recorded pretax restructuring and impairment charges of $196 million ($137 million after tax, or $1.15 per diluted share). Of the total $196 million pretax charge, $106 million related to various restructuring actions announced during 2001, and $90 million related to write downs to adjust the carrying values of certain businesses to fair value. The 2001 pretax restructuring and impairment charges of $106 million by business segment were: Donnelley Print Solutions: $86 million; Logistics Services: $1 million; Other: $15 million; and Corporate: $4 million. The pretax charge was included as restructuring and impairment charges in the consolidated statements of income on page F 2. As part of our efforts to build a more effective print platform, we continually assess each plants scale of operations and geographic location relative to our entire print platform. In 2001, we announced the closure of the following five U.S. manufacturing facilities: St. Petersburg and South Daytona, Florida; Des Moines, Iowa; Old Saybrook, Connecticut; and print production only at a Financial Services sales center in Houston, Texas. Each of these print facilities lacked the necessary scale and geographic location to remain competitive. All customer work produced at these facilities was transferred to other company facilities once necessary expansions to accommodate the new work were complete. 25 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2002, all five U.S. manufacturing facilities (both Florida facilities; Des Moines, Iowa; Old Saybrook, Connecticut and Berea, Ohio) had ceased operations and were considered held for disposal. In addition to the five U.S. manufacturing facilities, we closed two additional facilities in 2001 outside of the U.S. due to sales shortfalls from acquisition plans and to streamline costs: Ediciones Eclipse S.A. de C.V. (Eclipse) in Mexico and Hamburg Gr&aacute;fica Editora in Brazil. Eclipse was sold in December 2002 at net book value; the Brazilian facility has also ceased production and was considered held for disposal at December 31, 2002. The net book value of assets held for disposal at December 31, 2002 was $15 million, and included the following breakdown by segment: Donnelley Print Solutions: $14 million and Other: $1 million. During 2001, in accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, we recorded a pretax impairment charge of $90 million to adjust the carrying values of certain of our businesses to fair value. This included write downs with respect to the Donnelley Print Solutions segment: (Berea, Ohio: $11 million) and the Other segment: RRD Direct (Newark, Ohio: $37 million), and International including Argentina (Atl&aacute;ntida Cochrane: $19 million); Brazil (Circulo do Livro and Hamburg Gr&aacute;fica Editora: $11 million); and Mexico (Eclipse: $12 million). The pretax impairment charge of $90 million reduced goodwill by $36 million and property and equipment by $54 million. The write downs were primarily the result of the deterioration in net sales from the original acquisition plans, such that the carrying values of the entities were not considered to be recoverable. We regularly assess our manufacturing platforms to assure that they are efficient, flexible and aligned properly with our customers needs. In March 2001, we announced a $300 million upgrade of our print platform, approximately one third of which related to restructuring costs. This upgrade program included the purchase of seven new presses and two associated binding lines, of which four presses and two binding lines were placed into service as of December 31, 2002. As of December 31, 2002, cumulative capital expenditures related to this upgrade program were $179 million, and we expect to spend an additional $44 million in 2003 to complete the program. As a result of all restructuring actions and impairment write downs since 2000, we realized cost savings in 2002, net of incremental costs associated with the platform upgrade, of approximately $126 million compared with our 2000 cost structure. Of these total savings, $121 million represented the cash component and consisted primarily of salary and employee benefit related savings from workforce reductions of $116 million. The non cash component of $5 million consisted of lower depreciation expense of $13 million, partially offset by incremental depreciation expense related to the platform upgrades of $8 million. Based on restructuring actions announced as of the end of 2001, we expected to realize cost savings of approximately $90 million in 2002 compared with 2000, which included $86 million in projected cost savings due to workforce reductions, and $4 million of lower depreciation expense. During 2002, we substantially completed all restructuring actions announced in 2001, which included all expected workforce reductions and related plant closures, with no significant changes in actual savings from our earlier estimates. The additional incremental savings in 2002 of $36 million related to 2002 announced actions. During 2002, we announced several restructuring actions that included an additional plant closure (Berea, Ohio) and various workforce reductions across the company, resulting in additional cost savings in 2002 of approximately $36 million. These additional cost savings in 2002 consisted of lower salary and employee related benefits due to workforce reductions of $30 million, lower depreciation expense of $1 million, and other miscellaneous expense reductions of $5 million. The two largest plant closures announced in 2001 (Old Saybrook, Connecticut and Des Moines, Iowa) did not cease operations until the second quarter of 2002. Accordingly, 2002 savings discussed above do not reflect a full year of benefits as a result of these plant closures or from the additional restructuring actions announced during 2002. We, therefore, expect to realize additional annualized savings in 2003 of approximately $40 million consisting primarily of lower salary expense and related employee benefits of $34 million. 26 Table of Contents The above reductions in our cost structure for 2002 were offset by the impact of volume reductions and pricing pressures during the year. We expect to drive gains in throughput, productivity and capacity utilization once volume activity levels recover. During 2001, we recorded a pretax charge of $19 million ($19 million after tax, or $0.16 per diluted share) to write down the values of several of our Internet related technology investments. The largest such investment was a minority interest in an Internet communications services company that we acquired in 2000 for $14 million for which no publicly traded market data was available. During the fourth quarter of 2001, this Internet communications services company entered into an equity transaction with a third party, which provided a basis for a revised valuation and an impairment of our minority interest. The total $19 million pretax charge was included in other income (expense) as investment write downs in the consolidated statements of income on page F 2. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Because of our scale, manufacturing experience and strong customer base, we continue to generate strong cash flows from our printing businesses. We plan to use these cash flows to continue our transformation in several key areas and invest in future growth to create value for our shareholders. This includes upgrading our print platform to enable us to better serve our customers in a more cost effective, flexible and efficient manner. Further, it includes building value added services upstream toward our customers and downstream toward the consumer. In addition, we will continue to invest in programs that provide the foundational support underlying these transformation efforts, including continuous improvement, business process redesign and cultural change. If we do not have investment opportunities that generate returns above our cost of capital, our philosophy is to return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchase and or dividends, while maintaining our targeted capital structure. The working capital deficiency of $88 million at December 31, 2002, did not affect our ability to operate our business or to meet any of our obligations. From time to time we may operate with a working capital deficiency, but without negative impact on the business due to the timing and availability of other sources of funds. Commercial paper is our primary source of domestic short term financing. On December 31, 2002, we had $21 million outstanding in domestic commercial paper borrowings. In October 2002, we replaced our existing domestic revolving credit facilities with two new revolving credit facilities. The new facilities consist of a short term facility that matures in October 2003 and provides for borrowings of up to $175 million and a long term facility that matures in October 2007 and also provides for borrowings of up to $175 million. The company pays an annual commitment fee on the total unused portion of the credit facilities of 0.07% for the short term facility and 0.09% for the long term facility. The facilities bear interest at variable rates based on the current LIBOR rate and the companys credit rating. As of December 31, 2002, there have been no borrowings under these credit facilities. These facilities provide support for issuing commercial paper and other credit needs. We also maintain various other credit facilities, which are generally uncommitted, to support the financing needs of our non U.S. operating units. Management believes that cash flow and borrowing capability are sufficient to fund operations and planned capital expenditures of the company for the forseeable future. We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the limited use of derivative financial instruments. We enter into interest rate swaps to manage our interest costs and exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, from time to time we enter into forward and option contracts to minimize potential exchange risk and transaction losses in non U.S. entities with non functional currency denominated borrowings, sales, purchases or expenses. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and we are not a party to leveraged derivatives. During 2001, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange fixed rate for floating rate payments periodically over the life of certain outstanding debt instruments. These swaps have been designated as fair value 27 Table of Contents hedges and were highly effective as of December 31, 2002. During 2002 and 2001 we also entered into various interest rate swap agreements to exchange floating rate for fixed rate payments. See Note 11, Debt Financing and Interest Expense, to the consolidated financial statements for details. As of December 31, 2002, our only off balance sheet financing activities were non cancelable operating lease commitments described in Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Cash Flows from Operating Activities Cash flow from operations in 2002 was $409 million, a decrease of $139 million from 2001. This decrease was primarily due to the payment of approximately $130 million related to the COLI settlement (see Note 10, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements) and lower net income excluding non cash charges in 2002, partially offset by a 2001 payment of $62 million related to COLI. Our cash conversion cycle (days sales outstanding plus days inventory on hand minus days payable outstanding) improved to 40 days in 2002 from 48 days in 2001. The ratio of operating working capital* to sales has continued to improve to 2.2% in 2002 from 5.2% in 2001 and 5.8% in 2000. Cash flows from operations decreased by $192 million in 2001, primarily due to the receipt in 2000 of a tax refund of $77 million related to the carryback of tax losses following the sales of certain subsidiaries, a 2001 tax payment of $62 million for COLI tax liabilities as a result of the settlement of a federal tax audit, and weaker operating performance in 2001. * The operating working capital to sales ratio is defined as a 13 month average of net receivables, net inventories and prepaid expenses minus accounts payable, accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities, divided by a 12 month rolling average of net sales. Cash Flows From Investing Activities Our principal investing activities are capital expenditures to improve the productivity of operations. In 2002, capital expenditures totaled $242 million, a $31 million decrease compared with 2001 spending of $273 million. 2002 spending included investments to create a more efficient print platform to serve our magazine, catalog and retail customers and the opening of a printing plant in China. The reduction in capital spending from 2001 is due to lower spending on our new platform and the 2001 openings of a printing plant in Poland and several facilities within our Premedia Technologies group. We expect to continue to fund capital expenditures primarily through cash provided by operations. We expect 2003 capital spending to be below $250 million. Acquisitions We made no business acquisitions in 2002 or 2001. Divestitures In June 2002, we recorded a pretax gain of $6 million ($6 million after tax, or $0.06 per diluted share) upon collection of a note receivable that had been previously reserved in connection with the sale of MMI in 1999. In November 2001, we sold our remaining investment in the common stock of Stream for approximately $10 million in cash. We recognized a pretax gain of $7 million ($7 million after tax, or $0.05 per diluted share) from this transaction. In June 2000, we sold our 100% interest in R.R. Donnelley (India) Ltd. and our 25.37% owned subsidiary, Tata Donnelley Limited, to Tata Sons Limited for approximately $13 million in cash; there was no gain or loss recognized from this transaction. 28 Table of Contents Cash Flows From Financing Activities Financing activities include net borrowings, share repurchases and dividend payments. As of December 31, 2002, total net borrowings decreased $64 million from December 31, 2001, compared with an increase of $57 million for the same period a year ago. This lower level of incremental borrowing in 2002 ($121 million) is primarily due to the expiration of the companys share repurchase program in 2002, partially offset by the companys payment of approximately $130 million related to the COLI settlement. Share Repurchases We acquired 0.5 million, 8.8 million and 2.5 million shares of our stock in 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively, for $15 million, $248 million and $63 million, respectively, in privately negotiated or open market transactions. Since 1996, we have spent approximately $1.5 billion to repurchase stock and reduced the number of shares outstanding by approximately 29%. In January 2001, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $300 million of the companys common stock in privately negotiated or open market transactions. From February 1, 2001 through the expiration date (January 31, 2002), we purchased approximately 8.1 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $230 million under this program. Net cash used to repurchase common stock, defined as cash used for share repurchases net of proceeds from stock options exercised, was $3 million in 2002; $250 million in 2001; and $22 million in 2000. A summary of the shares outstanding is presented below: 2002 2001 2000 In Thousands As of December 31 Basic 113,124 113,122 121,055 Dilutive effect 453 2,069 1,629 Total 113,577 115,191 122,684 Full Year Average Basic 113,060 116,728 122,323 Dilutive effect 1,312 1,770 770 Total 114,372 118,498 123,093 Dividends Dividends to shareholders totaled $111 million in 2002 and $110 million in each of 2001 and 2000. In 2002, we increased our dividend by 4%, representing our 32nd consecutive annual dividend increase. We have consistently paid a dividend since becoming a public company in 1956. Financial Condition Our financial position remains strong as evidenced by our year end balance sheet. Our total assets in 2002 were $3.2 billion compared with $3.4 billion at the end of 2001. Average invested capital (total debt and equity, computed on a 13 month average) was $1.9 billion in 2002, compared with $2.3 billion at the end of 2001. The return on average invested capital increased to 9.4% in 2002 from 3.1% in 2001. The return on average invested capital, excluding the significant items in Item 6 on page 11, increased to 10.4% from 10.0% a year ago. At December 31, 2002, the debt to capital ratio decreased to 52% from 54% in 2001 and year end debt to total market value* was 29% compared with 24% in 2001. * Market value was determined based on the number of basic shares outstanding multiplied by the per share closing price of our common stock as of the respective year ends. 29 Table of Contents Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commitments and Contingencies The following table quantifies our future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2002: Payments Due In Total 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 Thereafter In Thousands Total debt* $ 988,850 $ 245,781 $ 711 $ 166,423 $ 224,551 $ 493 $ 350,891 Operating leases 260,281 61,836 52,463 44,688 41,531 27,589 32,174 Other 71,137 51,127 4,034 3,421 3,421 3,421 5,713 Total $ 1,320,268 $ 358,744 $ 57,208 $ 214,532 $ 269,503 $ 31,503 $ 388,778 * Excludes $10 million related to the fair market value of interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2002, related to debt due in 2006. Other represents contractual obligations for the purchase of property, plant and equipment ($47 million in total) and various outsourced professional services ($24 million in total). We maintain credit facilities in the U.S. and in our international locations that provide support for issuing commercial paper and for meeting the financing needs of our non U.S. operating units. We maintain revolving credit facilities with a group of U.S. and foreign banks that provide for borrowings of up to $350 million, of which $175 million expires in October 2003, and $175 million expires in October 2007. As of December 31, 2002, we had no borrowings under these credit facilities. As of December 31, 2002, our non U.S. operating units had approximately $208 million in available credit facilities, most of which are uncommitted. There were approximately $115 million in borrowings against these facilities at December 31, 2002, which are included in short term or long term debt on the consolidated balance sheet on F 3, as appropriate. Other Information Employees As of December 31, 2002, we had approximately 30,000 employees. Approximately 81% of our employees work in the U.S., and approximately 1.4% of those are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Of the approximately 6,000 people working in our international operations, 24% are covered by collective bargaining agreements as is customary in those locations. Environmental, Health and Safety Our business is subject to various laws and regulations governing employee health and safety and environmental protection. Our policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, and our objective is to create an injury free workplace. We strive to achieve the highest performance standards of environmental performance and employee health and safety within both the printing industry and the manufacturing community. We do not anticipate that compliance with laws and regulations in these areas will have a material adverse effect on our competitive or consolidated financial position. Litigation and Contingent Liabilities For a discussion of certain litigation involving the company, see Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. 30 Table of Contents New Accounting Pronouncements On July 30, 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. This statement rescinds Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (Including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). SFAS No. 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred, rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs covered by this statement include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing, or other exit or disposal activity. This statement will be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002. We do not anticipate that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In December 2002, the FASB issued SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123. This Statement amends FASB Statement No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. As of December 31, 2002, we have elected not to change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. We account for employee stock options under Accounting Principles Board (APB) No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, under which no compensation cost was recognized by us. In January 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities to provide new guidance with respect to the consolidation of certain previously unconsolidated entities, including special purpose entities. We believe that the adoption of this interpretation, required in 2003, will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. Outlook The environment is highly competitive in most of our product categories and geographic regions. Competition is based largely on price, quality and servicing the special needs of customers. Industry analysts believe that there is overcapacity in most commercial printing markets exacerbated by recent drops in market demand. Therefore, competition is intense. Our intent is to differentiate our service offerings so that we are viewed by our customers as a partner that can help them deliver effective and targeted communications in the right format to the right audience at the right time. We are a large user of paper, supplied to us by our customers or bought by us. The cost and supply of certain paper grades used in the manufacturing process will continue to affect our financial results. However, management currently does not foresee any disruptive conditions affecting prices or supply of paper in 2003. Postal costs are a significant component of our customers cost structures and postal rate changes can influence the number of pieces that our customers are willing to mail. Any resulting decline in print volumes mailed could have an effect on our financial results. Postal rates increased in January 2001, July 2001 and July 2002. Postal rate increases can enhance the value of Donnelley Logistics to our customers, as we are able to improve the cost efficiency of mail processing and distribution. This ability to deliver mail on a more precise schedule and at a lower relative cost should enhance our position in the marketplace. The cost of energy affects our operating costs in the Donnelley Print Solutions segment and transportation costs in Donnelley Logistics. In Donnelley Logistics, increases in fuel costs can be offset by fuel surcharges passed on to customers, but continuing increases in these and other energy costs could affect our consolidated financial results. 31 Table of Contents Consumer confidence and economic growth are key drivers of demand for our services. The slowdown experienced in the U.S. and international economies is continuing to affect demand across most of our businesses. Uncertainty in the economy has led customers across our end markets to indicate that they anticipate flat demand throughout 2003. In the longer term, technological changes, including the electronic distribution of information, present both risks and opportunities for us. Many of our businesses leverage distinctive capabilities to participate in the rapid growth in electronic communications. Our goal remains to help our customers succeed by delivering effective and targeted communications in the right format to the right audiences at the right time. We believe that with our competitive strengths, including our comprehensive service offerings, technology leadership, depth of management experience, customer relationships and economies of scale, we can develop the most valuable solutions for our customers, which should result in increased shareholder value. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As such, the company monitors the interest rate environment and modifies the components of its debt portfolio as necessary to manage funding costs and interest rate risks. Generally, the company maintains at least half of its debt at fixed rates (approximately 52.6% at December 31, 2002). Excluded from the calculation of fixed rate debt at December 31, 2002 is $200 million in fixed rate debt that was swapped to floating rates to take advantage of lower interest rates on floating rate debt. The swap was executed in two transactions that mature in November 2006. To reduce its exposure to future increases in floating interest rates, the company entered into additional floating to fixed swap agreements, effectively fixing the interest rates for the May 15, 2002, November 15, 2002, May 15, 2003 and November 15, 2003 interest rate resets on the original swaps (see Note 14, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements). The companys exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates is immaterial to the consolidated financial statements of the company. The company occasionally uses other financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes. The company uses derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool, and not for trading or speculative purposes. For further discussion relating to financial instruments, see Note 14, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements.
