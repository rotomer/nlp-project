ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and notes to those statements included in Item 15 of Part IV of this Form 10 K. Overview We operate principally in the commercial print portion of the print industry, with related service offerings designed to offer customers complete solutions for communicating their messages to targeted audiences. The dominant macro economic and industry wide trend for the past three years has been weaker demand during a slow economy that has generated excess industry capacity resulting in increased competition and downward pricing pressures. In this intensified competitive pricing environment, companies have focused on reducing costs in order to preserve operating margins. We believe this environment has led to more consolidation within the commercial print industry as companies seek economies of scale, broader customer relationships, geographic coverage and product breadth to overcome/offset industry over capacity and pricing pressures. Beginning January 1, 2003, we revised our segment reporting to reflect Financial as a separate segment. Our Financial operations were previously reported within the Other segment. As a result of these changes, we disclose three reportable segments: Print, Logistics and Financial. The primary drivers affecting our business differ by segment. In our Print segment, consumer confidence and economic growth rates are key drivers of demand for commercial print, as these factors affect the level of advertising and merchandising activity. While general economic trends have recently begun to improve, we have not yet begun to see the positive effects of an economic recovery within our Print segment. Historical trends indicate that magazine advertising pages, a key indicator of demand for printing products and services, recover more slowly after a recession than other sectors of the economy. Our Financial segments results are driven by the level of deal activity in the capital markets, as well as regulatory compliance requirements and our ability to capture market share. During the second half of 2003, we benefited from increased capital markets activity following a three year period of economic slowdown, as well as from our ability to gain market share through our focus on customer service. Continued increases in capital markets activity are likely to positively affect demand for services within our Financial segment. However, volatility in the global capital markets makes it difficult to predict the future level of demand. Our Logistics segment serves our customers by consolidating and delivering printed products (print logistics) and packages (package logistics) to the U.S. Postal Service closer to the final destination, resulting in reduced postage costs and improved delivery performance. As postal costs are a significant component of our customers cost structures, our Logistics segment is focused on providing services that enhance value to customers by improving the cost efficiency of mail processing and distribution. Our print logistics business is subject to many of the same macro economic drivers as our print businesses. However, we have partially overcome negative market demand trends of recent years by growing our volume with products printed by other printers, but delivered by us (third party volume), due to our scale and performance levels. Print logistics is profitable and strategically important to our print customers. During 2003, operating results of our package logistics business were negatively impacted by start up problems at a new consolidation facility, as well as operational issues from a recent acquisition. In addition, we identified weaknesses in our transactional processing systems for packages as we increased our scale of operations and entered into more complex customer and carrier arrangements. Our ability to improve the profitability of our package operations is contingent upon our ability to fully address these operational and transactional processing issues as discussed on pages 23 and 44, as well as to sustain and grow our customer base. 12 Table of Contents In response to the above trends, we have regularly assessed our manufacturing platforms and logistics network to assure that they are efficient, flexible and aligned with customer needs. To meet this objective, we have closed several facilities that lacked the necessary scale and geographic location to remain competitive, and invested in expansions of other more scaleable operations. In addition, we have continued to execute other cost reduction initiatives across all of our operations. We have also implemented strategic initiatives, including productivity programs such as six sigma and process variability reduction, as well as business process redesign, which have positively impacted our financial results and helped to mitigate the effects of price erosion. Likewise, we have focused on creating new revenue opportunities for value added services such as premedia and logistics. As a result, we have created a broader platform to sell more products and services as well as improve incremental revenue and profit growth within our current customer base. In November 2003, we announced that we had entered into a definitive combination agreement (the Combination) with Moore Wallace Incorporated (Moore Wallace). The transaction is anticipated to bring together two print industry leaders with highly complementary products and services to create the worlds premier full service global provider and the largest printing company in North America. The strategy for the combined company will focus on improved returns, lower costs and increased profitability; increased financial strength; and enhanced revenue opportunities. While the detailed plans have not yet been finalized, management believes that the Combination will impact operating results in future periods through improved cross selling efforts by providing a total management solution; leveraging product and distribution strengths; aggressive cost reduction efforts, including headcount and facility rationalization; and increased purchasing power with suppliers to reduce costs and increase efficiencies. Unless indicated otherwise, the discussion and financial results disclosed in this Annual Report on Form 10 K relate to RR Donnelley as a stand alone entity, and do not reflect the impact of the pending Combination with Moore Wallace Incorporated. See Expected Impact of Combination with Moore Wallace Incorporated for further discussion of the transaction. Significant Accounting Policies and Critical Estimates The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The SEC has defined a companys most critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of its financial condition and results of operations, and which require the company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain. Based on this definition, we have identified the following critical accounting policies and judgments. Although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are based upon information available when they are made. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Revenue Recognition We recognize print revenue when title and risk of loss transfers to the customer and the earnings process is complete. Approximately 60% of our business is under contract. Contracts typically specify F.O.B. shipping point terms. We generally recognize revenue upon final shipment for a print job and not on a partial shipment basis. For most print jobs, it is common for customers to inspect the quality of the product at our facilities up to and including at the time of shipment. Our products are not shipped subject to any contractual right of return provisions. Absent specific contract terms, we recognize revenue upon final delivery of the product or upon completion of the service performed. Within our Financial segment, which serves the global financial services end market, we produce highly customized materials such as regulatory S filings, initial public offerings and mutual fund compliance 13 Table of Contents communications, as well as provide EDGAR related services. Revenue is recognized for these customers following final delivery of the printed product or upon completion of the service performed. Revenues related to our Premedia operations, which include digital content management such as photography, color services and page production, are recognized in accordance with the terms of the contract, typically upon completion of the performed service and acceptance by the customer. With respect to Logistics, whose operations include the delivery of packages and printed material, we recognize revenue upon completion of the delivery services we provide. Accounting for Goodwill and Certain Other Intangibles In assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets. If these estimates and related assumptions change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded. On January 1, 2002, we adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, and are required to assess goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment at a minimum annually, using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit. The first step is a screen for impairment, and the second step measures the amount of any impairment. These tests utilize fair value amounts that are determined by discounting estimated future cash flows developed by management. See Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Commitments and Contingencies We are subject to lawsuits, investigations and other claims related to environmental, employment and other matters, as well as preference claims related to amounts received from customers prior to their seeking bankruptcy protection. Periodically, we review the status of each significant matter and assess potential financial exposure. If the potential loss from any claim or legal proceeding is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated, we accrue a liability for the estimated loss. Because of uncertainties related to these matters, accruals are based on the best information available at the time. As additional information becomes available, we reassess the potential liability related to pending claims and may revise our estimates. See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for a description of certain legal proceedings. Long lived Assets We are required to assess potential impairments of long lived assets in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for Impairment of Long Lived Assets, if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. An impaired asset is written down to its estimated fair value based upon the most recent information available. Estimated fair market value is generally measured by discounting estimated future cash flows developed by management. Long lived assets that are held for disposal are recorded at the lower of the carrying value or the fair market value less the estimated cost to sell. Our long lived assets primarily include property, plant and equipment and other noncurrent assets (primarily the costs of acquiring print contracts and volume guarantees that are amortized to net sales over the periods in which benefits will be realized). Investments in affordable housing, which are included in other noncurrent assets, are recorded at cost, as adjusted for our share of any declines in the fair value of the underlying properties that are deemed to be other than temporary. Our basis for determining fair value of the underlying properties requires applying managements judgment using a significant number of estimates. We derive our estimates of fair value using remaining future tax credits to be received and expected residual values upon sale or disposition of our ownership interests. Expected residual values are developed from industry assumptions and cash flow projections provided by the underlying partnerships and include certain assumptions with respect to operating costs, debt 14 Table of Contents levels and certain market data related to the properties such as assumed vacancy rates. Should these assumptions differ from actual results in the future, we may be required to further write down our carrying value of these investments. See Note 1, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 3, Acquisitions and Investments, to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Accounting for Income Taxes Significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and any valuation allowance recorded against the deferred tax assets. In the ordinary course of business, there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain. Additionally, our tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities. Although we believe that our estimates are reasonable, no assurance can be given that the final tax outcome will not be materially different from that which is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. We have recorded deferred tax assets related to domestic and foreign tax loss carryforwards. Limitations on the utilization of these tax assets may apply; accordingly, we have provided a valuation allowance to reduce certain of these deferred tax assets as we have concluded that, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be fully realized. In the event that actual results differ from these estimates, or the estimates are adjusted in future periods, adjustments to the valuation allowance may need to be recorded. It is the companys policy to not record a tax benefit for net operating losses in countries with a limited net operating loss carry forward period. Additionally, no provision has been recorded on unremitted earnings which are considered to be indefinitely invested in non U.S. subsidiaries. Defined Benefit Retirement Plans We present the status of our defined benefit obligations and related plan assets in Note 9, Retirement Plans, to the consolidated financial statements. Plan assets, which consist primarily of marketable equity securities and corporate and government fixed income securities, are valued using market quotations. Plan obligations and annual pension and postretirement benefit income are determined by actuaries using a number of key assumptions. Key assumptions include the discount rate, the estimated future return on plan assets, and the anticipated rate of future salary increases. We determine the discount rate to be used for purposes of computing annual income or expense as of the beginning of the year (using a measurement date of September 30), based on an index of high quality corporate bond yields as of that date. The weighted average discount rates assumed for determining annual pension and postretirement income (expense) in 2003 were 6.7% and 6.8%, respectively. We expect to lower the discount rates for purposes of determining both pension and postretirement income (expense) to 6.0% in 2004 due to a decline in high quality corporate bond yields as of September 30, 2003. We determine the estimated return on plan assets primarily based on long term historical returns of equity and fixed income markets according to our respective plan allocations. The weighted average expected asset return for our pension plans as of the end of 2003 was 8.9%. Plan assets for our pension plans are generally allocated as follows: domestic equity (70%); non U.S. equity (20%) and fixed income securities (10%). By assuming historic returns of 10% for equity and 6% for fixed income securities as a benchmark, the weighted average expected return based on our pension plan asset allocation would be 9.6% compared with our assumed rate of 8.9%. While we have assumed no change in targeted asset allocation percentages for 2004, we intend to lower our expected long term rate of return to 8.5% based on declines in equity market performance, primarily over the last three years, versus long term historical averages. The weighted average expected asset return for our postretirement benefit plans as of the end of 2003 was 8.5%. Plan assets for our postretirement benefit plans are generally allocated as follows: domestic equity (55%), non U.S. equity (20%) and fixed income securities (25%). By assuming historic returns of 10% for equity and 15 Table of Contents 6% for fixed income securities, the weighted average expected return based on our postretirement benefit plan allocation would be 9.0%, compared with our assumed rate of 8.5%. While we have assumed no change in asset allocation percentages for 2004, we intend to lower our expected long term rate of return to 8.0% based on declines in equity market performance, primarily over the last three years, versus long term historical averages. As a result of the expected assumption changes for 2004 as noted above, we anticipate pension and postretirement income to be reduced by approximately $22 million in 2004. We expect to make approximately $17 million in cash contributions to our pension plans during 2004. Other Matters Other than non cancelable operating lease commitments, we do not have off balance sheet arrangements, financings, or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons, also known as special purpose entities. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its majority owned subsidiaries. Minority interests in the income or loss of consolidated subsidiaries are included in other income (expense) in the consolidated income statement. Intercompany items and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. Financial Review In the financial review that follows, we discuss our results of operations, financial condition and certain other information. This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes that begin on page F 1. 16 Table of Contents Items Affecting Comparability of 2003 with 2002 The following significant items affect comparability of the consolidated statements of income and segment operating results for 2003 and 2002: Year Ended December 31 2003 2002 EarningsbeforeIncomeTaxes NetIncome PerDilutedShare EarningsbeforeIncomeTaxes NetIncome PerDilutedShare In Thousands, except per share data As reported $ 208,277 $ 176,509 $ 1.54 $ 175,733 $ 142,237 $ 1.24 Included in earnings from operations: Restructuring and impairment charges $ (16,427 ) $ (13,090 ) $ (0.12 ) $ (88,929 ) $ (54,104 ) $ (0.47 ) By product revenues 47,796 28,677 0.25 46,093 27,656 0.24 Gain on sale of assets 4,312 2,630 0.02 6,890 6,890 0.06 Insurance recovery related to 9/11 2,047 1,228 0.01 1,600 960 0.01 Provision for litigation (16,000 ) (9,600 ) (0.08 ) Pension and postretirement income 311 280 19,907 11,944 0.10 LIFO (provision) benefit (840 ) (504 ) 4,800 2,880 0.03 37,199 19,221 0.16 (25,639 ) (13,374 ) (0.11 ) Included in other income (expense): Affordable housing investment write downs (23,250 ) (13,950 ) (0.12 ) (26,000 ) (15,600 ) (0.14 ) Gain on sale of businesses and investments 5,526 4,039 0.04 6,350 6,350 0.06 COLI related expenses upon policy surrender (4,520 ) (2,712 ) (0.02 ) (17,724 ) (9,911 ) (0.08 ) (24,170 ) (11,962 ) (0.10 ) Included in tax benefit (provision): Tax benefit 45,792 0.40 30,000 0.26 Total items affecting comparability $ 19,475 $ 55,102 $ 0.48 $ (49,809 ) $ 4,664 $ 0.05 Restructuring and impairment: Operating results for 2003 and 2002 were affected by the following restructuring and impairment charges: 2003 included pretax restructuring and impairment charges of $16 million ($13 million after tax or $0.12 per diluted share). The 2003 pretax charge included costs associated with newly announced consolidations and workforce reductions, and costs associated with defined exit activities from previously announced restructuring plans. Included were impairment charges of $7 million ($7 million after tax or $0.06 per diluted share) related to the closure of a directory plant in Chile ($3 million) within the Other segment and a write down of goodwill within the Logistics segment ($4 million). Restructuring and impairment charges for 2003 by segment were as follows: Print: $3 million; Logistics: $4 million; Financial: $3 million; and Other: $6 million. 2002 included pretax restructuring and impairment charges of $89 million ($54 million after tax, or $0.47 per diluted share). The 2002 pretax charge included $15 million to close our Berea, Ohio facility, which is included in the Print segment, as well as additional workforce reductions at several other facilities throughout the company. Due to the magnitude of the workforce reductions that occurred in 2002, we recorded a pretax restructuring and impairment charge of $8 million in 2002 within the Corporate segment related to a curtailment loss on our postretirement benefit plans. In addition, we incurred certain 17 Table of Contents costs in 2002 associated with defined exit activities from previously announced restructuring plans. Restructuring and impairment charges for 2002 by segment were as follows: Print: $55 million; Logistics: $2 million; Financial: $10 million; Corporate: $16 million and Other: $6 million. For a further description of restructuring activities and cumulative activity since inception of the restructuring plans, see Note 4, Restructuring and Impairment, to the consolidated financial statements. By product revenues: 2003 included pretax income of $48 million for by product revenues compared with $46 million in 2002. By product revenues are recorded as a reduction in our cost of materials, the majority of which relates to the Print segment. Gain on sale of assets: 2003 included a $2 million pretax gain on the sale of our Casa Grande, Arizona manufacturing facility, and a $2 million pretax gain on the sale of land in the U.K., both included in the Print segment. 2002 included a $7 million pretax gain on the sale of our York, England manufacturing facility following the opening of our newly constructed plant in Flaxby, England, included in the Print segment. Insurance recovery related to 9/11: 2003 and 2002 both included a $2 million pretax gain from the collection of insurance proceeds from claims related to September 11th, included in the Financial segment and recorded as a reduction in our cost of sales. Provision for litigation: 2002 included a $16 million pretax provision for the settlement of certain litigation, included in the Corporate segment. See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Pension and postretirement income: 2003 included less than $1 million of pretax pension and postretirement income compared with $20 million of pretax income in 2002, primarily in the Corporate segment. The decline between years is primarily a result of changes in our assumptions for expected returns on plan assets and our discount rate. Affordable housing write downs: 2003 included a pretax charge of $23 million to write down the carrying value of our investments in affordable housing compared with a pretax charge of $26 million in 2002. The write downs reflected declines in the underlying estimated fair value of our affordable housing investments and were included in the Corporate segment. Gain on sale of businesses and investments: 2003 included a $4 million pretax gain related to the sale of our 25% equity investment in Global Directory Services Company included in the Print segment and a $2 million pretax gain related to the sale of our cost basis investment in MultiMedia Live included in the Corporate segment. 2002 included a $6 million pretax gain from the collection of a note receivable that had been previously reserved in connection with the sale of our investment in Modus Media International (MMI) in 1999, included in the Corporate segment. COLI related expenses upon policy surrender: 2002 included a $5 million pretax charge for expenses related to the surrender of certain corporate owned life insurance (COLI) policies in conjunction with our settlement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for disputed COLI deductions; see Note 10, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Tax benefit: 2003 included a tax benefit of $46 million, the largest component of which was a non cash benefit of $40 million due to the favorable resolution of IRS audits for 1996 through 1999. In addition, we recorded a $6 million receivable related to refundable income taxes in Latin America due to the utilization of tax loss carrybacks. 2002 included a non cash benefit of $30 million related to our settlement with the IRS for disputed COLI deductions; see Note 10, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for further information. 18 Table of Contents Results of Operations 2003 compared with 2002 Consolidated net sales increased $32 million, or 0.7%, between years to $4.8 billion in 2003, driven by an increase in net sales of our Logistics segment of 16.5% and International of 20.1% included within our Other segment, partially offset by a decline in net sales of our Print segment of 4.4%. Net sales of our Logistics segment increased $129 million between years, which reflected higher net sales across both our print and package logistics businesses. The acquisition of MLI in March 2003 within the package logistics business contributed an incremental $49 million in net sales between years. For our print related businesses, value added revenue represents net sales less the cost of materials. For some customers, we purchase paper used in the printing process and pass through this cost (referred to as pass through material sales) at a margin that is lower than print and related services; other customers furnish their own paper. The value of customer furnished paper is not reflected in our financial results. For our Logistics segment, value added revenue represents net sales less the cost of transportation and postage. By measuring value added revenue, we eliminate the effects of material prices and transportation and postage cost, as well as mix issues related to customer furnished versus RR Donnelley furnished paper. Management, therefore, views value added revenue as a preferable performance measure of its own value added products and services. Other companies may use a measure which is calculated in a similar manner, but which may not be comparable. Consolidated value added revenue increased $14 million, or 0.5%, to $2.8 billion in 2003, driven by an increase in value added revenue of our Logistics segment of 27.6% and International of 21.6% included within our Other segment, partially offset by a decline in value added revenue of our Print segment of 2.9%. Value added revenue of our Logistics segment increased $52 million between years, primarily due to an incremental $43 million in value added revenue from our acquisition of MLI. The Print segments decline in value added revenue of 2.9% was less than the decline in net sales primarily due to higher customer furnished paper and improved material yield in 2003. Value added revenue is also affected by the price of by product paper we sell. Income from the sale of by products is recorded as a reduction in our cost of materials. In 2003, we recognized a reduction in cost of materials of $48 million from by product revenues, compared with a reduction of $46 million a year ago. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales (gross margin) was 17.5% in 2003 compared with 18.2% in 2002, primarily due to declines in gross margin of our Logistics and Print segments, partially offset by a higher gross margin at our Financial segment. The Logistics segment has a lower gross margin than the Print segment and represented a higher proportion of our net sales in 2003 (19.1% in 2003 versus 16.5% in 2002). The Logistics segments gross margin decreased between years, primarily due to start up costs associated with a new consolidation facility in the Northeast ($9 million), the impact of the MLI acquisition ($8 million) and a product mix shift to lighter weight packages. The Print segments gross margin was negatively impacted in 2003 primarily by price deterioration and unfavorable work mix, as well as lower gains on asset sales ($3 million), partially offset by higher volume and the impact of restructuring savings and productivity initiatives. The Financial segments gross margin increased between years, due to a mix shift toward higher margin capital markets work and the impact of restructuring savings and cost reduction initiatives. Selling and administrative expenses increased $15 million between years, or 2.8%, to $548 million in 2003. Compared with 2002, a higher provision for doubtful accounts ($7 million, of which $5 million related to Latin America), increased costs to support sales growth in Europe ($7 million), lower benefit plan earnings ($4 million), incremental selling and administrative expenses related to the MLI acquisition ($2 million), and higher volume based sales incentives (commissions) were partially offset by lower management incentive compensation ($1 million) and restructuring related savings and cost reduction initiatives. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 11.5% in 2003, compared with 11.2% in 2002. 19 Table of Contents Net interest expense decreased $12 million, or 19.8%, in 2003, primarily due to lower effective interest rates and lower average borrowings as compared with the prior year. Other expense, net, was $12 million in 2003 compared with $6 million in 2002. The primary components of other expense, net, in 2003 were as follows: affordable housing write downs ($23 million) and foreign currency transaction losses, net ($1 million), partially offset by earnings from investments ($3 million), gain on sale of businesses and investments ($6 million) and other miscellaneous income ($3 million). The primary components of other expense, net, in 2002 were as follows: affordable housing write downs ($26 million) and foreign currency transaction losses, net ($3 million), partially offset by earnings from investments ($6 million), gain on sale of businesses and investments ($6 million) and other miscellaneous income ($11 million). Earnings before income taxes in 2003 were $208 million compared with $176 million in 2002. Earnings before income taxes included $16 million and $89 million in restructuring and impairment charges for 2003 and 2002, respectively, and the other significant items affecting comparability as noted above. The effective tax rate in 2003 was 15.3% compared with 19.1% in 2002. The lower 2003 effective tax rate reflected a tax benefit of $46 million, including a non cash benefit of $40 million due to favorable resolution of IRS audits for 1996 through 1999. In addition, we recorded a $6 million receivable for refundable income taxes in Latin America due to the utilization of tax loss carrybacks. The 2002 effective tax rate included a $30 million tax benefit related to our settlement with the IRS surrounding our COLI program (see Note 10, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements). Net income was $177 million, up $35 million from $142 million in 2002. Diluted earnings per share of $1.54 increased $0.30 from $1.24 in 2002.

Operating results by business segment for 2003 compared with 2002 are as follows: Print Segment The following table summarizes significant items affecting comparability within the Print segment: 2003 2002 Earnings (loss) beforeIncome Taxes Thousands of dollars As reported $ 312,579 $ 315,593 Included in earnings from operations: Restructuring and impairment charges $ (2,782 ) $ (54,645 ) By product revenues 40,943 40,266 Gain on sale of assets 3,720 6,943 41,881 (7,436 ) Included in other income (expense): Gain on sale of businesses and investments 4,078 Total items affecting comparability $ 45,959 $ (7,436 ) 21 Table of Contents Net sales for our Print segment decreased $135 million in 2003, or 4.4%, from 2002. Net sales for Magazines, Catalogs and Retail decreased $42 million, or 2.7%, between years, primarily reflecting price deterioration and a mix shift to work with a lower price per unit, partially offset by higher volume. The economic slowdown that began in 2000 generated excess industry capacity from reduced demand levels and higher customer bankruptcies resulting in increased competition and pricing pressures. Lower contract prices on renewals have continued to cycle through our 2003 results. The net sales decline of 2.5% in Premedia was driven by these same factors. Net sales of our Book business were down $42 million, or 6.0%, between years, due to lower volumes including fewer reprint orders, lower average prices and a less favorable mix of more soft cover books with a lower price per unit and fewer case bound books. Net sales for Telecommunications were down $47 million, or 7.0%, between years, primarily due to more customer furnished paper and lower average prices, partially offset by higher volume. Value added revenue for our Print segment decreased $57 million, or 2.9%, from 2002, primarily due to the net sales declines noted above, partially offset by improved material yield which lowered material costs. Value added revenue for Telecommunications increased 0.7% between years because of higher volume, as noted above, and favorable foreign currency exchange rates on U.K. directory work that more than offset price declines. This occurred despite a 7.0% decrease in net sales because the portion of the decline in net sales due to more customer furnished paper had no significant impact on value added revenue. Earnings from operations in 2003 for our Print segment increased $3 million, or 1.0%, from 2002. Earnings from operations included $3 million in restructuring and impairment charges for 2003 compared with $55 million in 2002. Our Print segment has not yet begun to see the positive effects of an economic recovery. The negative impact on earnings due to price deterioration and a mix shift to lower margin work as noted above was only partially offset by higher volumes in 2003 and the impact of productivity initiatives and savings related to restructuring actions. Logistics Segment The following table summarizes significant items affecting comparability within the Logistics segment: 2003 2002 Earnings (loss) beforeIncome Taxes Thousands of dollars As reported $ (11,158 ) $ 11,049 Included in earnings from operations: Restructuring and impairment charges $ (3,736 ) $ (2,349 ) Total items affecting comparability $ (3,736 ) $ (2,349 ) Net sales for our Logistics segment increased $129 million, or 16.5%, from a year ago. Net sales of package logistics were up $97 million, or 19.0%, between years. The acquisition of MLI in March 2003 contributed an incremental $49 million in net sales for package logistics between years. Net sales for package logistics excluding MLI were up 9.3% for 2003 due to higher volumes and postal rate increases which were passed through to customers, partially offset by a mix change toward lighter weight, lower priced packages. Net sales of print logistics were up 15.1% for 2003, driven by higher volumes from both our Print segment and from third parties for which we do not provide printing services. Value added revenue for our Logistics segment increased $52 million, or 27.6%, between years, of which $43 million related to the acquisition of MLI. Excluding the acquisition of MLI, value added revenue for our package logistics business was flat between years, despite a 9.3% increase in net sales. In addition to the factors affecting net sales noted above, value added revenue of our package logistics business was negatively impacted 22 Table of Contents in 2003 by higher transportation costs, partially offset by higher postage discounts due to deeper penetration of the postal system. Higher transportation costs between years were driven by transportation rate increases and higher fuel costs. In addition, higher costs in 2003 resulted from start up problems at a consolidation facility in the Northeast, which led to the re routing of packages to other company facilities. These start up problems were not fully resolved by the fourth quarter of 2003, which is the peak time for package delivery. The company has taken actions to address these start up problems, and expects to see significant improvements in operational efficiencies at this facility beginning in early 2004. Value added revenue for our print logistics business increased 11.0% between years, driven by higher net sales, partially offset by higher per unit transportation costs. Excluding the impact of the MLI acquisition, the percentage of value added revenue to net sales for our Logistics segment was 22.7% in 2003, down from 23.9% in 2002. MLI had a significantly higher value added revenue to net sales percentage (86.2%) in 2003. Unlike the rest of our Logistics segment, MLI owns and operates a dedicated fleet of vehicles to provide package distribution services. MLIs value added revenue was a higher percentage of its net sales because these internal operating and distribution costs are included in total cost of sales rather than cost of transportation (which consists of third party freight costs). In 2003, our Logistics segment incurred a loss from operations of $11 million, compared with earnings from operations of $11 million in 2002. The loss from operations in 2003 included a $13 million loss from MLI since its acquisition date of March 2003. The MLI loss included a pretax impairment charge of $4 million to write down goodwill, as the estimated future cash flows for this business were not expected to be sufficient to fully recover its carrying value. In early February 2004, we closed MLIs business to business package delivery operations due to poor performance and significant operating losses incurred, while retaining the business to consumer operations that complement our base package logistics business. Of the total $13 million operating loss in 2003 from MLI, approximately $7 million related to the business to business package delivery operations. Excluding MLI, the loss from operations for our Logistics segment in 2003 was attributable to operational issues within our package logistics business, partially offset by the improved performance of print logistics. Our package logistics business was hurt in 2003 by start up costs of approximately $9 million related to our new consolidation facility in the Northeast. In addition to higher transportation costs to re route packages noted above, we operated a second nearby facility longer than originally anticipated as an operational contingency for the start up problems. This second facility was closed in January 2004. Financial Segment The following table summarizes significant items affecting comparability within the Financial segment: 2003 2002 Earnings (loss) beforeIncome Taxes Thousands of dollars As reported $ 3,210 $ (31,544 ) Included in earnings from operations: Restructuring and impairment charges $ (2,815 ) $ (10,499 ) By product revenues 1,332 1,313 Insurance recovery related to 9/11 2,047 1,600 Total items affecting comparability $ 564 $ (7,586 ) 2003 net sales for our Financial segment decreased $1 million, or 0.3%, from a year ago. Net sales from customized communications solutions decreased 5.9% between years, mostly offset by an increase in capital markets net sales of 3.8%. The 2003 decline in net sales from customized communication solutions was primarily due to lower net sales from investor communications (e.g., prospectuses, annual and semi annual mutual funds 23 Table of Contents statements), which reflected contraction in the mutual fund market and one large non recurring deal in 2002. The increase in capital markets net sales between years was driven by a rebound within the domestic capital markets in the second half of 2003 following a period of economic slowdown, and higher fourth quarter 2003 international net sales. Domestic capital markets net sales in 2003 were essentially flat between years, which reflected higher compliance filings (e.g., SEC periodic reports and annual meeting proxy statements), mostly offset by lower transactional activity in the first half of the year (e.g., S filings, including initial public offerings, secondary offerings and mergers and acquisitions). Value added revenue for our Financial segment in 2003 decreased $1 million, or 0.3%, from the prior year, consistent with the decline in net sales. Earnings from operations for our Financial segment in 2003 were $4 million compared with a loss from operations in 2002 of $33 million. Included in 2003 earnings from operations were restructuring and impairment charges of $3 million consisting primarily of workforce reductions, down $8 million from the prior year. Prior year restructuring actions included the closing of several print facilities and service centers, and related workforce reductions. Earnings from operations in 2003 were also impacted favorably by restructuring savings of approximately $16 million between years, of which $13 million related to workforce reductions and $3 million to lower depreciation. In addition, earnings from operations in 2003 benefited from cost reduction initiatives of approximately $10 million, including savings from the outsourcing of certain composition related services offshore. Operating margins in 2003 also reflected a favorable mix change between years due to increased capital markets activity in 2003, which carries higher operating margins than customized communications solutions. Other and Corporate Segments The following table summarizes significant items affecting comparability within the Other and Corporate segments: 2003 2002 Earnings (loss) before Income Taxes Thousands of dollars As reported $ (96,354 ) $ (119,365 ) Included in earnings from operations: Restructuring and impairment charges $ (7,094 ) $ (21,436 ) By product revenues 5,521 4,514 Pension and postretirement income (1) 311 19,907 LIFO (provision) benefit (840 ) 4,800 Provision for litigation (16,000 ) (2,102 ) (8,215 ) Included in other income (expense): Gain on sale of businesses and investments 1,448 6,350 Affordable housing investment write downs (23,250 ) (26,000 ) COLI related expenses upon policy surrender (4,520 ) (21,802 ) (24,170 ) Included in tax benefit (provision): Tax benefit 45,792 30,000 Total items affecting comparability $ 21,888 $ (2,385 ) (1) Excludes service costs, which are recorded primarily within the Print, Logistics and Financial segments. 24 Table of Contents 2003 net sales for the Other segment increased $39 million, or 8.6%, from a year ago. International net sales in 2003 were up $63 million, or 20.1%, from the prior year, driven by increases in Europe due to volume growth and favorable foreign currency exchange rates, as well as volume growth in Asia, partially offset by lower net sales in Latin America. 2003 net sales for Direct Mail were down $26 million, or 19.0%, from the prior year, driven by lower volume. Included in net sales within the Other segment were $2 million from a start up operation which was shut down during the fourth quarter of 2003. Value added revenue for the Other segment increased $21 million, or 8.4%, from a year ago, consistent with the increase in net sales. The 2003 loss from operations for the Other segment was $38 million compared with a loss from operations of $27 million in 2002. The loss from operations for International in 2003 was higher than the prior year, primarily due to lower volume and an additional $5 million provision for doubtful accounts in Latin America; additional start up costs of a plant in Shanghai, China; and higher restructuring costs of $1 million, partially offset by higher volumes and favorable foreign currency exchange rates in Europe. The loss from operations for Direct Mail in 2003 was higher than the prior year, primarily due to lower volume, partially offset by savings from restructuring actions. Earnings from operations for the Corporate segment were $8 million in 2003 compared with a loss from operations of $10 million in 2002. Higher earnings from operations of $18 million in the Corporate segment between years were due to the following: lower restructuring and impairment charges ($15 million); lower provision for litigation ($16 million); lower management incentive compensation ($9 million); and lower miscellaneous expenses ($2 million), partially offset by lower benefit plan earnings (excluding service costs allocated to the segments) ($18 million); and a higher LIFO provision ($6 million). For a reconciliation of earnings from operations to earnings before income taxes by segment, see Note 18, Industry Segment Information, to the consolidated financial statements. 25 Table of Contents Items Affecting Comparability of 2002 with 2001 The following significant items affect comparability of the consolidated statements of income and segment operating results for 2002 and 2001: Year Ended December 31 2002 2001 EarningsbeforeIncomeTaxes NetIncome PerDilutedShare EarningsbeforeIncomeTaxes Net Income PerDilutedShare In Thousands, except per share data As reported $ 175,733 $ 142,237 $ 1.24 $ 74,894 $ 24,988 $ 0.21 Included in earnings from operations: Restructuring and impairment charges $ (88,929 ) $ (54,104 ) $ (0.47 ) $ (195,545 ) $ (136,752 ) $ (1.15 ) By product revenues 46,093 27,656 0.24 40,964 24,578 0.21 Gain on sale of assets 6,890 6,890 0.06 Insurance recovery related to 9/11 1,600 960 0.01 Provision for litigation (16,000 ) (9,600 ) (0.08 ) Goodwill amortization (16,092 ) (12,018 ) (0.10 ) Pension and postretirement income 19,907 11,944 0.10 36,034 21,620 0.18 LIFO benefit (provision) 4,800 2,880 0.03 (3,500 ) (2,100 ) (0.02 ) (25,639 ) (13,374 ) (0.11 ) (138,139 ) (104,672 ) (0.88 ) Included in other income (expense): Affordable housing investment write downs (26,000 ) (15,600 ) (0.14 ) (8,400 ) (5,040 ) (0.04 ) Gain on sale of businesses and investments 6,350 6,350 0.06 6,641 6,641 0.05 Other investment write downs (18,536 ) (18,536 ) (0.16 ) Goodwill amortization (1,491 ) (1,375 ) (0.01 ) COLI related expenses upon policy surrender (4,520 ) (2,712 ) (0.02 ) (24,170 ) (11,962 ) (0.10 ) (21,786 ) (18,310 ) (0.16 ) Included in tax benefit (provision): Tax benefit 30,000 0.26 Total items affecting comparability $ (49,809 ) $ 4,664 $ 0.05 $ (159,925 ) $ (122,982 ) $ (1.04 ) Restructuring and impairment: Operating results for 2002 and 2001 were affected by the following restructuring and impairment charges: 2002 included pretax restructuring and impairment charges of $89 million ($54 million after tax, or $0.47 per diluted share). The 2002 pretax charge included $15 million to close our Berea, Ohio facility, which is included in the Print segment, as well as additional workforce reductions at several other facilities throughout the company. Due to the magnitude of the workforce reductions that occurred in 2002, we recorded a pretax restructuring and impairment charge of $8 million in 2002 within the Corporate segment related to a curtailment loss on our postretirement benefit plan. In addition, we incurred costs in 2002 associated with defined exit activities from previously announced restructuring plans. Restructuring and impairment charges for 2002 by segment were as follows: Print: $55 million; Logistics: $2 million; Financial: $10 million; Corporate: $16 million and Other: $6 million. 2001 included pretax restructuring and impairment charges of $196 million ($137 million after tax, or $1.15 per diluted share). The 2001 pretax charge included $106 million related to various restructuring 26 Table of Contents actions and $90 million related to write downs to adjust the carrying values of certain businesses. During 2001, we announced the closure of four U.S. manufacturing operations within the Print segment and print production at a Financial sales center. In addition, in 2001 we announced the closure of two international operations both included in the Other segment. The $106 million pretax charge for 2001 by segment was as follows: Print: $86 million; Logistics: $1 million; Financial: $8 million; Corporate: $4 million and Other: $7 million. Also during 2001, in accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets to be Disposed of, we recorded a pretax impairment charge of $90 million to adjust the carrying values of certain businesses to fair value. The $90 million pretax charge for 2001 by segment was as follows: Print: $11 million and Other: $79 million. For a further description of restructuring activities and cumulative activity since inception of the restructuring plans, see Note 4, Restructuring and Impairment, to the consolidated financial statements. By product revenues: 2002 included pretax income of $46 million for by product revenues compared with $41 million in 2001. By product revenues are recorded as a reduction in our cost of materials, the majority of which relates to the Print segment. Gain on sale of assets: 2002 included a $7 million pretax gain on the sale of our York, England manufacturing facility following the opening of our newly constructed plant in Flaxby, England, included in the Print segment. Insurance recovery related to 9/11: 2002 included a $2 million pretax gain from the collection of insurance proceeds from claims related to September 11th, included in the Financial segment and recorded as a reduction in our cost of sales. Provision for litigation: 2002 included a $16 million pretax provision for the settlement of certain litigation, included in the Corporate segment. See Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Impact of Goodwill Amortization: As discussed in Note 5, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, to the consolidated financial statements, we adopted SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, as of January 1, 2002. Under SFAS No. 142, goodwill is no longer amortized after the date of adoption of the standard. SFAS No. 142 does not permit the restatement of previously issued financial statements, but does require disclosure of the impact on prior results adjusted to exclude amortization expense related to goodwill and intangible assets which are no longer being amortized. 2001 results included $18 million ($13 million after tax, or $0.11 per diluted share) of goodwill amortization expense. Goodwill amortization expense by segment for 2001 was as follows: Print: $5 million; Logistics: $8 million; Financial: $1 million and Other: $4 million. Pension and postretirement income: 2002 included $20 million pretax pension and postretirement income compared with $36 million of pretax income in 2001. The decline between years is primarily a result of changes in our assumptions for expected returns on plan assets and our discount rate. Affordable housing write downs: 2002 included a pretax charge of $26 million to write down the carrying value of our investments in affordable housing compared with a pretax charge of $8 million in 2001. The write downs reflected declines in the underlying estimated fair value of our affordable housing investments and were included in the Corporate segment. Gain on sale of businesses and investments: 2002 included a $6 million pretax gain from the collection of a note receivable that had been previously reserved in connection with the sale of our investment in MMI in 1999, which was included in the Corporate segment. 2001 included a pretax gain of $7 million related to the sale of our remaining interest in Stream and was included in the Other segment. 27 Table of Contents Other investment write downs: 2001 included a pretax loss of $19 million on the write down of several Internet technology related investments and was included in the Other segment. COLI related expenses upon policy surrender: 2002 included a $5 million pretax charge for expenses related to the surrender of certain corporate owned life insurance (COLI) policies in conjunction with our settlement with the IRS for disputed COLI deductions; see Note 10, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Tax benefit: 2002 included an after tax benefit of $30 million from the settlement with the IRS on COLI; see Note 10, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements for further information. Results of Operations 2002 compared with 2001 Consolidated net sales decreased $543 million, or 10.2%, to $4.8 billion compared with $5.3 billion in 2001, driven by the decline in net sales of our Print segment of 11.8%. Net sales of our Logistics segment were up 1.1% between years, with an 8.3% increase in net sales for the package logistics business partially offset by a decrease of 7.8% in net sales from print logistics. Consolidated value added revenue decreased $244 million, or 8.1%, to $2.8 billion compared with $3.0 billion in 2001, primarily driven by the decline in value added revenue of our Print segment of 8.4%. Our Print segments percentage decline in value added revenue was less than the decline in net sales, primarily due to higher customer furnished paper and improved material yield during 2002. In addition, value added revenue is affected by the price of by product paper we sell. Income from the sale of by products is recorded as a reduction in cost of materials. During 2002, we recognized a reduction in cost of materials of $46 million from by product revenues, compared with $41 million a year ago. Value added revenue of our Logistics segment increased 11.3% between years, due to a 21.2% increase in value added revenue for package logistics. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales (gross margin) was 18.2% in 2002 compared with 17.2% in 2001, primarily due to higher gross margins within our Print segment, partially offset by the net effect of several significant items within the Corporate segment. Our Print segments gross margin in 2002 benefited from restructuring and productivity gains, the impact of lower goodwill amortization ($5 million), higher by product revenues ($5 million) and gain on sale of assets ($7 million), which more than offset the gross margin impact from lower net sales. Our Logistics segments gross margin increased between years, driven by the improved performance of both package and print logistics, and lower goodwill amortization ($8 million). Negatively impacting gross margin in 2002 within the Corporate segment was a provision for litigation ($16 million), partially offset by a lower LIFO provision ($8 million). Selling and administrative expenses decreased $34 million, or 6.0%, to $534 million compared with $568 million in 2001. Reductions in volume based sales incentives (commissions), restructuring savings from workforce reductions, lower bad debt expense ($11 million), and lower spending to build complementary businesses ($16 million) in 2002 were partially offset by higher management incentive compensation expense ($5 million), higher expenses to build marketing capabilities ($8 million) and higher benefit expenses, including medical, pension and postretirement benefit costs. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales was 11.2% in 2002 compared with 10.7% in 2001. Net interest expense decreased 11.8% to $63 million in 2002, primarily due to lower effective interest rates on outstanding debt. Other expense, net, was $6 million in 2002 compared with $1 million in 2001. The primary components of other expense, net, in 2002 were as follows: affordable housing write downs ($26 million) and foreign currency transaction losses, net ($3 million), partially offset by earnings from investments ($6 million), gain on sale of businesses and investments ($6 million) and other miscellaneous income ($11 million). The primary components of other expense, net, in 2001 were as follows: other investment write downs ($19 million); 28 Table of Contents affordable housing write downs ($8 million) and foreign currency transaction losses, net, ($5 million), partially offset by gain on sale of businesses and investments ($7 million) and other miscellaneous income ($24 million). Earnings before income taxes in 2002 were $176 million compared with $75 million in 2001. Earnings before income taxes included $89 million and $196 million in restructuring and impairment charges for 2002 and 2001, respectively, and the other significant items affecting comparability as noted above. The effective tax rate in 2002 was 19.1% compared with 66.6% in 2001. The 2002 effective tax rate included a $30 million tax benefit related to our settlement with the IRS surrounding our COLI program (see Note 10, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements); in 2001, certain one time items included in net income did not have an associated income tax provision or benefit. Net income was $142 million, up $117 million from $25 million in 2001. Diluted earnings per share of $1.24 increased $1.03 from $0.21 in 2001.

Other international locations are included within the respective end markets. Operating results by business segment for 2002 compared with 2001 are as follows: Print Segment The following table summarizes significant items affecting comparability within the Print segment: 2002 2001 Earnings (loss) beforeIncome Taxes Thousands of dollars As reported $ 315,593 $ 283,636 Included in earnings from operations: Restructuring and impairment charges $ (54,645 ) $ (97,222 ) By product revenues 40,266 34,847 Gain on sale of assets 6,943 Goodwill amortization (4,621 ) Total items affecting comparability $ (7,436 ) $ (66,996 ) Net sales for our Print segment decreased $413 million in 2002, or 11.8%, from 2001. Net sales in Magazines, Catalogs and Retail decreased 15.5% between years, which primarily reflected volume decreases and price deterioration across all major markets. The continued economic slowdown during 2002 resulted in lower volumes 30 Table of Contents and more customer bankruptcies within the Catalog and Retail markets, and lower advertising pages for both trade and consumer magazines. The net sales decline in Premedia was driven by these same factors. Depressed volumes in these markets drove increased competition and pricing pressures, and certain customer work lost due to bankruptcy or other factors was replaced with lower priced work. Net sales in our Book business were relatively flat between years due to volume decreases in the religious and specialty markets and more customer furnished paper, offset by volume increases in the consumer and education markets. Net sales for Telecommunications were down 12.6% between years, primarily due to a shift to more customer furnished paper. Value added revenue for our Print segment decreased $179 million, or 8.4%, from 2001, primarily due to volume declines and price deterioration within the Magazines, Catalogs and Retail markets, as well as Premedia. Value added revenue for Magazines, Catalogs and Retail and Premedia declined 14.1% and 14.5%, respectively, between years, consistent with the declines in net sales. Value added revenue for Book increased 2.3% compared with 2001 due to increases in the consumer and educational markets, partially offset by declines in the religious and specialty markets. Value added revenue for Telecommunications decreased 1.9% between years, which was less than the percentage decline in net sales, because the decline in net sales due to more customer furnished paper had no significant impact on value added revenue, as well as improved material yield. Earnings from operations for our Print segment increased $36 million, or 13.5% from 2001. Earnings from operations included $55 million and $97 million of restructuring and impairment charges for 2002 and 2001, respectively. Earnings from operations in 2002 continued to be negatively affected by the slowdown in the U.S. economy, particularly in Magazines, Catalogs and Retail. During 2001, we announced actions to better align our cost structure that included the closing of four print facilities within our Print segment. All four of these print facilities, along with our Berea, Ohio printing facility, were closed by the end of the second quarter of 2002 (see discussion under the caption Restructuring, Impairment and Other Items below). The 2002 impact of productivity initiatives and savings from actions we took to restructure our operations largely offset the effects of volume declines and price erosion on earnings from operations. Also included in earnings from operations in 2002 were lower corporate assessments ($10 million) and lower selling and administrative expenses ($7 million) due to a decrease in management incentive compensation and reduced volume based selling incentives. Logistics Segment The following table summarizes significant items affecting comparability within the Logistics segment: 2002 2001 Earnings (loss) beforeIncome Taxes Thousands of dollars As reported $ 11,049 $ (4,266 ) Included in earnings from operations: Restructuring and impairment charges $ (2,349 ) $ (672 ) Goodwill amortization (8,160 ) Total items affecting comparability $ (2,349 ) $ (8,832 ) Net sales for our Logistics segment increased $9 million, or 1.1%, from a year ago. Net sales of print logistics were down 7.8% for 2002, driven by lower volumes from a continued slow economy. Net sales of package logistics were up 8.3% between years. Unit volumes for package logistics were up 26.1% between years, which were partially offset by a mix change toward lighter weight, lower priced packages. Net sales for 2002 for package logistics were also impacted by our decision to cease serving several large mailers during 2001 because of price levels that proved unprofitable. 31 Table of Contents Value added revenue for our Logistics segment increased $19 million, or 11.3%, from 2001. Value added revenue for package logistics increased 21.2% between years, driven by increased postage discounts due to deeper penetration of the postal system (closer to the final destination) and lower per unit transportation costs. Results for package logistics in 2001 were hurt by a higher relative level of large mailers at price levels that proved to be unprofitable. Actions taken throughout 2001 to raise prices and adjust work mix had a positive impact on package logistics value added revenue in 2002. Value added revenue for print logistics was flat between years, primarily due to a reduction in per unit transportation costs driven by operational efficiencies and improved vendor management, which offset volume declines. Earnings from operations for 2002 for our Logistics segment were $11 million compared with a loss from operations of $5 million a year ago. This improved performance was driven by higher value added revenue from the package logistics business due to the factors noted above, along with lower goodwill amortization of $8 million. Earnings from operations for the print logistics business increased between years as a result of transportation cost savings noted above, and improved margins in 2002 following start up problems in a distribution center in the Northeast during the fourth quarter of 2000 that continued into early 2001. Earnings from operations in 2002 also benefited from the shutdown of package logistics former headquarters in Minneapolis, Minnesota in mid 2001. Financial Segment The following table summarizes significant items affecting comparability within the Financial segment: 2002 2001 Earnings (loss) beforeIncome Taxes Thousands of dollars As reported $ (31,544 ) $ (32,200 ) Included in earnings from operations: Restructuring and impairment charges $ (10,499 ) $ (8,261 ) By product revenues 1,313 1,398 Insurance recovery related to 9/11 1,600 Goodwill amortization (1,323 ) Total items affecting comparability $ (7,586 ) $ (8,186 ) Net sales for our Financial segment decreased $66 million in 2002, or 13.4%, from a year ago, driven by the slowdown in the global capital markets, particularly during the second and third quarters of 2002. Net sales in 2002 from capital markets were down 19.3% between years, driven by lower net sales from domestic capital markets of 18.4%. Net sales in 2002 from international capital markets, though a smaller percentage of total capital markets net sales, were down 24.3% between years. Net sales from customized communications solutions decreased 4.2% between years, driven by a decline in investor communications (e.g., prospectuses, annual and semi annual mutual funds statements) of 4.8%. Value added revenue for our Financial segment decreased $53 million in 2002, or 12.8%, from a year ago, driven by the net sales decline noted above, offset slightly by a reduction in material costs during 2002 due to a shift to more composition and fulfillment work. The loss from operations for our Financial segment in 2002 was $33 million, the same as in the prior year. The loss from operations in 2002 included $10 million of restructuring and impairment charges, compared with $8 million of restructuring and impairment charges in 2001. 2002 also included a benefit of $2 million from an insurance recovery related to September 11, as well as lower goodwill amortization expense between years of $1 million. The impact of restructuring savings and cost reduction actions helped to mitigate the effect of lower sales volumes in 2002. 32 Table of Contents Other and Corporate Segments The following table summarizes significant items affecting comparability within the Other and Corporate segments: 2002 2001 Earnings (loss) beforeIncome Taxes Thousands of dollars As reported $ (119,365 ) $ (172,276 ) Included in earnings from operations: Restructuring and impairment charges $ (21,436 ) $ (89,390 ) By product revenues 4,514 4,719 Goodwill amortization (1,988 ) Provision for litigation (16,000 ) LIFO benefit (provision) 4,800 (3,500 ) Pension and postretirement income (1) 19,907 36,034 (8,215 ) (54,125 ) Included in other income (expense): Gain on sale of businesses and investments 6,350 6,641 Other investment write downs (18,536 ) Affordable housing investment write downs (26,000 ) (8,400 ) Goodwill amortization (1,491 ) COLI related expenses upon policy surrender (4,520 ) (24,170 ) (21,786 ) Included in tax benefit (provision): Tax benefit 30,000 Total items affecting comparability $ (2,385 ) $ (75,911 ) (1) Excludes service costs, which are recorded primarily in the Print, Logistics and Financial segments. 2002 net sales for Direct Mail were down 22.6% between years, due to lower prices, unfavorable work mix and more customer furnished paper. 2002 net sales for International were down $28 million between years due to declines in Latin America driven by lower volumes and the effects of foreign currency devaluation, partially offset by increases in Europe and China. The decrease in value added revenue in 2002 for both Direct Mail and International was attributable to the declines in net sales noted above. The loss from operations for the Other segment was $27 million in 2002 compared with a loss of $135 million in 2001. Of the $108 million improvement in operating results between years, $80 million related to lower restructuring and impairment charges and $16 million for lower spending on complementary businesses. Spending on complementary businesses in 2001 related primarily to Red Rover Digital, a provider of Internet web site design services, which was shut down during the fourth quarter of 2001. Direct Mails loss from operations decreased between years due to lower restructuring and impairment charges, lower goodwill amortization, savings from previous restructuring actions and higher productivity that more than offset the impact of lower net sales. Internationals loss from operations decreased in 2002 primarily due to lower restructuring and impairment charges and related cost savings in Latin America, partially offset by higher start up costs for our facility in Shanghai, China ($6 million). The loss from operations for the Corporate segment was $10 million in 2002 compared with earnings from operations of $51 million in 2001. The change between years of $61 million in the Corporate segment was due to 33 Table of Contents the following: higher restructuring and impairment charges ($12 million); additional provision for litigation ($16 million); lower benefit plan earnings (excluding service costs allocated to the segments) ($11 million); higher corporate staff expenses ($9 million); lower corporate expense allocations ($19 million) and higher miscellaneous expenses ($2 million), partially offset by a lower LIFO provision ($8 million). For a reconciliation of earnings from operations to earnings before income taxes by segment, see Note 18, Industry Segment Information, to the consolidated financial statements. Restructuring and Impairment and Other Items The following discussion should be read in conjunction with Note 4, Restructuring and Impairment, to the consolidated financial statements. As part of our efforts to build a more effective print platform, we continually assess each plants scale of operations and geographic location relative to our entire print platform. We also regularly assess our manufacturing platforms to assure that they are efficient, flexible and aligned properly with our customers needs. During 2003, we recorded pretax restructuring and impairment charges of $16 million ($13 million after tax or $0.12 per diluted share). The 2003 pretax charge included costs associated with newly announced consolidations and workforce reductions, and costs associated with defined exit activities from previously announced restructuring plans. Included were impairment charges of $7 million ($7 million after tax or $0.06 per diluted share) related to the closure of a directory plant in Chile ($3 million) and a write down of goodwill within the Logistics segment ($4 million). During 2002, we recorded pretax restructuring and impairment charges of $89 million ($54 million after tax, or $0.47 per diluted share). The 2002 pretax charge included $15 million related to the shutdown of our Berea, Ohio plant which produced short run specialty magazines and was included within the Print segment. The total 2002 pretax charge was comprised of the following: employee termination benefits related to additional workforce reductions ($37 million); a curtailment loss related to postretirement benefit plans ($8 million); exit costs related to closed facilities ($6 million); relocation costs for defined exit activities which were expensed as incurred ($22 million) and asset impairments to reduce the carrying values of assets held for disposal to fair value ($16 million). During 2001, we recorded pretax restructuring and impairment charges of $196 million ($137 million after tax, or $1.15 per diluted share). Of the total $196 million pretax charge, $106 million related to various restructuring actions announced during 2001, and $90 million related to write downs to adjust the carrying values of certain businesses to fair value. In 2001, we announced the closure of the following five U.S. manufacturing facilities: St. Petersburg and South Daytona, Florida; Des Moines, Iowa; Old Saybrook, Connecticut; and print production only at a Financial segments sales center in Houston, Texas. Each of these print facilities lacked the necessary scale and geographic location to remain competitive. All continuing customer work produced at these facilities was transferred to other company facilities once necessary expansions to accommodate the new work were complete. The South Daytona, Florida, facility was sold in the third quarter of 2003. In addition to the five U.S. manufacturing facilities, we closed two additional facilities in 2001 outside of the U.S. due to sales shortfalls from acquisition plans and to streamline costs: Ediciones Eclipse S.A. de C.V. (Eclipse) in Mexico and Hamburg Gr&aacute;fica Editora (Hamburg) in Brazil. Eclipse was sold in the fourth quarter of 2002 and Hamburg was sold in the second quarter of 2003. During 2001, in accordance with SFAS No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets to Be Disposed Of, we recorded a pretax impairment charge of $90 million to adjust the carrying values of certain of our businesses to fair value. This included write downs with respect to the Print segment (Berea, Ohio: $11 million) and the Other segment: Direct Mail (Newark, Ohio: $37 million), and International including Argentina (Atl&aacute;ntida Cochrane: $19 million); Brazil (Circulo do Livro and Hamburg Gr&aacute;fica Editora: $11 million); and Mexico (Eclipse: $12 million). The pretax impairment charge of $90 million reduced goodwill 34 Table of Contents by $36 million and property and equipment by $54 million. The write downs were primarily the result of the deterioration in net sales from the original acquisition plans, such that the carrying values of the entities were not considered to be recoverable. In March 2001, we announced a $300 million upgrade of our print platform, approximately one third of which related to restructuring costs and two thirds of which related to investment in new equipment. This upgrade program included the purchase of seven new presses and two associated binding lines, all of which were placed into service as of December 31, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, cumulative capital expenditures related to this upgrade program were approximately $220 million. During 2003, we realized cost savings from restructuring actions of approximately $46 million, comprised of both incremental cost savings from 2002 on an annualized basis and from additional actions we took in 2003. We realized cost savings in 2003 of approximately $6 million from lower salary and employee benefit related expenses associated with workforce reductions during 2003. The impact on depreciation expense in 2003 following impairment charges of $3 million for property, plant and equipment related to the closing of the Chile directory plant in the fourth quarter of 2003 was not material. We also realized, as expected, approximately $40 million in incremental cost savings in 2003 from restructuring and impairment charges that we recorded during 2002. As the two largest plant closures announced in 2001 (Old Saybrook, Connecticut, and Des Moines, Iowa, both included in our Print segment) did not cease operations until the second quarter of 2002, we realized additional benefits on an annualized basis in 2003 compared with 2002. Of the total $46 million in cost savings during 2003, approximately $40 million related to lower salary and employee benefit related expenses and $6 million related to lower depreciation expense. The approximate breakdown of these cost savings by segment was as follows: Print: $28 million; Financial: $16 million and Other: $2 million. Based on the timing of restructuring and impairment charges recorded in 2003, we expect to recognize an additional $6 million in savings in 2004 consisting primarily of lower salary expense and employee benefit related expenses. The net book value of assets held for disposal at December 31, 2003 was $8 million. The above reductions in our cost structure for 2003 were offset by the impact of price deterioration and a mix shift to work with a lower price per unit during the year. Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Because of our scale, manufacturing experience and strong customer base, we continue to generate strong cash flows from our printing businesses. We plan to use these cash flows to invest in future growth to create value for our shareholders. This includes upgrading our print platform to enable us to better serve our customers in a more cost effective, flexible and efficient manner. Further, it includes building value added services upstream toward our customers and downstream toward the consumer. If we do not have investment opportunities that generate returns above our cost of capital, our philosophy is to return excess cash to shareholders through share repurchase and or dividends, while maintaining our targeted capital structure. Commercial paper is our primary source of short term financing. At December 31, 2003, we had $91 million outstanding in domestic commercial paper borrowings. In addition, at December 31, 2003, we had available two revolving credit facilities with a number of banks totaling $350 million. These facilities provide support for issuing commercial paper and other credit needs. The facilities consist of a short term facility that matures in October 2004 and provides for borrowings of up to $175 million and a long term facility that matures in October 2007 and also provides for borrowings of up to $175 million. We pay an annual commitment fee on the total unused portion of the credit facilities of 0.07% for the short term facility and 0.09% for the long term facility. The facilities bear interest at variable rates based on the current LIBOR rate and the companys credit rating. As of February 20, 2004, there have been no borrowings under these credit facilities. Management believes that cash flow and borrowing capability are sufficient to fund operations and planned capital expenditures of the company for the forseeable future. See related discussion under Expected Impact of Combination with Moore Wallace Incorporated. 35 Table of Contents We address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the limited use of derivative financial instruments. We enter into interest rate swaps to manage our interest costs and exposure to changes in interest rates. In addition, from time to time we enter into forward and option contracts to minimize potential exchange risk and transaction losses from non functional currency denominated borrowings, sales, purchases or expenses. We do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes and we are not a party to leveraged derivatives. During 2001, we entered into interest rate swap agreements to exchange fixed rate for floating rate payments periodically over the life of certain outstanding debt instruments. These swaps have been designated as fair value hedges and were highly effective as of December 31, 2003. During 2002 and 2003 we also entered into various interest rate swap agreements to exchange floating rate for fixed rate payments. See Note 11, Debt Financing and Interest Expense, to the consolidated financial statements for details. As of December 31, 2003, our only off balance sheet financing activities were non cancelable operating lease commitments described in Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. Cash Flows From Operating Activities Cash flow from operations in 2003 was $354 million, a decrease of $55 million from 2002. This decrease was primarily due to an increased investment in operating working capital of $160 million in 2003, partially offset by lower cash payments between years of $119 million related to the COLI settlement (see Note 10, Income Taxes, to the consolidated financial statements). Higher operating working capital in 2003 was driven by an increase of $134 million in accounts receivable between years. Approximately two thirds of this increase related to higher billings late in the fourth quarter of 2003, compared with a year ago, for our Print and Financial segments. This 2003 increase is expected to reverse in the first quarter of 2004. The remaining increase in accounts receivable in 2003 was primarily due to growth of our International business in Europe and Asia, as well as our package logistics business within our Logistics segment. Our cash conversion cycle (days sales outstanding plus days inventory on hand minus days payable outstanding) improved to 35 days compared with 40 days a year ago, primarily due to an increase in days payable outstanding. The ratio of operating working capital to sales* increased slightly to 2.5% in 2003 from 2.2% in 2002, primarily as a result of higher average accounts receivable in 2003. Cash flows from operations decreased by $139 million in 2002, primarily due to the payment of approximately $130 million related to the COLI settlement and lower net income excluding non cash charges in 2002, partially offset by a 2001 tax payment of $62 million for COLI tax liabilities as a result of the settlement of a federal tax audit.  * The operating working capital to sales ratio is defined as a 13 month average of net receivables, net inventories and prepaid expenses minus accounts payable, accrued compensation and other accrued liabilities, divided by 12 month rolling net sales. Cash Flows From Investing Activities Our principal investing activities are capital expenditures to improve the productivity of operations. In 2003, capital expenditures totaled $203 million, a $39 million decrease compared with 2002 spending of $242 million. 2003 spending primarily included investments to create a more efficient print platform to serve our magazine, catalog and retail customers. In addition, we acquired certain net assets of MLI, a Florida based provider of package distribution services, for approximately $17 million in cash. The reduction in capital spending in 2003 between years was primarily due to completion of the construction of the Shanghai, China plant in 2002 and completion of the print platform upgrade announced in 2001. We expect to continue to fund capital expenditures primarily through cash provided by operations. Excluding the impact of our planned acquisition of Moore Wallace, we expect 2004 capital spending to be below $250 million. 36 Table of Contents Acquisitions On November 8, 2003, we entered into a Combination Agreement (Agreement) with Moore Wallace, a leading provider of print management and outsourced communications. Based on the terms of the Agreement, a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of RR Donnelley will acquire each of the outstanding common shares of Moore Wallace for 0.63 of a share of common stock of RR Donnelley. We expect that, upon closing of the transaction, we will issue approximately 100 million shares of RR Donnelley common stock, as well as undertake Moore Wallaces obligations of indebtedness, which were approximately $900 million as of December 31, 2003. The transaction was approved by the Boards of Directors of both RR Donnelley and Moore Wallace, but remains subject to certain closing conditions that include, among others, the receipt of required approval from both companies shareholders and Ontario Superior Court of Justice approval of a plan of arrangement. The transaction is expected to close on February 27, 2004. See related discussion under Expected Impact of Combination with Moore Wallace Incorporated. On March 6, 2003, we acquired certain net assets of MLI, a Florida based provider of package distribution services, for approximately $17 million in cash. MLI operates sortation facilities and a dedicated fleet of vehicles to provide package distribution services. The purchase price has been allocated based on estimated fair values at the date of acquisition and resulted in $16 million of goodwill. Subsequently, we recorded an impairment charge of $4 million for goodwill as a result of the annual impairment review performed under SFAS No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets. We made no business acquisitions in 2002 or 2001. Divestitures In December 2003, we sold our cost basis investment in MultiMedia Live to an unrelated third party purchaser for $2 million in cash. In connection with this transaction, we recorded a pretax gain on sale of $2 million ($1 million after tax, or $0.01 per diluted share). In July 2003, we sold our 25% equity investment in Global Directory Services Company to an unrelated third party purchaser for $23 million in cash. In connection with this transaction, we reduced goodwill by $10 million, which represented the remaining balance of the goodwill that arose at the time of acquisition. We recorded a pretax gain on sale of $4 million ($3 million after tax, or $0.03 per diluted share). In June 2002, we recorded a pretax gain of $6 million ($6 million after tax, or $0.06 per diluted share) upon collection of a note receivable that had been previously reserved in connection with the sale of Modus Media International (MMI) in 1999. In November 2001, we sold our remaining investment in the common stock of Stream for approximately $10 million in cash. We recognized a pretax gain of $7 million ($7 million after tax, or $0.05 per diluted share) from this transaction. Cash Flows From Financing Activities Financing activities include net borrowings, share repurchases and dividend payments. In 2003, our consolidated net debt repayments were $71 million compared with $64 million in 2002. The reduction in debt in 2003 included the repayment of a 7.0% note due January 1, 2003 for $110 million, partially offset by increased commercial paper borrowings. We reduced our debt levels in 2003 despite lower cash generated by operating activities principally through reduced capital spending and lower share repurchase activity in 2003, following the discontinuance of the share repurchase program in January 2002. Share Repurchases We acquired 0.1 million, 0.5 million and 8.8 million shares of our stock in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, for $2 million, $15 million and $248 million, respectively, in privately negotiated or open market transactions. 37 Table of Contents In January 2001, the Board of Directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to $300 million of the companys common stock in privately negotiated or open market transactions. From February 1, 2001 through the expiration date (January 31, 2002), we purchased approximately 8.1 million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately $230 million under this program. Net cash provided by (used for) repurchases of common stock, defined as cash used for share repurchases net of proceeds from stock options exercised, was $16 million in 2003, ($3) million in 2002 and ($250) million in 2001. A summary of the shares outstanding is presented below: 2003 2002 2001 In Thousands of Shares As of December 31 Basic 113,674 113,124 113,122 Dilutive effect 1,963 453 2,069 Total 115,637 113,577 115,191 Full Year Average Basic 113,285 113,060 116,728 Dilutive effect 1,017 1,312 1,770 Total 114,302 114,372 118,498 Dividends Dividends to shareholders totaled $116 million, $111 million and $110 million in 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In 2003, we increased our dividend by 4%, representing our 33rd consecutive annual dividend increase. We have consistently paid a dividend since becoming a public company in 1956. Financial Condition Our financial position remains strong as evidenced by our year end balance sheet. Our total assets in 2003 were $3.1 billion compared with $3.2 billion at the end of 2002. Average invested capital (total debt and equity, computed on a 13 month average) was $1.9 billion at the end of both 2003 and 2002. The return on average invested capital increased to 11.0% in 2003 from 9.4% in 2002. At December 31, 2003, the debt to capital ratio decreased to 49% from 52% in 2002 and year end debt to total market value was 21% compared with 29% in 2002. Market value was determined based on the number of basic shares outstanding multiplied by the per share closing price of our common stock as of the respective year ends. Contractual Cash Obligations and Other Commitments and Contingencies The following table quantifies our future contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003: Payments Due In Total 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter In Thousands Total debt* $ 920,440 $ 175,873 $ 166,892 $ 225,422 $ 858 $ 952 $ 350,443 Operating leases 225,316 57,117 49,938 46,164 31,282 12,755 28,060 Other 106,174 89,113 4,383 3,458 3,458 3,458 2,304 Total $ 1,251,930 $ 322,103 $ 221,213 $ 275,044 $ 35,598 $ 17,165 $ 380,807 * Excludes $8 million related to the fair market value of interest rate swaps as of December 31, 2003 related to debt due in 2006. 38 Table of Contents Other represents contractual obligations for the purchase of property, plant and equipment ($81 million in total) and various outsourced professional services ($25 million in total). We maintain credit facilities in the U.S. and in our international locations that provide support for issuing commercial paper and for meeting the financing needs of our non U.S. operating units. We maintain revolving credit facilities with a group of U.S. and foreign banks that provide for borrowings of up to $350 million, of which $175 million expires in October 2004, and $175 million expires in October 2007. As of December 31, 2003, we had no borrowings under these credit facilities. See related discussion under Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources and Expected Impact of Combination with Moore Wallace Incorporated. As of December 31, 2003, our non U.S. operating units had approximately $205 million in available credit facilities, most of which are uncommitted. There were approximately $74 million in borrowings against these facilities at December 31, 2003, which are included in short term debt on F 3, as appropriate. Other Information Employees As of December 31, 2003, we had approximately 30,000 employees. Approximately 80% of our employees work in the U.S., and approximately 2% of those are covered by collective bargaining agreements. Of the approximately 6,000 people working in our international operations, 33% are covered by collective bargaining agreements as is customary in those locations. Environmental, Health and Safety Our business is subject to various laws and regulations governing employee health and safety and environmental protection. Our policy is to comply with all laws and regulations, and our objective is to create an injury free workplace. We strive to achieve the highest performance standards of environmental performance and employee health and safety within both the printing industry and the manufacturing community. We do not anticipate that compliance with laws and regulations in these areas will have a material adverse effect on our competitive or consolidated financial position. Litigation and Contingent Liabilities For a discussion of certain litigation involving the company, see Note 8, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements. New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued SFAS No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88 and 106, and a revision of FASB Statement No. 132. This standard revises employers disclosures about pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. It does not change the measurement or recognition of those plans required by FASB Statements No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, No. 88, Employers Accounting for Settlements and Curtailments of Defined Benefit Pension Plans and for Termination Benefits, and No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions. The new rules require additional disclosures about the assets, obligations, cash flows and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans. The required information should be provided separately for pension plans and for other postretirement benefit plans. The new disclosures are generally effective for 2003 calendar year end financial statements of public companies, with a delayed effective date for certain disclosures and for foreign plans. See Note 9, Retirement Plans, to the consolidated financial statements for the related disclosures as required under this statement. Adoption of this statement had no material impact on the companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 39 Table of Contents Effective January 1, 2003, the company adopted SFAS No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities, which rescinds Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). SFAS No. 146 requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred, rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan. Examples of costs covered by this statement include lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs that are associated with a restructuring, discontinued operation, plant closing or other exit or disposal activity. Adoption of this statement had no material impact on the companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. As of January 1, 2003, the company adopted the disclosure requirement of SFAS No. 148, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation Transition and Disclosure. This statement amends SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation, to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. In addition, this statement amends the disclosure requirements of SFAS No. 123 to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results. As of December 31, 2003, the company has elected not to change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation. The company continues to account for employee stock options under APB No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, under which the company did not recognize any compensation expense for 2003, 2002 or 2001. See Note 15, Stock and Incentive Programs for Employees, to the consolidated financial statements for the related disclosures required under SFAS No. 148. In April 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 149, Amendment of Statement 133 on Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 149 was issued in order to address some of the implementation issues about interpreting and applying the definition of a derivative, in particular, interpreting the meaning of (1) the phrase an initial net investment that is smaller than would be required for other types of contracts that would be expected to have a similar response to changes in market factors and (2) the term underlying, as well as issues about how to discern the characteristics of a derivative that contains a financing component; incorporate some of the conclusions reached as part of the Derivatives Implementation Group (DIG) process that ultimately made it necessary to amend SFAS No. 133; and align SFAS No. 133 with the decisions that the FASB has reached in other FASB projects dealing with financial instruments. This statement is effective for contracts entered into or modified after June 30, 2003, and is effective for hedging relationships designated after June 30, 2003, except for certain transition and effective dates relating to other amendments that principally resulted from the DIG process. Adoption of this standard had no impact on the companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2003, the FASB issued SFAS No. 150, Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both Liabilities and Equity, which requires certain financial instruments that were previously presented on the consolidated balance sheets as equity to be presented as liabilities. Such instruments include mandatorily redeemable financial instruments and certain options and warrants. SFAS No. 150 is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after May 31, 2003, and otherwise was effective for the company as of July 1, 2003. Adoption of this standard had no impact on the companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Effective July 1, 2003, the company adopted Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 00 21, Accounting For Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables, which establishes criteria for whether revenue on a deliverable can be recognized separately from other deliverables in a multiple deliverable arrangement. The criteria considers whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer, whether the fair value of the delivered item can be reliably determined and the customers right of return for the delivered item. Adoption of this standard had no material impact on the companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In May 2003, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 01 8, Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a Lease, which requires capital lease treatment for arrangements containing an embedded lease, thereby conveying 40 Table of Contents the right to control the use of property, plant or equipment (collectively, property) whether the right to control the use of the property is explicitly or implicitly specified. The right is conveyed if the purchaser (lessee) obtains physical or operational control of the underlying property or takes substantially all of its output. This pronouncement applies prospectively to new or modified arrangements beginning after May 28, 2003. Adoption of this standard had no impact on the companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In November 2002, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others (FIN 45). The Interpretation elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees, including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit. It also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee, the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value, or market value, of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements. The initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. Adoption of this standard had no material impact on the companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In January 2003 and December 2003, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities (FIN 46), and its revision, FIN 46 R, respectively. FIN 46 and FIN 46 R address the consolidation of entities whose equity holders have either not provided sufficient equity at risk to allow the entity to finance its own activities or do not possess certain characteristics of a controlling financial interest. FIN 46 and FIN 46 R require the consolidation of these entities, known as variable interest entities (VIEs), by the primary beneficiary of the entity. The primary beneficiary is the entity, if any, that is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the VIEs activities, entitled to receive a majority of the VIEs residual returns, or both. FIN 46 and FIN 46 R are applicable for financial statements of public entities that have interests in VIEs or potential VIEs referred to as special purpose entities for periods ending after December 15, 2003. Application by public entities for all other types of entities is required in financial statements for periods ending after March 15, 2004. The companys investment in affordable housing and other investments fall into this latter category. The companys risk of loss related to its equity investments, including investments in affordable housing entities, is generally limited to the carrying value of these investments, which was approximately $105 million at December 31, 2003. The company is continuing to evaluate its investments to determine which, if any, will be impacted by the adoption of FIN 46 and FIN 46 R. Adoption of both of these standards is not expected to have a material impact on the companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. On December 17, 2003, the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC or the Staff) issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104 (SAB 104), Revenue Recognition, which amends SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements. SAB 104s primary purpose is to rescind accounting guidance contained in SAB 101 related to multiple element revenue arrangements, superseded as a result of the issuance of EITF 00 21. Additionally, SAB 104 rescinds the SECs Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements Frequently Asked Questions and Answers (the FAQ) issued with SAB 101 that had been codified in SEC Topic 13, Revenue Recognition. Selected portions of the FAQ have been incorporated into SAB 104. While the wording of SAB 104 has changed to reflect the issuance of EITF 00 21, the revenue recognition principles of SAB 101 remain largely unchanged by the issuance of SAB 104. Adoption of this standard had no material impact on the companys financial position, results of operations or cash flows. On December 8, 2003, President Bush signed into law a bill that expands Medicare, primarily adding a prescription drug benefit for Medicare eligible retirees starting in 2006. Under this bill, postretirement plans with prescription drug benefits that are at least actuarially equivalent to the Medicare Part D benefit will be eligible for a 28% subsidy. In response to this bill, on January 12, 2004, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position (FSP) 106 1, Accounting and Disclosure Requirements Related to the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. FSP 106 1 addresses how to incorporate this subsidy into the calculation of the accumulated periodic benefit obligation (APBO) and net periodic postretirement benefit costs, and also allows 41 Table of Contents plan sponsors to defer recognizing the effects of the bill in the accounting for its postretirement plan under SFAS No. 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, until further authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is issued. As the measurement date for the companys postretirement benefit plan is September 30, 2003, the APBO and the net periodic postretirement benefit cost in the financial statements and accompanying notes do not reflect the effects of the bill on the plan. In addition, specific authoritative guidance on the accounting for the federal subsidy is pending, and when issued, could require a change to previously reported information. The company has deferred adoption of this standard, as is allowed under FSP 106 1, until further guidance is issued. Expected Impact of Combination with Moore Wallace Incorporated We expect to complete our planned Combination with Moore Wallace on February 27, 2004 (see Note 3, Acquisitions and Investments, to the consolidated financial statements for a further description of the pending transaction). Upon closing the transaction, a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of RR Donnelley will acquire each of the outstanding shares of Moore Wallace for 0.63 of a share of common stock of RR Donnelley. We expect that, upon closing of the transaction, we will issue approximately 100 million shares of RR Donnelley common stock, as well as undertake Moore Wallaces obligations of indebtedness, which were approximately $900 million at December 31, 2003. The Combination is expected to create the worlds premier full service commercial printer with over $8 billion in annual net sales and approximately 50,000 employees worldwide. The strategy for the combined company will focus on improved returns, lower costs and increased profitability; increased financial strength; and enhanced revenue opportunities. While detailed plans have not yet been finalized, we believe that the Combination will impact operating results in future periods through improved cross selling efforts by providing a total management solution; leveraging product and distribution strengths; aggressive cost reduction efforts, including headcount and facility rationalization; and increased purchasing power with suppliers to reduce costs and increase efficiencies. We cannot predict the effect these actions will have on our results of operations or financial condition. We will account for the Combination with Moore Wallace under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations under accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. Our reported financial condition and results of operations issued after the completion of the transaction will reflect Moore Wallaces balances and results of operations after completion of the transaction, but will not be restated retroactively to reflect the historical financial position or results of operations of Moore Wallace. The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to earnings in the first full year of operations, excluding the impact of transaction related charges. In addition to enhanced revenue opportunities, the combined company expects to generate cost savings of at least $100 million on an annualized basis in the first 12 to 24 months after the closing. These savings are anticipated to result from the elimination of duplicative administrative and infrastructure costs, reduction in procurement expenses and asset rationalization. The combined company is also expected to generate substantial cash flow in the first year of consolidated operations. The combined company expects to maintain an annual dividend, which is currently $1.04 per share. In connection with the Combination, we intend to enter into a new five year, unsecured revolving credit facility of between $850 million and $1 billion. We intend to use this facility for general corporate purposes, including support for issuing commercial paper and letters of credit. This new facility is intended to replace our existing 364 day and five year credit facilities, which mature in October 2004 and October 2007, respectively, as well as to replace a credit facility currently maintained by Moore Wallace. Simultaneously with or immediately following closing of the Combination, we expect to issue commercial paper, supported by the new revolving credit facility of approximately $500 million to $550 million. We intend to use the proceeds of this issuance to retire a portion of Moore Wallaces existing debt, pay fees required to terminate certain Moore Wallace interest rate swaps, pay fees and expenses related to the Combination and related financings, and provide funds for other general corporate purposes. 42 Table of Contents Subsequent to the closing of the Combination, we expect to issue additional long term debt, the proceeds of which we may use to retire a portion of Moore Wallaces existing debt, repay outstanding commercial paper, pay debt repayment or swap termination costs and fees, or provide funds for other general corporate purposes. On February 11, 2004, we entered into two separate treasury rate lock transactions totaling $400 million with two financial institutions in order to effectively lock in a portion of the interest rate on a portion of the expected debt issue. If we do not complete the debt issue as expected before the rate lock transactions expire or are terminated, we may incur significant costs or expenses if interest rates on treasury securities at the time of expiry or termination are less than the contracted transaction rate. While we expect to complete the Combination as currently planned, it is subject to closing conditions. If any of the closing conditions are not met or if the Combination does not close as we currently expect, we may be required to pay additional transaction related and financing costs and fees. Under certain terms specified in the Combination Agreement, we may also be required to pay termination fees and transaction expenses to Moore Wallace of up to $85 million. At December 31, 2003, we had capitalized $3 million of costs related to the Combination that would be charged to expense if the Combination were not completed. Outlook The environment is highly competitive in most of our product categories and geographic regions. Competition is based largely on price, quality and servicing the special needs of customers. Industry analysts believe that there is overcapacity in most commercial printing markets exacerbated by recent drops in market demand. Therefore, competition is intense. Our intent is to differentiate our service offerings so that we are viewed by our customers as a partner that can help them deliver effective and targeted communications in the right format to the right audience at the right time. We are a large user of paper, supplied to us by our customers or bought by us. The cost and supply of certain paper grades used in the manufacturing process will continue to affect our financial results. However, management currently does not foresee any disruptive conditions affecting prices or supply of paper in 2004. Postal costs are a significant component of our customers cost structures and postal rate changes can influence the number of pieces that our customers are willing to mail. Any resulting decline in print volumes mailed could have an effect on our financial results. Postal rates increased in January 2001, July 2001 and July 2002, and the company does not expect postal rate increases to occur until 2006. Postal rate increases can enhance the value of our Logistics segment to our customers, as we are able to improve the cost efficiency of mail processing and distribution. This ability to deliver mail on a more precise schedule and at a lower relative cost should enhance our position in the marketplace. The cost of energy affects our operating costs in our Print segment and transportation costs in our Logistics segment. In our Logistics segment, increases in fuel costs can be offset by fuel surcharges passed on to customers, but continuing increases in these and other energy costs could affect our consolidated financial results. Consumer confidence and economic growth are key drivers of demand for our services. The slowdown experienced in the U.S. and international economies is continuing to affect demand across most of our businesses. Uncertainty in the economy has led customers across most of our end markets to indicate that they anticipate flat demand throughout 2004. In the longer term, technological changes, including the electronic distribution of documents and data and the on line distribution and hosting of media content, present both risks and opportunities for us. Many of our businesses leverage distinctive capabilities to participate in the rapid growth in electronic communications. Our goal remains to help our customers succeed by delivering effective and targeted communications in the right format to the right audiences at the right time. We believe that with our competitive strengths, including our comprehensive service offerings, technology leadership, depth of management experience, customer relationships and economies of scale, we can develop the most valuable solutions for our customers, which should result in increased shareholder value. 43 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. As such, the company monitors the interest rate environment and modifies the components of its debt portfolio as necessary to manage funding costs and interest rate risks. Generally, the company maintains at least half of its debt at fixed rates (approximately 58.7% and 52.6% at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively). Excluded from the calculation of fixed rate debt at both December 31, 2003 and 2002 is $200 million in fixed rate debt that was swapped to floating rates to take advantage of lower interest rates on floating rate debt. The swap was executed in two transactions that mature in November 2006. To reduce its exposure to future increases in floating interest rates, the company entered into additional floating to fixed rate swap agreements, effectively fixing the interest rates for the May 15, 2003 and November 17, 2003 interest rate resets on the original swaps (see Note 14, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements). The companys exposure to adverse changes in foreign exchange rates is immaterial to the consolidated financial statements of the company. The company occasionally uses other financial instruments to hedge exposures to interest rate and foreign exchange rate changes. The company uses derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and not for trading or speculative purposes. For further discussion relating to financial instruments, see Note 14, Financial Instruments, to the consolidated financial statements.
