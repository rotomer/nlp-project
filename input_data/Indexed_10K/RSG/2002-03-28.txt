ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and their Notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 2001 FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES In January 2001, we publicly announced our objectives for the year. These objectives included the following: Increasing free cash flow by 18% to $145 million, or over 60% of net income. Growing revenue by 5%, with 2% from price and 3% from volume. Increasing earnings per share by 6% to $1.36. This objective assumed a V shaped recovery in the economy during the second half of the year. Using free cash flow to enhance shareholder value by completing strategic acquisitions and repurchasing up to $100.0 million of our stock. Maintaining our strong balance sheet evidenced by a debt to total capitalization ratio in the mid to low 40% range. 2001 BUSINESS PERFORMANCE Revenue and operating margins were pressured by falling commodity prices during the first quarter. Our internal growth for the quarter, excluding the impact of commodity prices, was 4.3% with 2.2% coming from price and 2.1% from volume. Higher fuel costs also pressured margins during the quarter. In addition, we strengthened our regional management structure by adding sales, maintenance and operational personnel during this period. This increase in staff resulted in increased selling, general and administrative costs placing further downward pressure on operating margins. During the second quarter of 2001, revenue and operating margins were negatively impacted by continued weakness in commodity prices. In addition, we began to see a slowdown in the manufacturing sector, particularly in the Midwestern and Mid Atlantic states. Our internal growth for the quarter, excluding the negative impact of commodity prices and the positive impact of non core operations, was 5.0% with 2.0% coming from price and 3.0% coming from volume. Higher labor costs also pressured margins during the quarter. During the second quarter, we acquired Richmond Sanitary Services, located in Northern California. Richmond complemented our business platform by providing us with a vertically integrated business in a growth market. During the third quarter of 2001, the economic slowdown began to impact our industrial business servicing the non residential construction industry. Landfill volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity began to weaken. In addition, the slowdown we began to experience in the second quarter in the manufacturing sector became more acute as we began to see significant shift reductions and plant closings in the Southeastern United States, particularly in the textile and home furnishing industries in the Carolinas. These conditions were reflected in our internal growth numbers. Our internal growth for the quarter, excluding the negative impact of commodity prices and the positive impact of non core operations, was 2.1% with 1.6% coming from price and .5% coming from volume. This rate of internal growth was approximately half of what we experienced in prior quarters of 2001. While we continued to be successful in attracting municipal customers, these customers generally produce less revenue and lower margins than other types of customers. Also during the third quarter, operating margins continued to be pressured by lower commodity prices and higher labor costs. Selling, general and administrative costs were also higher due to the previously 21 discussed strengthening of our regional management structure and due to an increase in bad debt expense attributable to the economic slowdown. During the third quarter, we sold $450.0 million of unsecured notes with a coupon rate of 6 3/4% that mature in 2011. This transaction allowed us to secure long term financing at, what we believe, is a very favorable rate. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we continued to see a weakening in waste volumes from the manufacturing sector. We also continued to see a slowdown in commercial construction and special waste activity which resulted in both volume reductions and price sensitivity for these services. Furthermore, we began to see a softening in residential construction activity. As a result, internal growth for the quarter, excluding the negative impact of commodity prices and the positive impact of non core operations, was 2.6% with 1.8% coming from price and .8% coming from volume. Internal growth for all of 2001, excluding the negative impact of commodity prices and the positive impact of non core operations, was 3.4% with 1.9% coming from price and 1.5% coming from volume. Operating margins also weakened during the fourth quarter for the reasons mentioned above. We continued to see medical costs escalate and we began to experience higher costs for risk insurance. We also continued to experience higher labor costs and selling, general and administrative costs due to the strengthening of our regional management structure. In addition, bad debt expense continued to increase as a result of the economic slowdown. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a charge of $86.1 million on an after tax basis, or $132.0 million on a pre tax basis. Included in this charge are the completed and planned divestitures and closings of certain core and non core businesses, asset impairments, downsizing our compost, mulch and soil business and related inventory adjustments, an increase in insurance reserves and an increase in bad debt expense related to the economic slowdown. On a reported basis, including the impact of the charge, our earnings per share for 2001 were $.73. On an adjusted basis, before considering the impact of the charge we recorded during the fourth quarter, our earnings per share were $1.24. While we did not achieve our announced earnings per share objective for 2001 for reasons primarily attributable to the economic slowdown, our free cash flow was $147.0 million or 69% of adjusted net income. Our disciplined approach to managing capital expenditures and our focus on monetizing accounts receivable helped us to exceed our free cash flow objective. Our debt to total capitalization as of December 31, 2001 was 41.3%. During 2001, we used our free cash flow to repurchase 5.6 million shares of our common stock for $99.2 million. In addition, we acquired Richmond Sanitary Services, a fully integrated waste disposal company located in Northern California. 2002 FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES Our financial objectives for 2002 assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter 2001. Specific guidance is as follows: Our goal is to generate $147.0 million in free cash flow. This includes the net impact of the change in accounting for goodwill. The comparable amount in 2001, assuming the change in accounting for goodwill was effective January 1, 2001, would have been $132.0 million. We anticipate using our free cash flow to repurchase shares of our common stock under our $125.0 million share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in October 2001. We anticipate earnings per share of $1.37 to $1.39. This includes the expected decrease in goodwill amortization resulting from the change in accounting for goodwill. We anticipate internal growth from core operations to be 1.5% to 2.0%, approximately 1.0% attributable to price and .5% to 1.0% attributable to volume. 22 BUSINESS INITIATIVES Our business initiatives for 2002 are generally a continuation of those initiated in 2001 and are dependent on standardizing our business processes and improving our systems. Ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and processes and are trained in our new systems is essential to the overall success of our initiatives. Our business initiatives for 2002 are as follows: Improve our revenue. The first step in this process was completed in 2001 and included installing a standardized billing and operating system. This system enables us to, among other things, stratify our customers to determine how our rates compare to current market pricing. During 2002, we expect to implement the second generation of this software which we call RSI 1.0. RSI 1.0 will be our companys core business system providing a variety of functionalities including customer service, dispatch, billing, sales analysis and route productivity analysis. We are in the process of instituting a return on investment pricing model. This model will eventually allow us to track our return on investment by customer. During 2001, we also implemented a customer relationship management system. This system will improve the productivity of our sales force by helping to establish marketing priorities and track sales leads. It also tracks renewal periods for existing and potential commercial, industrial and franchise contracts. Our focus during 2002 will be to ensure our sales force is properly trained on this system and using it as intended. Improve the productivity of our operations. We have instituted a grid productivity program that enables us to benchmark the performance of our drivers. In addition, in our larger markets, we routinely use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and improve operational density. During 2001, we completed a disposal optimization review. This review determines which local disposal option maximizes our return on invested capital and cash flow. Improve fleet management and procurement. In February 2002, we selected Dossier as our fleet management and procurement system. Among other features, this system will track parts inventories, generate automatic quantity order points and log all maintenance work. It will allow us to capture and review information to ensure our preventive maintenance programs comply with manufacturers warranties. In addition, the purchase order module within this system will allow us to cross reference purchasing information with our inventory. We expect to have Dossier implemented at all of our hauling operations by the end of 2002, and we expect to roll this system out to our landfill operations in 2003. Enhance operational and financial reporting systems. We currently have several initiatives underway aimed at improving our operational and financial reporting systems. The overall goal of these initiatives is to provide us with detailed information, prepared in a consistent manner, that will allow us to quickly analyze and act upon trends in our business. The most significant of these systems is our enterprise wide general ledger package. By February 2002, we successfully converted 40% of our locations to Lawson general ledger software. We expect to have the entire company converted to Lawson by the third quarter of 2002. All of the system initiatives mentioned above will provide us with more consistent and detailed information, thus allowing us to make quicker and more informed business decisions. In addition, during 2001 all of our software applications were standardized and centralized at our data center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This standardization and centralization provides us with consolidated information concerning our operations across a variety of operational and financial disciplines. It also significantly enhances our ability to execute our disaster recovery plan, if necessary. Expand our safety training programs. As part of our ongoing emphasis on safe work practices and in light of the recent increase in insurance costs, we are expanding our safety training programs in 2002. We have signed a multi year agreement with DuPont Safety Resources to assist us in successfully completing this initiative. 23 OUR BUSINESS We are a leading provider of non hazardous solid waste collection and disposal services in the United States. We provide solid waste collection services for commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers through 146 collection companies in 22 states. We also own or operate 89 transfer stations, 54 solid waste landfills and 26 recycling facilities. We generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations, and our remaining revenue is from landfill disposal services and other services, including recycling and compost, mulch and soil operations. The following table reflects our total revenue by source for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 (in millions): 2001 2000 1999 Collection: Residential.................... $ 479.7 21.2% $ 434.6 20.6% $ 373.2 20.0% Commercial..................... 686.0 30.4 627.8 29.9 548.4 29.3 Industrial..................... 509.6 22.6 486.5 23.1 432.8 23.1 Other.......................... 47.5 2.1 47.6 2.3 50.0 2.7 Total collection....... 1,722.8 76.3 1,596.5 75.9 1,404.4 75.1 Transfer and disposal............ 780.8 717.4 546.3 Less: Intercompany...............

Our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers. Our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on long term contracts with municipalities. We generally provide industrial and commercial collection operations to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years. Our revenue from landfill operations is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties. In general, we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials. No one customer has individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue in any of the last three years. During 2001, our largest customer comprised less than 1% of our consolidated revenue and our largest municipal franchise comprised less than 4%. The cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes disposal, labor, fuel and equipment maintenance costs. We try to be more efficient by controlling the movement of waste streams from the point of collection through disposal. During the three months ended December 31, 2001, approximately 52% of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate. Our landfill cost of operations includes daily operating expenses, costs of capital for cell development, accruals for closure and post closure costs, and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance. We expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred. We use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs. In life cycle accounting, certain direct costs are capitalized or accrued and charged to expense based upon the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. These costs include all costs to acquire, construct, close and maintain a site during the post closure period. Cost and airspace estimates are developed annually by independent engineers together with our engineers. These estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to annually adjust our rates used to expense capitalized costs and accrue closure and post closure costs. Changes in these estimates 24 primarily relate to changes in available airspace, inflation rates and applicable regulations. Changes in available airspace include changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas deemed likely to be permitted. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management. In 1999, we significantly expanded our accounting disclosures in a number of areas that require subjective or complex judgments including landfill accounting, fixed assets and the activity in various balance sheet accounts such as closure and post closure accruals, insurance reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts. As part of our continuing commitment to reliable and transparent financial reporting that allows the users of our financial statements to make more informed decisions, we have prepared the following list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain.

We use an estimate of the undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the assets in assessing their recoverability. We measure impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS We make decisions to acquire or invest in businesses based on financial and strategic considerations. We have included businesses that we acquired and which have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. We acquired various solid waste businesses during the year ended December 31, 2001, which were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. The aggregate purchase price we paid for these transactions was $287.7 million. The aggregate purchase price paid, less cash and restricted cash acquired plus debt assumed, was $247.5 million. In July 1999, we entered into a definitive agreement with Allied Waste Industries to acquire certain solid waste assets. In 2000, we had completed the purchase of these assets for approximately $105.5 million in cash, $85.8 million of which were acquired during 2000. In October 1999, we entered into a definitive agreement with Allied for the simultaneous purchase and sale of certain other solid waste assets. In 2000, we and Allied had completed the purchase and sale of these assets for which annual revenue was approximately $145.0 million. Our net proceeds from the cash portion of the exchange of assets were $30.7 million. All of these transactions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. In September 1998, we signed an agreement with Waste Management to acquire assets and to enter into disposal agreements at various Waste Management facilities. By June 1999, we had completed the purchase of the assets for approximately $479.6 million in cash plus properties, $292.7 million of which were acquired during the six months ended June 30, 1999. The assets purchased included 16 landfills, 11 transfer stations and 136 commercial collection routes across the United States, and were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. In addition to the acquisitions from Allied and Waste Management, we also acquired various other solid waste businesses during the years ended December 31, 2000 and 1999, which were accounted for under the 30 purchase method of accounting. The aggregate purchase price we paid in these transactions was $102.5 million and $430.8 million in cash, respectively. Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for 2001 acquisitions totaled approximately $223.3 million. As of December 31, 2001 we had intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,551.6 million, which consist primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired. We amortize cost in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over forty years on a straight line basis. As of December 31, 2001, the amortization expense associated with these intangible assets on an annualized basis is approximately $48.5 million. We believe the forty year life assigned to the cost in excess of the fair value of net assets acquired is reasonable as the businesses we acquired are generally well established companies which have been in existence for many years and have stable, long term customer relationships. During 2001, $62.6 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace. As of December 31, 2001, we had $958.8 million of landfill development costs which includes purchase price allocated to landfill airspace as well as other capitalized landfill costs. If multiple entities are included in an acquisition, purchase price is allocated to airspace based upon the discounted expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within the acquired group and is adjusted for other non depletable landfill assets and liabilities acquired (primarily closure and post closure liabilities). Landfill purchase price is amortized using the units of consumption method over total available airspace which includes likely to be permitted airspace where appropriate. Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for 2000 acquisitions totaled approximately $253.4 million. As of December 31, 2000, we had intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,435.0 million, which consist primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired. In addition, during 2000, $30.9 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions was allocated to landfill airspace. Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for 1999 acquisitions totaled approximately $419.3 million. As of December 31, 1999, we had intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,297.3 million, which consist primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired. In addition, during 1999, $328.8 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions was allocated to landfill airspace. See Note 3, Business Combinations, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements, for further discussion of business combinations. BACKGROUND In May 1998, AutoNation announced its intention to separate our company, which at the time was a wholly owned subsidiary of AutoNation, from AutoNation, and for our company to complete an initial public offering of common stock. As a result, we entered into certain agreements with AutoNation providing for the separation and governing various interim and ongoing relationships between our company and AutoNation. In addition, our outstanding shares of common stock held by AutoNation were recapitalized into 95.7 million shares. In July 1998, we completed an initial public offering resulting in net proceeds of approximately $1.4 billion. In addition, in July 1998 we repaid in full amounts due to AutoNation as of June 30, 1998 through the issuance of 16.5 million shares of our common stock and through the payment of all proceeds from our initial public offering. In May 1999, we completed a secondary offering in which AutoNation sold substantially all of our common stock it owned. We received no proceeds in the secondary offering. AutoNation provided our company with the services of a number of its executives and employees. In consideration for these services, AutoNation allocated to our company a portion of its general and administrative costs related to these services. In January 1999, we entered into a services agreement with AutoNation under which AutoNation agreed to continue to provide various general and administrative services to our company in exchange for a monthly fee of $0.9 million. The services agreement expired on June 30, 1999. Our management believes that the amounts allocated to our company and or charged under 31 the services agreement were no less favorable to our company than costs we would have incurred to obtain such services on our own or from unaffiliated third parties. We recorded other charges of $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. These costs relate to our separation from AutoNation. They consist of $2.0 million of compensation expense related to the granting of certain replacement employee stock options at exercise prices below the quoted market price of our common stock at the date of grant. See Note 8, Stock Options, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. They also consist of $4.9 million of other additional charges directly related to our separation. The 1999 historical consolidated financial information included in this Annual Report on Form 10 K does not necessarily reflect what our financial position and results of operations would have been had we been operated as a separate, stand alone entity during this period. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years Ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 Our net income was $125.5 million for the year ended December 31, 2001, as compared to $221.0 million in 2000 and $200.8 million in 1999. Our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 include other charges described below. The following table summarizes our costs and expenses in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue for 1999 through 2001: 2001 2000 1999 $ % $ % $ % Revenue.................................... $2,257.5 100.0% $2,103.3 100.0% $1,869.3 100.0% Cost of operations......................... 1,422.5 63.0 1,271.3 60.5 1,131.9 60.5 Depreciation, amortization and depletion of property and equipment................... 168.3 7.4 157.0 7.5 130.3 7.0 Amortization of intangible assets.......... 47.1 2.1 40.4 1.9 32.9 1.7 Selling, general and administrative expenses................................. 236.5 10.5 193.9 9.2 176.7 9.5 Other charges.............................. 99.6 4.4 6.7 .3 6.9 .4 Operating income....................... $ 283.5 12.6% $ 434.0 20.6% $ 390.6 20.9% Revenue. Revenue was $2,257.5 million, $2,103.3 million and $1,869.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Revenue increased by $154.2 million, or 7.3%, from 2000 to 2001. Revenue increased by $234.0 million, or 12.5%, from 1999 to 2000. The following table reflects the components of our revenue growth for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999: 2001 2000 1999 Price............................................... .8% 2.5% 2.3% Volume.............................................. 2.3 3.5 5.8 Total internal growth..................... 3.1 6.0 8.1 Acquisitions........................................ 4.2 6.5 27.9 Total revenue growth...................... 7.3% 12.5% 36.0% Price growth for the year ended December 31, 2001 was negatively impacted by declining commodity prices. Excluding the negative effect of commodity prices, price growth was 1.9% for the year ended December 31, 2001. In addition, non core operations increased volume growth during the year ended December 31, 2001. Excluding the positive impact of non core operations, volume growth was 1.5% for the year ended December 31, 2001. As such, adjusted internal growth for the year ended December 31, 2001 was 3.4%. 32 During the first and second quarters of 2001, our revenue was negatively impacted by continued weakness in commodity prices. In addition, during the second quarter of 2001, we began to see a slowdown in revenue from the manufacturing sector, particularly in the Midwestern and Mid Atlantic states. During the third quarter of 2001, the economic slowdown began to impact our industrial business servicing the non residential construction industry. Landfill volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity began to weaken. In addition, the slowdown we began to experience in the second quarter in the manufacturing sector became more acute as we began to see significant shift reductions and plant closings in the Southeastern United States, particularly in the textile and home furnishing industries in the Carolinas. These conditions were reflected in our internal growth numbers, which were approximately half of what we experienced in prior quarters. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we continued to see a weakening in waste volumes from the manufacturing sector. We also continued to see a slowdown in commercial construction and special waste activity which resulted in both volume reductions and price sensitivity for these services. Furthermore, we began to see a softening in residential construction activity. Our price and volume growth rates may decline in 2002 depending upon the severity and duration of the economic slowdown. Cost of Operations. Cost of operations was $1,422.5 million, $1,271.3 million and $1,131.9 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 63.0%, 60.5% and 60.5%, for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in aggregate dollars from 1999 to 2000 is a result of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth. Cost of operations as a percentage of revenue remained constant from 1999 to 2000 because improved operating efficiencies and an increase in higher margin landfill operations primarily due to acquisitions were offset by higher fuel and labor costs. The increase in aggregate dollars from 2000 to 2001 is primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a charge of $86.1 million on an after tax basis, or $132.0 million on a pre tax basis. Of this pre tax amount, $24.2 million was recorded to cost of operations which relates primarily to the downsizing of our compost, mulch and soil business and related inventory adjustments and an increase in insurance reserves. Excluding the impact of this charge, cost of operations for 2001 was $1,398.3 million or 61.9% as a percent of revenue. The increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from 2000 to 2001 is primarily a result of the economic slowdown, lower commodity prices, higher labor costs and higher costs for risk and health insurance partially offset by improved operating efficiencies and revenue mix. In addition, during 2001 we continued to be successful in attracting municipal customers; however, these customers generally produce less revenue and lower margins than other customers. We believe that cost of operations as a percentage of revenue may continue to remain high or increase further depending upon the severity and duration of the economic slowdown. Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion of Property and Equipment. Depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were $168.3 million, $157.0 million and $130.3 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 7.4%, 7.5% and 7.0%, for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in aggregate dollars for all periods presented and the increase as a percentage of revenue from 1999 to 2000 are primarily due to acquisitions and capital expenditures. The decrease as a percentage of revenue from 2000 to 2001 is primarily due to lower depletion expense at our landfills resulting from higher compaction and more cost efficient cell construction. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Expenses for amortization of intangible assets were $47.1 million, $40.4 million and $32.9 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 2.1%, 1.9% and 1.7% for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to an increase in the aggregate dollar amount of acquisitions accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. 33 Intangible assets consist primarily of cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired, but also includes values assigned to long term contracts and covenants not to compete. Commencing January 1, 2002, cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired is no longer required to be amortized. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $236.5 million, $193.9 million and $176.7 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 10.5%, 9.2% and 9.5%, for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increases in aggregate dollars are primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth. The decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from 1999 to 2000 is primarily due to applying our existing overhead structure over an expanding revenue base. Included in selling, general and administrative expenses are fees paid to AutoNation under the services agreement of $5.3 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. See Note 12, Related Party Transactions, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a charge of $86.1 million on an after tax basis, or $132.0 million on a pre tax basis. Of this pre tax amount, $8.2 million was recorded to selling, general and administrative expenses which relates primarily to an increase in bad debt expense resulting from the economic slowdown. Excluding the impact of this charge, selling, general and administrative expenses for 2001 are $228.3 million or 10.1% as a percent of revenue. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to the strengthening of our regional management structure and various systems and training initiatives. We believe that selling, general and administrative expenses in the range of 10% of revenue is appropriate for 2002 given our business platform. However, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue may increase depending upon the severity and duration of the economic slowdown. Other Charges. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a charge of $86.1 million on an after tax basis, or $132.0 million on a pre tax basis. Of this pre tax amount, $99.6 million was recorded to other charges which relates primarily to completed and planned divestitures and closings of certain core and non core businesses and asset impairments. Other charges were $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. These charges relate primarily to the early closure of a landfill in south Texas. We recorded other charges of $6.9 million for the year ended December 31, 1999. These charges relate to our separation from AutoNation. They include $2.0 million of compensation expense related to the granting of certain replacement employee stock options at exercise prices below the quoted market price of our common stock at the date of grant. See Note 8, Stock Options, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. They also include $4.9 million of other additional charges directly related to our separation. Operating Income. Operating income was $283.5 million, $434.0 million and $390.6 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 12.6%, 20.6% and 20.9%, for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Excluding the impact of the charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001, our operating income was $415.5 or 18.4% as a percentage of revenue. Interest Expense. We incurred interest expense on our revolving credit facility, unsecured notes and tax exempt bonds. Interest expense was $80.1 million, $81.6 million and $64.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in interest expense from 1999 to 2000 is primarily due to an increase in average debt balances. The increase is also due to a general market increase in interest rates starting in the third quarter of 1999. The decrease in interest expense from 2000 to 2001 is due to a general market decrease in interest rates and an increase in tax exempt financings which generally bear interest at lower rates than our revolving credit facility and unsecured notes. The decrease in interest expense is also due to interest rate swap agreements that we entered into in September 2001. Capitalized interest was $3.3 million, $2.9 million and $5.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. 34 Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net. Interest and other income, net of other expense, was $5.9 million, $4.0 million and $.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The variances during the periods are primarily due to fluctuations in cash balances on hand and related interest income and net gains on the disposition of assets during 2000 and 2001. The amount recorded for the year ended December 31, 1999 includes a $2.9 million loss on the sale of our collection and disposal business in Costa Rica. Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes was $83.8 million, $135.4 million and $125.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Our effective income tax rate was 40.0%, 38.0%, and 38.5% for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate from 2000 to 2001 is the result of certain non tax deductible items included in the charge that we recorded during the fourth quarter of 2001. Excluding the impact of this charge, our effective tax rate for 2001 was 38.0%. ADJUSTED CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Our adjusted net income was $211.6 million, or $1.24 per share, for the year ended December 31, 2001. Our adjusted operating results exclude an $86.1 million after tax charge we recorded during the fourth quarter of 2001. This charge relates primarily to completed and planned divestitures and closings of certain core and non core businesses, asset impairments, downsizing our compost, mulch and soil business and related inventory adjustments, an increase in insurance reserves and an increase in bad debt expense associated with the economic slowdown. The following table reflects our consolidated results of operations as reported in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2001, adjusted to exclude the charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 (in millions, except per share data): UNAUDITED REPORTED ADJUSTMENTS ADJUSTED Revenue................................................ $2,257.5 $ $2,257.5 Expenses: Cost of operations................................... 1,422.5 (24.2) 1,398.3 Depreciation, amortization and depletion............. 215.4 215.4 Selling, general and administrative.................. 236.5 (8.2) 228.3 Other charges........................................ 99.6 (99.6) Operating income....................................... 283.5 132.0 415.5 Interest expense.......................................

We recorded a $24.2 million charge to cost of operations during the fourth quarter of 2001. This charge included a $13.3 million write down associated with the downsizing of our composting, mulch and soil business. The remainder of this charge consists primarily of an increase in insurance reserves. 35 We recorded an $8.2 million charge to selling, general and administrative expenses. This charge primarily relates to an increase in bad debt reserves associated with the economic slowdown. We also recorded $99.6 million to other charges. This amount relates primarily to the completed or planned divestitures of certain core and non core operations and asset impairments pursuant to a plan adopted by us during the fourth quarter of 2001. This plan includes divesting several collection and transfer station operations resulting in a loss of approximately $52.0 million. These operations generated approximately 1% of our consolidated revenue during 2001. The sale of a portion of these operations during 2001 generated cash proceeds of approximately $2.6 million. The sale of the remaining operations is expected to generate cash proceeds of approximately $35.0 million. Our plans also include closing three of our smaller landfills. These landfills generated less than .2% of our consolidated revenue during 2001. In addition, we recorded an asset impairment for a fourth landfill. In total, we recorded a loss of approximately $31.0 million associated with the early closure of landfills or impairment charges. The remaining amount recorded to other charges during the fourth quarter is primarily for the planned disposition of excess assets. Approximately $1.0 million of the charge we recorded during the fourth quarter relates to ongoing future lease commitments and other obligations associated with planned divestitures. LANDFILL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Among our most significant investments and most valuable assets are our landfills. The additional disclosures included in this section provide the users of our financial statements with a clearer understanding of our investment in our landfills and various accounting principles that are unique to landfill operations. Available Airspace The following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001: BALANCE AS OF NEW LANDFILLS CHANGES IN BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, EXPANSIONS ACQUIRED, NET PERMITS AIRSPACE ENGINEERING DECEMBER 31, 1998 UNDERTAKEN OF DIVESTITURES GRANTED CONSUMED ESTIMATES 1999 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions)..... 1,145.5 148.0 34.6 (27.1) 3.1 1,304.1 Number of sites............... 48 7 55 Expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions)..... 84.6 184.6 135.1 (34.6) 369.7 Number of sites............... 7 11 4 (2) 20 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions)..... 1,230.1 184.6 283.1 (27.1) 3.1 1,673.8 Number of sites............... 48 7 55 36 BALANCE AS OF NEW LANDFILLS CHANGES IN BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, EXPANSIONS ACQUIRED, NET PERMITS AIRSPACE ENGINEERING DECEMBER 31, 1999 UNDERTAKEN OF DIVESTITURES GRANTED CONSUMED ESTIMATES 2000 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions)............. 1,304.1 8.8 74.6 (32.5) .1 1,355.1 Number of sites......... 55 (2) 53 Expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions)............. 369.7 31.4 (27.1) (74.6) 299.4 Number of sites......... 20 2 (1) (4) 17 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions)............. 1,673.8 31.4 (18.3) (32.5) .1 1,654.5 Number of sites......... 55 (2) 53 BALANCE AS OF NEW LANDFILLS CHANGES IN BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, EXPANSIONS ACQUIRED, NET PERMITS AIRSPACE ENGINEERING DECEMBER 31, 2000 UNDERTAKEN OF DIVESTITURES GRANTED CONSUMED ESTIMATES 2001 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions)............. 1,355.1 7.5 .7 (32.5) (1.8) 1,329.0 Number of sites......... 53 1 54 Expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions)............. 299.4 34.7 (26.5) 52.0 359.6 Number of sites......... 17 4 (1) 20 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions)............. 1,654.5 34.7 (19.0) .7 (32.5) 50.2 1,688.6 Number of sites......... 53 1 54 During 2000, we actively pursued obtaining landfill permits which resulted in adding over twice as much permitted airspace during the year than was consumed. As of December 31, 2001, we owned or operated 54 solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 1.7 billion in place cubic yards. Total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of airspace deemed by us to be likely to be permitted. These estimates are developed annually by independent engineers together with our engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys. As of December 31, 2001, total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 1.3 billion in place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus .4 billion in place cubic yards of expansion airspace which has been determined by us as likely to be permitted. Before airspace included in an expansion area is determined as likely to be permitted and, therefore, included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity, it must meet our expansion criteria. See Note 4, Landfill and Environmental Costs, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2001, 20 of our landfills meet the criteria for including expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity. At projected annual volumes, these 20 landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 33 years, including the expansion airspace. The average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 35 years. As of December 31, 2001, nine of our landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace had obtained approval from local authorities and are proceeding into the state permitting process. Also, as of December 31, 2001, five of our 20 landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace had submitted permit applications to state authorities. The remaining six landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace are in the process of obtaining approval from local authorities and have not identified any fatal flaws or impediments associated with the expansions at either the local or state level. We have never been denied an expansion permit for a landfill that included likely to be permitted airspace in its total available disposal capacity, although no assurances can be made that all future expansions will be permitted as designed. 37 Closure and Post Closure Costs The following table reflects our closure and post closure expense per cubic yard of airspace consumed for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999: 2001 2000 1999 Closure and post closure expense (in millions).............. $22.9 $23.4 $17.9 Cubic yards of airspace consumed (in millions).............. 32.5 32.5 27.1 Closure and post closure expense per cubic yard............. $ .70 $ .72 $ .66 As of December 31, 2001, accrued closure and post closure costs were $239.5 million. The current portion of these costs of $21.1 million is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in other current liabilities. The long term portion of these costs of $218.4 million is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs. As of December 31, 2001, assuming that all available landfill capacity is used, we expect to expense approximately $490.4 million of additional closure and post closure costs over the remaining lives of our facilities. Our estimates for closure and post closure do not take into account discounts for the present value of total estimated costs. If total estimated costs were discounted to present value, they would be lower. Investment in Landfills The following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 and the future expected investment as of December 31, 2001 (in millions): LANDFILLS BALANCE AS OF ACQUIRED, TRANSFERS ADDITIONS BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, CAPITAL NET OF AND CHARGED TO DECEMBER 31, 1998 ADDITIONS DIVESTITURES ADJUSTMENTS EXPENSE 1999 Non depletable landfill land........ $ 55.3 $ 1.9 $ 8.7 $(19.5) $ $ 46.4 Landfill development costs.......... 452.3 25.8 306.5 43.0 827.6 Construction in progress landfill.......................... 32.9 11.4 44.3 Accumulated depletion and amortization......................

Our total expected gross investment, excluding non depletable land, estimated to be $1.7 billion, or $.97 per cubic yard, is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based upon airspace consumed using the units of consumption method. Our estimates for expected future investment in landfills do not take into account discounts for the present value of total estimated costs. For further information, see "Closure and Post Closure Costs." We accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated. We also accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities associated with properties acquired through business combinations as a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace, as appropriate. No material amounts were charged to expense during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999. FINANCIAL CONDITION One of our key financial objectives is to maintain a simple, cost effective and transparent capital structure. At December 31, 2001, we had $16.1 million of cash and cash equivalents. We also had $142.3 million of restricted cash, of which $115.2 million relates to proceeds from tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt 39 financing that will be used to fund capital expenditures. At December 31, 2001, we had $283.2 million of tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financing outstanding at favorable interest rates. In July 1998, we entered into a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks. $500.0 million of the credit facility expires in July 2002 and the remaining $500.0 million expires in July 2003. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at LIBOR based rates. We use our operating cash flow and proceeds from our credit facilities to finance our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and other requirements. As of December 31, 2001, we had $691.4 million of availability under our credit facility. As a result of our strong financial position and liquidity, in February 2002 we reduced the short term and long term portion of our credit facility by $200.0 million and $50.0 million, respectively. In May 1999, we sold $600.0 million of unsecured notes in the public market. $225.0 million of these notes bear interest at 6 5/8% per annum and mature in 2004. The remaining $375.0 million bear interest at 7 1/8% per annum and mature in 2009. Interest on these notes is payable semi annually in May and November. The $225.0 million and $375.0 million in notes were offered at a discount of $1.0 million and $.5 million, respectively. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility. In December 1999, we entered into a $100.0 million operating lease facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles. As of December 31, 2001, $79.0 million was outstanding under this facility. In August 2001, we sold $450.0 million of unsecured notes in the public market. The notes bear interest at 6 3/4% per annum and mature in 2011. Interest on these notes is payable semi annually in February and August. The notes were offered at a discount of $2.6 million. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility. In order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates, in September 2001, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment grade rated financial institutions. The swap agreements have a total notional value of $225.0 million and require our company to pay interest at floating rates based upon changes in LIBOR and receive interest at a fixed rate of 6 5/8%. The swap agreements terminate in May 2004. At December 31, 2001, we had $283.2 million of tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings outstanding of which approximately $156.1 million was obtained during fiscal 2001. Borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on floating interest rates at the prevailing market ranging from 1.35% to 5.12% at December 31, 2001 and have maturities ranging from 2002 to 2031. As of December 31, 2001, we had $115.2 million of restricted cash related to proceeds from tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings. This restricted cash will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements. We plan to extend to July 2003 the maturity of our revolving short term credit facility prior to its expiration in July 2002. We believe that such an extension would provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due. We believe that we would be able to raise additional debt or equity financing, if necessary, to fund special corporate needs or to complete acquisitions. However, we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain additional financing under favorable terms or to extend the existing short term credit facility on the same terms. SELECTED BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTS In 1999, we were the first in our industry to provide the users of our financial statements with additional disclosures regarding selected balance sheet accounts. These additional disclosures include schedules that show the activity in our available airspace, investment in landfills, property and equipment, and other selected balance sheet accounts. We believe that these disclosures permit the readers of our financial statements to gain a better understanding of our companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. 40 The following tables reflect the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts, accrued closure and post closure, accrued self insurance and amounts due to former owners during the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 (in millions): ALLOWANCE FOR CLOSURE AND AMOUNTS DUE TO DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS POST CLOSURE SELF INSURANCE FORMER OWNERS Balance, December 31, 1998.............. $ 22.1 $ 73.4 $ 28.0 $ 26.7 Additions charged to expense............ 9.6 17.9 54.8 Additions due to acquisitions, net of divestitures.......................... 2.3 69.6 2.0 42.2 Usage...................................

This increase is due to the economic slowdown that we experienced during 2001. Our expense for self insurance as a percentage of revenue for 2000 and 2001 was 4.3% and 4.9%, respectively. This increase is primarily due to an overall increase in insurance costs that we experienced during 2001. Additions to accrued liabilities related to acquisitions are periodically reviewed during the year subsequent to the acquisition. During such reviews, accrued liabilities which are considered to be in excess of amounts required for a specific acquisition are reversed and charged against goodwill (cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired) or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace, as appropriate. As of December 31, 2001, accounts receivable were $232.9 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $19.0 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of 38 days, or 26 days net of deferred revenue. In addition, at December 31, 2001, our trade receivables in excess of 90 days old totaled $18.8 million or 7.5% of gross receivables outstanding. 41 PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT The following tables reflect the activity in our property and equipment accounts for the years ended December 31, 1999, 2000 and 2001 (in millions): GROSS PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT BALANCE AS OF ACQUISITIONS, BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, CAPITAL NET OF TRANSFERS AND DECEMBER 31, 1998 ADDITIONS RETIREMENTS DIVESTITURES ADJUSTMENTS 1999 Other land............................ $ 79.6 $ 4.6 $ $ 2.0 $ (3.4) $ 82.8 Non depletable landfill land.......... 55.3 1.9 8.7 (19.5) 46.4 Landfill development costs............ 452.3 25.8 306.5 43.0 827.6 Vehicles and equipment................ 806.4 138.9 (32.0) 48.5 (.5) 961.3 Buildings and improvements............ 152.0 8.0 (1.1) 14.9 13.7 187.5 Construction in progress landfill................ 32.9 11.4 44.3 Construction in progress other..... 23.5 46.2 (1.7) (43.6) 24.4 Total......................... $1,569.1 $258.3 $(33.1) $378.9 $ 1.1 $2,174.3 ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION AND DEPLETION BALANCE AS OF ADDITIONS BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, CHARGED TO TRANSFERS AND DECEMBER 31, 1998 EXPENSE RETIREMENTS DIVESTITURES ADJUSTMENTS 1999 Landfill development costs............ $ (90.3) $ (44.3) $ $ .5 $(1.0) $(135.1) Vehicles and equipment................

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The major components of changes in cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 are discussed below. Cash Flows From Operating Activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $459.2 million, $461.8 million and $323.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. The changes in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are due to the expansion of our business and timing of receipts and payments from accounts receivable and accounts payable, respectively. We use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayments. Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities. Cash flows used in investing activities consist primarily of cash used for business acquisitions and capital additions. Cash used to acquire businesses, net of cash acquired, was $261.2 million, $188.1 million and $777.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. Capital additions were $249.3 million, $208.0 million and $294.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999, respectively. We intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand, cash flows from operations, our revolving credit facility, tax exempt bonds and other financings. We expect to use primarily cash for future business acquisitions. Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities. Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 included commercial bank borrowings and repayments of debt in all three years, proceeds from our sale of unsecured notes in 1999 and 2001, and proceeds from issuances of tax exempt bonds in 2000 and 2001. In May 1999, we sold unsecured notes with a face value of $600.0 million at a discounted price of $598.5 million. In August 2001, we sold unsecured notes with a face value of $450.0 million at a discounted price of $447.4 million. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility. 43 In December 1999, we entered into a $100.0 million operating lease facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles. At December 31, 2001, $79.0 million was outstanding under this facility. During fiscal 2000, we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $150.0 million of our common stock. During fiscal 2001, we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $125.0 million of our common stock. As of December 31, 2001, we paid $150.1 million to repurchase approximately 9.2 million shares of our stock. We intend to finance future stock repurchases through cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our revolving credit facility and other financings. We used proceeds from our revolving credit facility, unsecured notes and tax exempt bonds to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions and to repay debt. CREDIT RATING Our company has received investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2001, our senior debt was rated Baa3 by Moodys, BBB by Standard & Poors and BBB+ by Fitch. One of our key financial objectives is to maintain our investment grade credit rating on our senior debt. We believe that frequent communication with our rating agencies and providing them with detailed information concerning our financial and operational performance is critical in achieving this objective. The following table summarizes certain financial ratios as of and for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2000 and 1999 that we believe are important to our credit rating agencies: 2001 2001 ADJUSTED(a) 2000 1999 Net debt to total capitalization.................. 41.3% 41.3% 41.7% 44.3% Net debt to EBITDA(b)............................. 2.5x 2.0x 1.9x 2.2x EBITDA to interest expense(b)..................... 6.2x 7.9x 7.7x 8.6x Operating income to total assets.................. 7.4% 10.8% 12.2% 11.9% (a) Adjusted results for 2001 exclude an $86.1 million after tax charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 related to the completed and planned divestitures and closings of certain core and non core businesses, asset impairments, downsizing our compost, mulch and soil business and related inventory adjustments, an increase in insurance reserves and an increase in bad debt expense related to the economic slowdown. (b) EBITDA represents operating income plus depreciation, amortization and depletion. While EBITDA data should not be construed as a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operations in analyzing our operating performance, financial position and cash flows, we have included EBITDA data, which is not a measure of financial performance under generally accepted accounting principles, because we believe that this data is commonly used by certain credit rating agencies to evaluate a companys financial performance. Due to the fact that not all companies calculate non GAAP measures in the same manner, the EBITDA presentation herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe that our investment grade rating from our credit rating agencies and the financial ratios above are indicative of the financial strength of our company. OPERATING LEASE FACILITY One of our key financial objectives is to maintain a simple, cost effective and transparent capital structure. As we previously disclosed in our quarterly and annual filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in December 1999, we entered into a $100.0 million facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles. The facility has a term of three years with two consecutive one year renewals and was entered into primarily because its implicit interest rate 44 was over ten basis points less than our revolving credit facility at the time. The facility meets the criteria of an operating lease under generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly we have not recorded this facility as debt nor have we recorded the related operating equipment as assets on our balance sheets. However, we have included the cost of operating equipment acquired under the facility as capital expenditures for purposes of calculating our free cash flow. As of December 31, 2001, $79.0 million was outstanding under this facility. If this facility were treated as debt as of December 31, 2001, our debt to total capitalization would increase from 41.3% to 42.8%. As a result of our success in obtaining financing in the public markets, including tax exempt bonds, we do not anticipate using this form of financing again in the foreseeable future. FUEL HEDGE Our results of operations are impacted by changes in the price of diesel fuel. Because the market for derivatives in diesel fuel is limited, we have entered into heating oil option agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to fluctuations in diesel prices. We have minimized our credit risk by entering into derivatives with a group of financial institutions having investment grade ratings. Our derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities", as amended. In order to qualify for hedge accounting, certain criteria must be met including a requirement that both at inception of the hedge, and on an ongoing basis, the hedging relationship is expected to be highly effective in offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge. Under these option agreements, we receive or make payments based on the difference between actual average heating oil prices and predetermined fixed prices. These option agreements protect us from fuel prices rising above a predetermined fixed price in the option agreements, but also limit our ability to benefit from price decreases below the predetermined fixed price in the option agreements. During June 2001, we entered into option agreements for approximately 14.3 million gallons of heating oil. These option agreements settle each month in equal notional amounts through December 2002. The option agreements were structured as zero cost collars indexed to the price of heating oil. The fair value of these option agreements at December 31, 2001 was determined by third parties to be a loss of approximately $2.8 million ($1.7 million net of tax). In accordance with SFAS 133, $1.6 million, representing the effective portion of the change in fair value during the period has been recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value was a loss of approximately $.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 and has been included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations. Realized losses of $.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2001 related to these option agreements are included in cost of operations in our Consolidated Statements of Operations. FUTURE OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our significant future obligations as of December 31, 2001: MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS OPERATING OTHER MATURITIES OF NOTES LEASE OPERATING PAYABLE AND CLOSURE AND YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, FACILITY LEASES LONG TERM DEBT POST CLOSURE TOTAL 2002.................. $12.2 $ 4.0 $ 33.6 $ 21.4 $ 71.2 2003.................. 11.0 3.1 3.8 17.4 35.3 2004.................. 46.8 2.6 229.1 19.7 298.2 2005.................. 9.9 2.3 4.2 15.9 32.3 2006.................. 1.3 3.9 16.4 21.6 Thereafter............ 6.7 1,096.0 639.1 1,741.8 Total....... $79.9 $20.0 $1,370.6 $729.9 $2,200.4 45 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a "forward looking statement." Our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates in the United States and fluctuations in LIBOR. We intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt and through interest rate swaps. All items described below are non trading. EXPECTED MATURITY DATE FAIR VALUE 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 THEREAFTER TOTAL DECEMBER 31, 2001 VARIABLE RATE DEBT: Amount outstanding (in millions)........ $31.7 $1.8 $ 2.2 $2.3 $2.0 $261.0 $301.0 $301.0 Average interest rates.................. 2.6% 2.8% 2.6% 2.5% 2.3% 1.7% 2.3% INTEREST RATE SWAPS: Amount outstanding (in millions)........ $225.0 $225.0 $ (.2) Average interest rates.................. 4.4% 4.4% The fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable and, thus, approximate current market rates. SEASONALITY Our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement weather which could delay the collection and disposal of waste, reduce the volume of waste generated or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 141, "Business Combinations" ("SFAS 141"), and Statement No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS 142"). Under SFAS 141, the use of the poolings of interests method of accounting for business combinations initiated after June 30, 2001 is prohibited. This statement also changes the criteria for the recognition of acquired intangible assets. The provisions of SFAS 141 apply to all business combinations accounted for using the purchase method of accounting completed after June 30, 2001. SFAS 142 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001. Under the provisions of SFAS 142, most of our intangible assets will no longer be subject to amortization. However, we will be required to change our methodology for evaluating impairments to intangible assets that are not subject to amortization. The adoption of SFAS 141 had no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS 142 and have not yet determined the effects of these changes on our consolidated financial position and results of operations. In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002, and will require our company to change the accounting methodology we currently use to record closure and post closure liabilities related to our landfills. The more significant of these changes includes measuring all future obligations at fair value and discounting obligations to reflect todays dollars. This statement requires a cumulative effect approach to recognizing transition amounts for existing retirement obligations. We are currently evaluating the effect of adoption of this statement, and have not determined whether the impact of adoption will be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. In August 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets." This statement supersedes Statement No. 121, "Accounting for the Impairment of Long Lived Assets and for Long Lived Assets to be Disposed Of" and APB Opinion No. 30, "Reporting the Results of Operations Reporting the Effects of Disposal of a Segment of a Business, and Extraordinary, Unusual and Infrequently Occurring Events and Transactions." This statement establishes a single accounting model for assets to be disposed of by sale and resolves certain SFAS 121 implementation 46 issues. SFAS 144 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2001, and is generally to be applied prospectively. We do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.
