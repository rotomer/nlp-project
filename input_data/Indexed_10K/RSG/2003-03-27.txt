ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and their Notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. 2002 FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES In January 2002, we publicly announced our objectives for the year. These objectives included the following: Increasing free cash flow by over 10%. Growing revenue by 1.5% to 2.0%, with 1.0% from price increases and .5% to 1.0% from volume growth. Generating earnings per share of $1.37 to $1.39. Using free cash flow to enhance shareholder value by completing strategic acquisitions and repurchasing up to $125.0 million of our stock. 2002 BUSINESS PERFORMANCE We exceeded all four of our financial objectives for 2002 despite a weak economy. The economic slowdown which began in 2001 continued to negatively impact the portion of our business servicing the manufacturing sector and non residential construction activity during 2002. Volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity continued to weaken during 2002. Despite the weakness we experienced in the aspects of our business noted above, our internal growth from core operations for 2002 was 3.0% with 1.4% from price increases and 1.6% from volume growth. During 2002, we secured several long term franchise and municipal contracts. We also benefited from the geographic mix of our business which favors high growth markets. As a result, during 2002 we were able to exceed the internal growth objectives we established at the beginning of the year. In addition to the impact of the economic slowdown discussed above, during 2002 our operating margins were also negatively impacted by increased costs for risk and health insurance, increased depreciation expense primarily associated with capital additions, and increased revenue from municipal contracts and transfer stations which have lower margins than our other lines of business. This decrease in operating margins was partially offset by an increase in recycling commodity prices, a decrease in fuel costs and the termination of our operating lease facility. During 2001, we began a number of initiatives designed to increase efficiencies and reduce costs including the implementation of a number of management information systems such as route optimization, customer relationship tracking and equipment maintenance software. We continued to realize benefits from these initiatives in 2002. Notwithstanding the impact of the economic slowdown and the increase in certain expenses, our earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $1.42, excluding a gain on sale of certain assets, which exceeded the objective we established at the beginning of the year. We were also able to exceed our free cash flow objective for the year. During 2002 our board of directors increased our previously authorized share repurchase program from $125.0 million to $150.0 million. We used our free cash flow during 2002 to repurchase 8.0 million shares of our common stock for $150.0 million. 22 2003 FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES Our financial objectives for 2003 assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter 2002. Specific guidance is as follows: Our goal is to generate free cash flow of approximately 90.0% of 2003 net income. We define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of equipment as presented in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. We anticipate using our free cash flow to repurchase shares of our common stock under our $150.0 million share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in October 2002. We anticipate earnings per share of $1.46 to $1.48, including an estimated $.03 of additional landfill costs associated with the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," and a change in accounting associated with methane gas collection systems. We anticipate internal growth from core operations to be 2.0% to 3.0%, with approximately 1.0% to 1.5% attributable to price increases and 1.0% to 1.5% attributable to volume growth. BUSINESS INITIATIVES Our business initiatives for 2003 are generally a continuation of those initiated in the prior two years and are dependent on standardizing our business processes and improving our systems. Ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and processes and are trained on our new systems is essential to the overall success of our initiatives. Our business initiatives for 2003 are as follows: Improve the quality of our revenue. The first step in this process was completed in 2001 and included installing a standardized billing and operating system. This system enables us to, among other things, stratify our customers to determine how our rates compare to current market pricing. During 2002, we implemented the second generation of this software which we call RSI 1.0. RSI 1.0, our companys core business system, provides a variety of functionalities including customer service, dispatch, billing, sales analysis, account retention and route productivity analysis. We currently monitor our return on investment by market place and are in the process of instituting a return on investment pricing model. This model will eventually allow us to track our return on investment by customer. During 2001, we also implemented a customer relationship management system. This system improves the productivity of our sales force by helping to establish marketing priorities and track sales leads. It also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial, industrial and franchise contracts. Our focus during 2003 will be to ensure our sales force is properly trained on this system and using it as intended. Improve the productivity of our operations. We have instituted a grid productivity program that enables us to benchmark the performance of our drivers. In addition, in our larger markets, we use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and improve operational density. During 2003, we will continue to update our disposal optimization reviews. These reviews determine which local disposal option maximizes our return on invested capital and cash flow. Improve fleet management and procurement. In February 2002, we selected Dossier as our fleet management and procurement system. Among other features, this system will track parts inventories, generate automatic quantity order points and log all maintenance work. It will allow us to capture and review information to ensure our preventive maintenance programs comply with manufacturers warranties. In addition, the purchase order module within this system will allow us to cross reference purchasing information with our inventory. We expect to have Dossier implemented at all of our hauling and landfill operations by the end of 2003. Enhance operational and financial reporting systems. We currently have several initiatives underway aimed at improving our operational and financial reporting systems. The overall goal of these initiatives 23 is to provide us with detailed information, prepared in a consistent manner, that will allow us to quickly analyze and act upon trends in our business. The most significant of these systems is our enterprise wide general ledger package. We successfully converted all of our locations to Lawson general ledger software in 2002 and we are currently in the process of converting all of our locations to Lawson fixed asset software. All of the system initiatives mentioned above will provide us with more consistent and detailed information, thus allowing us to make quicker and more informed business decisions. In addition, during 2001, all of our significant software applications were standardized and centralized at our data center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This standardization and centralization provides us with consolidated information concerning our operations across a variety of operational and financial disciplines. It also significantly enhances our ability to execute our disaster recovery plan, if necessary. Expand our safety training programs. As part of our ongoing emphasis on safe work practices and in light of the recent increase in insurance costs, we expanded our safety training programs in 2002. We have signed a multi year agreement with DuPont Safety Resources to assist in successfully completing this initiative. OUR BUSINESS We are a leading provider of non hazardous solid waste collection and disposal services in the United States. We provide solid waste collection services for commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers through 142 collection companies in 22 states. We also own or operate 90 transfer stations, 56 solid waste landfills and 33 recycling facilities. We generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations, and our remaining revenue is from landfill disposal services and other services, including recycling and compost, mulch and soil operations. The following table reflects our total revenue by source for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 (in millions): 2002 2001 2000 Collection: Residential.................. $ 530.7 22.4% $ 479.7 21.2% $ 434.6 20.6% Commercial................... 696.7 29.5 686.0 30.4 627.8 29.9 Industrial................... 501.6 21.2 509.6 22.6 486.5 23.1 Other........................ 50.8 2.1 47.5 2.1 47.6 2.3 Total collection..... 1,779.8 75.2 1,722.8 76.3 1,596.5 75.9 Transfer and disposal.......... 854.1 780.8 717.4 Less: Intercompany.............

Our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on long term contracts with municipalities. We generally provide industrial and commercial collection operations to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years. Our revenue from landfill operations is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties. In general, we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials. No one customer has individually accounted for more than 5% of our consolidated revenue in any of the last three years. The cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes disposal, labor, fuel and equipment maintenance costs. We try to be more efficient by controlling the movement of waste streams from the point of 24 collection through disposal. During the three months ended December 31, 2002, approximately 53% of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate. Our landfill cost of operations includes daily operating expenses, costs of capital for cell development, accruals for closure and post closure costs, and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance. We expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred. We use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs. In life cycle accounting, certain direct costs are capitalized or accrued, and charged to expense based upon the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. These costs include all costs to acquire, construct, close and maintain a site during the post closure period. Cost and airspace estimates are developed annually by independent engineers together with our engineers. These estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to annually adjust our rates used to expense capitalized costs and accrue closure and post closure costs. Changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in available airspace, inflation and applicable regulations. Changes in available airspace include changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe has a probable likelihood of being permitted. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management. In the past, we significantly expanded our accounting disclosures in a number of areas that require subjective or complex judgments including landfill accounting, fixed assets and the activity in various balance sheet accounts such as closure and post closure accruals, self insurance reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts. As part of our continuing commitment to reliable and transparent financial reporting that allows the users of our financial statements to make more informed decisions, we have prepared the following list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. The following policies related to our landfill accounting are effective through December 31, 2002. On January 1, 2003, certain of our policies will change upon the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.

We use an estimate of the undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the assets in assessing their recoverability. In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. In testing for impairment, we estimate the fair value of each operating segment of our business and compare the fair values with the carrying values. We measure impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or operating segment exceeds its fair value. BUSINESS COMBINATIONS We make decisions to acquire or invest in businesses based on financial and strategic considerations. Businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. 30 We acquired various solid waste businesses during the year ended December 31, 2002. The aggregate purchase price we paid for these transactions was $55.8 million. We acquired various solid waste businesses during the year ended December 31, 2001. The aggregate purchase price we paid for these transactions was $287.7 million. The aggregate purchase price paid, less cash and restricted cash acquired plus debt assumed, was $247.5 million. In July 1999, we entered into a definitive agreement with Allied Waste Industries to acquire certain solid waste assets. In 2000, we had completed the purchase of these assets for approximately $105.5 million in cash, $85.8 million of which were acquired during 2000. In October 1999, we entered into a definitive agreement with Allied for the simultaneous purchase and sale of certain other solid waste assets. In 2000, we and Allied had completed the purchase and sale of these assets of which annual revenue was approximately $145.0 million. Our net proceeds from the cash portion of the exchange of assets were $30.7 million. All of these transactions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting. In addition to the acquisitions from Allied, we also acquired various other solid waste businesses during the year ended December 31, 2000. The aggregate purchase price we paid in these transactions was $102.5 million in cash. Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for 2002 acquisitions totaled approximately $40.1 million. As of December 31, 2002 we had intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,569.9 million, which consist primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired. During 2002, $5.1 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace. As of December 31, 2002, we had $1,026.3 million of landfill development costs which includes purchase price allocated to landfill airspace as well as other capitalized landfill costs. When a landfill is acquired as part of a group of assets, purchase price is allocated to airspace based upon the discounted expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within the acquired group and is adjusted for other non depletable landfill assets and liabilities acquired (primarily closure and post closure liabilities). Landfill purchase price is amortized using the units of consumption method over total available airspace which includes probable expansion airspace where appropriate. Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for 2001 acquisitions totaled approximately $223.3 million. As of December 31, 2001, we had intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,551.6 million, which consists primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired. In addition, during 2001, $62.6 million of the total purchase price for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace. Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for 2000 acquisitions totaled approximately $253.4 million. As of December 31, 2000, we had intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,435.0 million, which consists primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired. In addition, during 2000, $30.9 million of the total purchase price for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Years Ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 Our net income was $239.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2002, as compared to $125.5 million in 2001 and $221.0 million in 2000. Our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 include other charges (income) described below. 31 The following table summarizes our costs and expenses in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue for 2000 through 2002: 2002 2001 2000 $ % $ % $ % Revenue.................................... $2,365.1 100.0% $2,257.5 100.0% $2,103.3 100.0% Cost of operations......................... 1,472.9 62.3 1,422.5 63.0 1,271.3 60.5 Depreciation, amortization and depletion of property and equipment................... 193.5 8.2 168.3 7.4 157.0 7.5 Amortization of intangible assets.......... 6.1 .2 47.1 2.1 40.4 1.9 Selling, general and administrative expenses................................. 238.7 10.1 236.5 10.5 193.9 9.2 Other charges (income).....................

Revenue was $2,365.1 million, $2,257.5 million and $2,103.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Revenue increased by $107.6 million, or 4.8%, from 2001 to 2002. Revenue increased by $154.2 million, or 7.3%, from 2000 to 2001.

The economic slowdown which began in 2001 continued to negatively impact the portion of our business servicing the manufacturing sector and non residential construction industry during 2002. Volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity continued to weaken during 2002. The weakness in our business attributable to the economic slowdown was partially offset by an increase in recycling commodity prices in the early part of 2002. Despite the weakness we experienced in the aspects of our business noted above, our internal growth from core operations for 2002 was 3.0%. During 2002, we secured several long term franchise and municipal contracts. We also benefited from the geographic mix of our business which favors high growth markets. During the first and second quarters of 2001, our revenue was negatively impacted by weakness in recycling commodity prices. In addition, during the second quarter of 2001, we began to see a slowdown in revenue from the manufacturing sector, particularly in the Midwestern and Mid Atlantic states. During the third quarter of 2001, the economic slowdown began to impact our industrial business servicing the non residential construction industry. Landfill volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity began to weaken. In addition, the slowdown we began to experience in the second quarter in the manufacturing sector became more acute as we experienced significant shift reductions and plant closings in the Southeastern United States, particularly in the textile and home furnishing industries in the Carolinas. These conditions were reflected in our internal growth numbers, which were approximately half of what we experienced in prior quarters. 32 During the fourth quarter of 2001, we continued to see a weakening in waste volumes from the manufacturing sector. We also continued to see a slowdown in commercial construction and special waste activity which resulted in both volume reductions and price sensitivity for these services. Furthermore, we began to see a softening in residential construction activity. We anticipate internal growth from core operations to be 2.0% to 3.0% during 2003 assuming no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of 2002. However, our price and volume growth may remain flat or may decline in 2003 depending upon the severity and duration of the economic slowdown. Cost of Operations. Cost of operations was $1,472.9 million, $1,422.5 million and $1,271.3 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 62.3%, 63.0% and 60.5%, for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in aggregate dollars from 2001 to 2002 is primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a charge of $86.1 million on an after tax basis, or $132.0 million on a pre tax basis. Of this pre tax amount, $24.2 million was recorded to cost of operations which relates primarily to the downsizing of our compost, mulch and soil business and related inventory adjustments and an increase in self insurance reserves. Excluding the impact of this charge, cost of operations for 2001 was $1,398.3 million, or 61.9% as a percent of revenue. The increase in adjusted cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from 2001 to 2002 is primarily the result of the economic slowdown, higher costs for risk and health insurance, and increased revenue from municipal contracts and transfer stations which have higher operating costs. These increases in cost of operations were partially offset by improved operating efficiencies, higher recycling commodity prices, lower fuel costs and the termination of our operating lease facility. The increase in aggregate dollars from 2000 to 2001 is primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth. The increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from 2000 to 2001, excluding the impact of the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001, is primarily a result of the economic slowdown, lower recycling commodity prices, higher labor costs and higher costs for risk and health insurance partially offset by improved operating efficiencies and revenue mix. In addition, during the third quarter of 2001 we continued to be successful in attracting municipal customers; however, these customers generally produce lower margins than other customers. To date in 2003, we have experienced a significant increase in fuel prices. We believe that cost of operations as a percentage of revenue may continue to remain high or increase further depending upon the cost of fuel, health insurance, risk insurance and other key components of our cost structure and the severity and duration of the economic slowdown. Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion of Property and Equipment. Depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were $193.5 million, $168.3 million and $157.0 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 8.2%, 7.4% and 7.5%, for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in aggregate dollars for all periods presented is primarily due to acquisitions and capital expenditures. The increase as a percentage of revenue from 2001 to 2002 is primarily due to higher depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures, acquisitions and the purchase of equipment originally placed into service pursuant to an operating lease. The decrease as a percentage of revenue from 2000 to 2001 is primarily due to lower depletion expense at our landfills resulting from higher compaction and more cost efficient cell construction. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Intangible assets consist primarily of cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired, but also includes values assigned to long term contracts and covenants not to compete. Expenses for amortization of intangible assets were $6.1 million, $47.1 million and $40.4 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, .2%, 2.1% and 1.9%, for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in aggregate dollars and as a percent of revenue from 2001 to 2002 is due to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," effective January 1, 2002 under which most of our intangible assets are no longer subject to amortization. The 33 increase in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue from 2000 to 2001 is primarily due to an increase in the aggregate dollar amount of acquisitions accounted for using the purchase method of accounting. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $238.7 million, $236.5 million and $193.9 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 10.1%, 10.5% and 9.2%, for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increases in aggregate dollars are primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a charge of $86.1 million on an after tax basis, or $132.0 million on a pre tax basis. Of this pre tax amount, $8.2 million was recorded to selling, general and administrative expenses which relates primarily to an increase in bad debt expense resulting from the economic slowdown. Excluding the impact of this charge, selling, general and administrative expenses for 2001 were $228.3 million, or 10.1% as a percent of revenue, which is consistent with 2002. The increase in selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from 2000 to 2001 is primarily due to the strengthening of our regional management structure and various systems and training initiatives. We believe that selling, general and administrative expenses in the range of 10% of revenue is appropriate for 2003 given our business platform. However, selling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue may increase depending upon the severity and duration of the economic slowdown. Other Charges. During the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a $5.6 million gain on the sale of certain assets for amounts exceeding estimates originally made during the fourth quarter of 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a charge of $86.1 million on an after tax basis, or $132.0 million on a pre tax basis. Of this pre tax amount, $99.6 million was recorded to other charges which relates primarily to completed and planned divestitures and closings of certain core and non core businesses and asset impairments. Other charges were $6.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2000. These charges relate primarily to the early closure of a landfill in south Texas. Operating Income. Operating income was $459.5 million, $283.5 million and $434.0 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 19.4%, 12.6% and 20.6%, for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Excluding the impact of the other charges (income) we recorded in the fourth quarters of 2002 and 2001, our operating income was $453.9 million, or 19.2%, and $415.5 million, or 18.4%, for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Interest Expense. We incurred interest expense on our revolving credit facility, unsecured notes and tax exempt bonds. Interest expense was $77.0 million, $80.1 million and $81.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The decrease in interest expense is due to a general market decrease in interest rates and an increase in tax exempt financings which generally bear interest at lower rates than our unsecured notes. The decrease in interest expense is also due to interest rate swap agreements that we entered into during 2001 and 2002. Capitalized interest was $2.5 million, $3.3 million and $2.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net. Interest and other income, net of other expense, was $4.0 million, $5.9 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The variances during the periods are primarily due to fluctuations in cash balances on hand and related interest income and net gains on the disposition of assets during 2000 and 2001. Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes was $146.9 million, $83.8 million and $135.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Our effective income tax rate was 38.0%, 40.0% and 38.0% for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The increase in our effective tax rate from 2000 to 2001 is the result of certain non tax deductible items included in the charge that we recorded during the fourth quarter of 2001. Excluding the impact of this charge, our effective tax rate for 2001 was 38.0%. 34 Consolidated Results of Operations. Our net income for the year ended December 31, 2002 was $239.6 million. Our adjusted net income was $236.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002. Our adjusted operating results exclude a $5.6 million pre tax, or a $3.5 million after tax, gain we recorded during the fourth quarter of 2002 on the sale of certain assets for amounts exceeding estimates originally made during the fourth quarter of 2001. LANDFILL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Among our most significant investments and most valuable assets are our landfills. The additional disclosures included in this section provide the users of our financial statements with a clearer understanding of our investment in our landfills and various accounting principles that are unique to landfill operations. Available Airspace The following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002: BALANCE AS OF NEW LANDFILLS CHANGES IN BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, EXPANSIONS ACQUIRED, NET PERMITS AIRSPACE ENGINEERING DECEMBER 31, 1999 UNDERTAKEN OF DIVESTITURES GRANTED CONSUMED ESTIMATES 2000 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions)..... 1,304.1 8.8 74.6 (32.5) .1 1,355.1 Number of sites............... 55 (2) 53 Expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions)..... 369.7 31.4 (27.1) (74.6) 299.4 Number of sites............... 20 2 (1) (4) 17 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions)..... 1,673.8 31.4 (18.3) (32.5) .1 1,654.5 Number of sites............... 55 (2) 53 BALANCE AS OF NEW LANDFILLS CHANGES IN CHANGES DECEMBER 31, EXPANSIONS ACQUIRED, NET PERMITS AIRSPACE ENGINEERING IN 2000 UNDERTAKEN OF DIVESTITURES GRANTED CONSUMED ESTIMATES DESIGN Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,355.1 7.5 .7 (32.5) (1.8) Number of sites............ 53 1 Expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions)................ 299.4 34.7 (26.5) .9 51.1 Number of sites............ 17 4 (1) Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,654.5 34.7 (19.0) .7 (32.5) (.9) 51.1 Number of sites.............. 53 1 BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,329.0 Number of sites............ 54 Expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions)................ 359.6 Number of sites............ 20 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,688.6 Number of sites.............. 54 BALANCE AS OF NEW LANDFILLS CHANGES IN CHANGES DECEMBER 31, EXPANSIONS ACQUIRED, NET PERMITS AIRSPACE ENGINEERING IN 2001 UNDERTAKEN OF DIVESTITURES GRANTED CONSUMED ESTIMATES DESIGN Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions)................ 1,329.0 4.9 45.1 (34.6) 13.1 .4 Number of sites............ 54 1 1 Expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions)................ 359.6 4.3 (35.7) (2.1) 27.2 Number of sites............ 20 2 (2) Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions)................ 1,688.6 4.3 4.9 9.4 (34.6) 11.0 27.6 Number of sites.............. 54 1 1 BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions)................ 1,357.9 Number of sites............ 56 Expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions)................ 353.3 Number of sites............ 20 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions)................ 1,711.2 Number of sites.............. 56 Changes in engineering estimates typically include minor modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information. Changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfills footprint or vertical slopes. 35 During 2000, we actively pursued obtaining landfill permits which resulted in adding over twice as much permitted airspace during the year than was consumed. During 2001, total available airspace increased by 34.1 million cubic yards primarily due to changes in design partially offset by consumption. During 2002, total available airspace increased by 22.6 million cubic yards primarily due to the opening of a greenfield site in South Carolina, and changes in engineering estimates partially offset by consumption. As of December 31, 2002, we owned or operated 56 solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 1.7 billion in place cubic yards. Total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace. These estimates are developed annually by independent engineers together with our engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys. As of December 31, 2002, total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 1.4 billion in place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus .3 billion in place cubic yards of probable expansion airspace. Before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and, therefore, included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity, it must meet our expansion criteria. See Note 4, Accrued Landfill, Environmental and Legal Costs of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2002, twenty of our landfills meet the criteria for including probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity. At projected annual volumes, these twenty landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 32 years, including probable expansion airspace. The average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 34 years. As of December 31, 2002, five of our landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace had obtained approval from local authorities and are proceeding into the state permitting process. Also, as of December 31, 2002, nine of our twenty landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace had submitted permit applications to state authorities. The remaining six landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace are in the process of obtaining approval from local authorities and have not identified any fatal flaws or impediments associated with the expansions at either the local or state level. Closure and Post Closure Costs The following table reflects our closure and post closure expense per cubic yard of airspace consumed for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000: 2002 2001 2000 Closure and post closure expense (in millions).............. $26.1 $22.9 $23.4 Cubic yards of airspace consumed (in millions).............. 34.6 32.5 32.5 Closure and post closure expense per cubic yard............. $ .75 $ .70 $ .72 As of December 31, 2002, accrued closure and post closure costs were $255.8 million. The current portion of these costs of $22.1 million is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in other current liabilities. The long term portion of these costs of $233.7 million is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in accrued landfill, environmental and legal costs. As of December 31, 2002, assuming that all available landfill capacity is used, we expect to expense approximately $541.3 million of additional closure and post closure costs over the remaining lives of our facilities. Our estimates for closure and post closure do not take into account discounts for the present value of total estimated costs. If total estimated costs were discounted to present value, they would be lower. 36 Investment in Landfills The following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 and the future expected investment as of December 31, 2002 (in millions): LANDFILLS BALANCE AS OF ACQUIRED, TRANSFERS IMPAIRED ADDITIONS BALANCE AS OF DECEMBER 31, CAPITAL NET OF AND ASSET CHARGED TO DECEMBER 31, 1999 ADDITIONS DIVESTITURES ADJUSTMENTS WRITE DOWN EXPENSE 2000 Non depletable landfill land...................... $ 46.4 $ .5 $ 1.1 $ (.8) $ $ $ 47.2 Landfill development costs..................... 827.6 7.6 (16.0) 58.0 (11.7) 865.5 Construction in progress landfill...... 44.3 62.1 (.1) (59.7) 46.6 Accumulated depletion and amortization..............

As of December 31, 2002, we expect to spend an estimated additional $1,146.4 million on existing landfills, primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures, over their expected remaining lives. Our total expected gross investment, excluding non depletable land, estimated to be $1.9 billion, or $1.11 per cubic yard, is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based upon airspace consumed using the units of consumption method. Our estimates for expected future investment in landfills do not take into account inflation or discounts for the present value of total estimated costs. For further information, see "Closure and Post Closure Costs." We accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated. We also accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities associated with properties acquired through business combinations as a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace, as appropriate. No material amounts were charged to expense during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000. FINANCIAL CONDITION One of our key financial objectives is to maintain a simple, cost effective and transparent capital structure. At December 31, 2002, we had $141.5 million of cash and cash equivalents. We also had $175.0 million of restricted cash, of which $139.7 million relates to proceeds from tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financing that will be used to fund capital expenditures. At December 31, 2002, we had $378.2 million of tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financing outstanding at favorable interest rates. In July 1998, we entered into a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks. $500.0 million of the credit facility was scheduled to expire in July 2002 and the remaining $500.0 million was scheduled to expire in July 2003. As a result of our strong financial position and liquidity, in February 2002 we reduced the short and long term portions of our credit facility to $300.0 million and $450.0 million, respectively. In July 2002, we renewed the short and long term portions of our credit facility on substantially the same terms and conditions. The short term portion of the facility expires in July 2003 and the long term portion expires in July 2007. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at LIBOR based rates. We use our operating cash flow and proceeds from our credit facilities to finance our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and other requirements. As of December 31, 2002, we had $437.7 million available under our credit facility. In May 1999, we sold $600.0 million of unsecured notes in the public market. $225.0 million of these notes bear interest at 6 5/8% per annum and mature in 2004. The remaining $375.0 million bear interest at 7 1/8% per annum and mature in 2009. Interest on these notes is payable semi annually in May and November. The $225.0 million and $375.0 million in notes were offered at a discount of $1.0 million and $.5 million, respectively. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility. In December 1999, we entered into an operating lease facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles. In July 2002, we exercised our right to purchase the equipment underlying this facility by paying $72.6 million using our excess cash, which was the balance outstanding under the facility at that time. In August 2001, we sold $450.0 million of unsecured notes in the public market. The notes bear interest at 6 3/4% and mature in 2011. Interest on these notes is payable semi annually in February and August. The notes were offered at a discount of $2.6 million. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility. In order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates, in September 2001 and October 2002, we entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment grade rated financial institutions. The swap agreements have total notional values of $225.0 million and $75.0 million, respectively, and require our 38 company to pay interest at floating rates based upon changes in LIBOR and receive interest at fixed rates of 6 5/8% and 6 3/4%, respectively. The swap agreements terminate in May 2004 and August 2011, respectively. At December 31, 2002, we had $378.2 million of tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings outstanding of which approximately $96.5 million was obtained during fiscal 2002. Borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on fixed or floating interest rates at the prevailing market ranging from 1.45% to 5.25% at December 31, 2002 and have maturities ranging from 2003 to 2032. As of December 31, 2002, we had $139.7 million of restricted cash related to proceeds from tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings. This restricted cash will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements. We plan to extend the maturity of our revolving short term credit facility prior to its expiration in July 2003 to July 2004. We believe that such an extension would provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due. We believe that we would be able to raise additional debt or equity financing, if necessary, to fund special corporate needs or to complete acquisitions. However, we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain additional financing under favorable terms or to extend the existing short term credit facility on the same terms. SELECTED BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTS We were the first in our industry to provide the users of our financial statements with additional disclosures regarding selected balance sheet accounts. These additional disclosures include schedules that show the activity in our available airspace, investment in landfills, property and equipment, and other selected balance sheet accounts. We believe that these disclosures permit the readers of our financial statements to gain a better understanding of our companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. The following tables reflect the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts, accrued closure and post closure, accrued self insurance and amounts due to former owners during the years ended December 31, 2000, 2001 and 2002 (in millions): CLOSURE, POST CLOSURE ALLOWANCE FOR AND AMOUNTS DUE TO DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS REMEDIATION SELF INSURANCE FORMER OWNERS Balance, December 31, 1999............ $ 14.2 $152.3 $ 38.4 $ 47.0 Additions charged to expense.......... 11.8 23.4 100.1 Additions due to acquisitions, net of divestitures........................ 2.1 9.1 7.0 Payments or usage.....................

As of December 31, 2002, accounts receivable were $238.6 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $19.0 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of 36 days, or 23 days net of deferred revenue. In addition, at December 31, 2002, our trade receivables in excess of 90 days old totaled $13.8 million, or 5.4% of gross receivables outstanding. Our expense for self insurance as a percentage of revenue for 2000, 2001 and 2002 was 4.8%, 5.8% and 5.8%, respectively. The increases are primarily due to overall increases in insurance costs that we experienced during 2001 and 2002.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The major components of changes in cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 are discussed below. Cash Flows From Operating Activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $569.7 million, $459.2 million and $461.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. The changes in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are due to the expansion of our business, deferred taxes and timing of receipts and payments from accounts receivable and accounts payable, respectively. We use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayments. 41 Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities. Cash flows used in investing activities consist primarily of cash used for capital additions and business acquisitions. Cash used to acquire businesses, net of cash acquired, was $55.8 million, $261.2 million and $188.1 million during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. Capital additions were $258.6 million, $249.3 million and $208.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000, respectively. We intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand, cash flows from operations, our revolving credit facility, tax exempt bonds and other financings. We expect to use primarily cash for future business acquisitions. Cash Flows From (Used In) Financing Activities. Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 included commercial bank borrowings and repayments of debt in all three years, proceeds from our sale of unsecured notes in 2001, and proceeds from issuances of tax exempt bonds in 2002, 2001 and 2000. In August 2001, we sold unsecured notes with a face value of $450.0 million at a discounted price of $447.4 million. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility. In December 1999, we entered into an operating lease facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles. In July 2002, we retired this facility using our excess cash. During 2000, 2001 and 2002, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $150.0 million, $125.0 million and $175.0 million, respectively, of our common stock. As of December 31, 2002, we paid $300.1 million to repurchase approximately 17.2 million shares of our stock, of which we paid $150.0 million during 2002 to repurchase approximately 8.0 million shares of our stock. We intend to finance future stock repurchases through cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our revolving credit facility and other financings. We used proceeds from our revolving credit facility, unsecured notes and tax exempt bonds to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions and to repay debt. CREDIT RATING Our company has received investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2002, our senior debt was rated Baa3 by Moodys, BBB by Standard & Poors and BBB+ by Fitch. One of our key financial objectives is to maintain our investment grade credit rating on our senior debt. We believe that frequently communicating with our rating agencies and providing them with detailed information concerning our financial and operational performance is critical in achieving this objective. The following table demonstrates our improvement in certain financial ratios as of and for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2001 and 2000 that we believe are important to our credit rating agencies: 2002 2001 2001 ADJUSTED(A) 2000 Net debt to total capitalization..................... 38.2% 41.3% 41.3% 41.7% Net debt to EBITDA(b)................................ 1.8x 2.5x 2.0x 1.9x EBITDA to interest expense(b)........................ 8.6x 6.2x 7.9x 7.7x Operating income to total assets..................... 10.9% 7.4% 10.8% 12.2% (a) Adjusted results for 2001 exclude an $86.1 million after tax charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of 2001 related to the completed and planned divestitures and closings of certain core and non core businesses, asset impairments, downsizing our compost, mulch and soil business and related inventory adjustments, an increase in self insurance reserves and an increase in bad debt expense related to the economic slowdown. (b) EBITDA represents operating income plus depreciation, amortization and depletion. While EBITDA data should not be construed as a substitute for operating income, net income or cash flows from operations in analyzing our operating performance, financial position and cash flows, we have included EBITDA data, which is not a measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with accounting 42 principles generally accepted in the United States, because we believe that this data is commonly used by certain credit rating agencies to evaluate a companys financial performance. Due to the fact that not all companies calculate non GAAP measures in the same manner, the EBITDA presentation herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We believe that our investment grade rating from our credit rating agencies and the financial ratios above are indicative of the financial strength of our company. OPERATING LEASE FACILITY One of our key financial objectives is to maintain a simple, cost effective and transparent capital structure. As we previously disclosed in our quarterly and annual filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, in December 1999, we entered into a $100.0 million facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles. The facility had a term of three years with two consecutive one year renewals and was entered into primarily because its implicit interest rate was over ten basis points less than our revolving credit facility at the time. The facility met the criteria of an operating lease under generally accepted accounting principles. Accordingly, during the term of this facility, we did not record this facility as debt nor did we record the related operating equipment as assets on our balance sheets. However, we included the cost of operating equipment acquired under the facility as capital expenditures for purposes of calculating our free cash flow. In July 2002, we exercised our right to purchase the equipment underlying this facility by paying $72.6 million using our excess cash, which was the balance outstanding under the facility at that time. As a result of our success in obtaining financing in the public markets, including tax exempt bonds, we do not anticipate using this form of financing again in the foreseeable future. FUEL HEDGE We have minimized our risk associated with changes in the price of diesel fuel by entering into derivatives with a group of financial institutions having investment grade ratings. Our derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended. Under these option agreements, we receive or make payments based on the difference between actual average heating oil prices and predetermined fixed prices. These option agreements protect us from fuel prices rising above a predetermined fixed price in the option agreements, but also limit our ability to benefit from price decreases below the predetermined fixed price in the option agreements. During June 2001, we entered into option agreements for approximately 14.3 million gallons of heating oil. These option agreements settled each month in equal notional amounts through December 2002. The option agreements were structured as zero cost collars indexed to the price of heating oil. The option agreements expired in December 2002. In accordance with SFAS 133, $1.6 million and $(1.6) million, net of tax, representing the effective portion of the change in fair value during the periods have been recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The ineffective portions of the changes in fair value of approximately $.1 million and $(.1) million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, have been included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Realized losses of $.8 million and $.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to these option agreements are included in cost of operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income. 43 FUTURE OBLIGATIONS The following table summarizes our significant future obligations as of December 31, 2002: MATURITIES OF NOTES OPERATING PAYABLE AND CLOSURE AND YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, LEASES LONG TERM DEBT POST CLOSURE REMEDIATION TOTAL 2003......................... $ 4.0 $ 2.8 $ 17.8 $ 4.3 $ 28.9 2004......................... 3.4 227.7 30.9 .9 262.9 2005......................... 2.9 2.7 17.4 2.9 25.9 2006......................... 2.7 2.4 19.6 .9 25.6 2007......................... 2.6 1.9 14.3 .9 19.7 Thereafter................... 9.2 1,197.7 638.2 49.0 1,894.1 Total.............. $24.8 $1,435.2 $738.2 $58.9 $2,257.1 QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a "forward looking statement." Our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates in the United States and fluctuations in LIBOR. We intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. All items described below are non trading. EXPECTED MATURITY DATE FAIR VALUE (ASSET)/LIABILITY DECEMBER 31, 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 THEREAFTER TOTAL 2002 VARIABLE RATE DEBT: Amount outstanding (in millions)... $ .6 $ .6 $ .6 $ .3 $ $257.6 $259.7 $259.7 Average interest rates............. 1.80% 1.80% 1.80% 1.80% % 1.68% 1.68% INTEREST RATE SWAPS: Amount outstanding (in millions)... $225.0 $ 75.0 $300.0 $ (9.1) Average interest rates............. 2.6% 2.1% 2.5% The fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable and, thus, approximate current market rates. SEASONALITY Our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement weather which could delay the collection and disposal of waste, reduce the volume of waste generated or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2001, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations." This statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after June 15, 2002 and applies to all legally enforceable obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets. SFAS 143 will require our company to change the methodology we currently use to record closure and post closure costs related to our landfills. The most significant change to our methodology promulgated by this statement is inflating and discounting obligations to reflect todays dollars. SFAS 143 does not change the basic landfill accounting policies followed by us and others in the waste industry. In general, the industry has amortized capitalized costs and accrued future closure and post closure obligations using the units of consumption method as cubic yards of available airspace are consumed over the life of the related landfill. This practice is referred to as life cycle accounting and will continue to be followed except as modified by SFAS 143 as discussed below. 44 Under SFAS 143, obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill will be recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event. Obligations related to closure and post closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations will be recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire landfill. Landfill retirement obligations will be capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units of consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed throughout the entire landfill, depending upon the nature of the obligation. All obligations will be initially measured at estimated fair value. Fair value will be calculated on a present value basis using the companys credit adjusted, risk free rate. Upon adopting SFAS 143, the company will no longer record closure and post closure expense as a component of cost of operations. Instead, amortization expense will be recorded on the capitalized portion of the obligation and accretion expense will be recorded using the effective interest method. The table below reflects significant changes between our current methodology and the methodology we will use upon adopting SFAS 143: PRACTICE UPON ADOPTION OF DESCRIPTION CURRENT PRACTICE SFAS NO. 143 DEFINITIONS: Final Capping Costs related to installation of No change. the components that comprise the permanent final cover over areas of a landfill where airspace capacity has been consumed.

Expense recognized as a component of operating expenses at credit adjusted, risk free rate (6.75%) using the effective interest method. We will adopt SFAS No. 143 beginning January 1, 2003 and, based on current estimates, will record an after tax expense of approximately $21 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. In addition, beginning January 1, 2003, we will modify our accounting for methane gas collection systems and, based on current estimates, will record an after tax expense of approximately $17 million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle. We expect that the impact of adopting SFAS No. 143 and changing 46 our accounting for methane gas collection systems in 2003 will decrease earnings per share in the range of $.02 to $.03 per share. The adoption of SFAS No. 143 will have no net effect on our cash flow. In July 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement No. 146, "Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities." SFAS No. 146 addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities, such as restructurings, involuntarily terminating employees and consolidating facilities initiated after December 31, 2002. The implementation of SFAS No. 146 is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 47
