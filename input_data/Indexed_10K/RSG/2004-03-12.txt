ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and their Notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Overview of Our Business We are a leading provider of non hazardous solid waste collection and disposal services in the United States. We provide solid waste collection services for commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers through 142 collection companies in 22 states. We also own or operate 93 transfer stations, 58 solid waste landfills and 35 recycling facilities. We generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations, and our remaining revenue is from landfill disposal services and other services, including recycling and compost, mulch and soil operations. The following table reflects our total revenue by source for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 (in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Collection: Residential $ 601.2 23.9 % $ 530.7 22.4 % $ 479.7 21.2 % Commercial 706.0 28.0 696.7 29.5 686.0 30.4 Industrial 523.0 20.8 501.6 21.2 509.6 22.6 Other 50.9 2.0 50.8 2.1 47.5 2.1 Total collection 1,881.1 74.7 1,779.8 75.2 1,722.8 76.3 Transfer and disposal 967.5 854.1 780.8 Less: Intercompany (493.7 ) (428.5 ) (405.0 ) Transfer and disposal, net 473.8 18.8 425.6 18.0 375.8 16.7 Other 162.9 6.5 159.7 6.8 158.9 7.0 Total revenue $ 2,517.8 100.0 % $ 2,365.1 100.0 % $ 2,257.5 100.0 % Our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers. Our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on long term contracts with municipalities. We generally provide industrial and commercial collection operations to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years. Our revenue from landfill operations is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties. In general, we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials. No one customer has individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years. The cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes disposal, labor, self insurance, fuel and equipment maintenance costs. We try to be more efficient by controlling the movement of waste streams from the point of collection through disposal. During the three months ended December 31, 2003, approximately 54% of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate. Our landfill costs include daily operating expenses, costs of capital for cell development, costs for final capping, closure and post closure, and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance. We expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred. We use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs. In life cycle accounting, certain direct costs are capitalized, and charged to expense based upon the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. These costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site. Obligations associated with final capping, closure and post closure are capitalized, and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed. 22 Table of Contents Cost and airspace estimates are developed annually by engineers. These estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to annually adjust our rates used to expense capitalized costs. Changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in available airspace, inflation and applicable regulations. Changes in available airspace include changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe has a probable likelihood of being permitted. Our operations are managed and reviewed through five regions which we designate as our reportable segments. From 2002 to 2003, operating income increased in our Central, Southwestern and Western regions due to an overall increase in revenue resulting from the successful execution of our growth strategy. In the Eastern and Southern regions, increased revenue was offset by negative local economic conditions and an increase in costs associated with the long haul transport of waste by third party vendors. 2003 Financial Objectives In January 2003, we publicly announced our objectives for the year. These objectives included the following: Generating free cash flow equal to 90% of net income. Growing revenue by 2.0% to 3.0%, with 1.0% to 1.5% from price increases and 1.0% to 1.5% from volume growth. Generating earnings per share before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles of $1.46 to $1.48. Using free cash flow to enhance shareholder value by completing strategic acquisitions and repurchasing up to $150.0 million of our stock. 2003 Business Performance Despite a weak economy and a significant increase in insurance expense, we were able to exceed our free cash flow, internal growth and share repurchase objectives during 2003. The economic slowdown which began in 2001 continued to negatively impact the portion of our business servicing the manufacturing sector and non residential construction activity during 2003. Despite the weakness we experienced in the aspects of our business noted above, our internal growth from core operations for 2003 was 3.9% with 1.8% from price increases and 2.1% from volume growth. During 2003, we continued to benefit from several long term franchise and municipal contracts that were secured during 2002. In addition, our geographic mix of business, which is concentrated in high growth markets, positively impacted our operating results. As a result, during 2003 we were able to exceed the internal growth objectives we established at the beginning of the year. During 2003 our operating margins were negatively impacted by increased costs for self insurance expense. This increase in self insurance expense relates to existing claims and is attributable to the expansion of our operations and various changes in estimates as a result of continued negative trends through our current policy year, based on recent actuarial claims experience, expected claims development and medical cost inflation. In addition to the economic slowdown and increased costs for self insurance, during 2003 our operating margins were also negatively impacted by increased fuel costs, increased depreciation expense primarily associated with capital additions, increased state landfill taxes and increased revenue from municipal contracts and transfer stations which have lower margins than our other lines of business. This decrease in operating margins was partially offset by a decrease in costs associated with the termination of our operating lease facility and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expense as a percent of revenue. During 2001, we began a number of initiatives designed to increase efficiencies and reduce costs including the implementation of a number of management information systems such as route optimization, customer relationship tracking and equipment maintenance software. We continued to realize benefits from these initiatives in 2003. 23 Table of Contents Notwithstanding the impact of the economic slowdown and the increase in self insurance and other expenses, our earnings per share before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles for the year ended December 31, 2003 was $1.33. However we were able to generate free cash flow of $336.4 million (consisting of cash provided by operating activities of $600.5 million, less purchases of property and equipment of $273.2 million, plus proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $9.1 million) which substantially exceeded our objective. During October 2003, our board of directors increased our previously authorized share repurchase program from $150.0 million to $175.0 million and also authorized an additional $200.0 million share repurchase program. We used our free cash flow during 2003 to repurchase 8.4 million shares of our common stock for $184.2 million. Also during July 2003, our board of directors initiated a quarterly dividend of $.06 per share. 2004 Financial Objectives Our financial objectives for 2004 assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter 2003. Specific guidance is as follows: We expect to generate free cash flow of approximately $340 million. We anticipate using our free cash flow to repurchase shares of our common stock under our $200.0 million share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in October 2003 and to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends. We anticipate earnings per share of $1.50 to $1.55 per share. We expect internal growth from core operations to be 3%, with approximately 2% attributable to price increases and 1% attributable to volume growth. Business Initiatives Our business initiatives for 2004 are generally a continuation of those initiated in the prior two years and are dependent on standardizing our business processes and improving our systems. Ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and processes and are trained on our new systems is essential to the overall success of our initiatives. Our business initiatives for 2004 are as follows: Pricing initiatives. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we implemented a broad based pricing initiative across all lines of our business. The purpose of this initiative is to recover increasing costs. We began to realize the benefit of this initiative during the fourth quarter of 2003 and our anticipated internal revenue growth in 2004 includes the benefit we expect to realize from this initiative during the next year. Improve the quality of our revenue. The first step in this process was completed in 2001 and included installing a standardized billing and operating system. This system enables us to, among other things, stratify our customers to determine how our rates compare to current market pricing. During 2002, we implemented the second generation of this software which we call RSI 1.0. RSI 1.0, our companys core business system, provides a variety of functionalities including customer service, dispatch, billing, sales analysis, account retention and route productivity analysis. We currently monitor our return on investment by market place and are in the process of instituting a return on investment pricing model. This model will eventually allow us to track our return on investment by customer. During 2001, we also implemented a customer relationship management system. This system improves the productivity of our sales force by helping to establish marketing priorities and track sales leads. It also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial, industrial and franchise contracts. Our focus during 2004 will be to continue to ensure our sales force is properly trained on this system and using it as intended. 24 Table of Contents Improve the productivity of our operations. We use a grid productivity program that enables us to benchmark the performance of our drivers. In addition, in our larger markets, we use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and improve operational density. During 2004, we will continue to update our disposal optimization reviews. These reviews determine which local disposal option maximizes our return on invested capital and cash flow. Improve fleet management and procurement. In February 2002, we selected Dossier as our fleet management and parts procurement system. During 2003, we implemented Dossier at all of our significant hauling and landfill operations. Among other features, this system tracks parts inventories, generates automatic quantity order points and logs all maintenance work. It allows us to capture and review information to ensure our preventive maintenance programs comply with manufacturers warranties and governmental regulations. In addition, the purchase order module within this system allows us to cross reference purchasing information with our inventory. Enhance operational and financial reporting systems. We have several initiatives aimed at improving our operational and financial reporting systems. The overall goal of these initiatives is to provide us with detailed information, prepared in a consistent manner, that will allow us to quickly analyze and act upon trends in our business. The most significant of these systems is our enterprise wide general ledger package. We successfully converted all of our locations to Lawson general ledger software in 2002 and in 2003 successfully converted all of our locations to Lawson fixed asset software. All of the system initiatives mentioned above will provide us with more consistent and detailed information, thus allowing us to make quicker and more informed business decisions. In addition, during 2001, all of our significant software applications were standardized and centralized at our data center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This standardization and centralization provides us with consolidated information concerning our operations across a variety of operational and financial disciplines. It also significantly enhances our ability to execute our disaster recovery plan, if necessary. Expand our safety training programs. As part of our ongoing emphasis on safe work practices and in light of increasing insurance costs, we expanded our safety training programs in 2002. We have signed a multi year agreement with DuPont Safety Resources to assist in successfully completing this initiative. Critical Accounting Policies and Disclosures Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management. The following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our 25 Table of Contents companys financial condition, results of operations and cash flows, and may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Landfill Accounting: Life Cycle Accounting We use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain landfill costs over the life of the site. In life cycle accounting, all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized, and charged to expense based upon the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. Obligations associated with final capping, closure and post closure are capitalized, and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed. Cost and airspace estimates are developed annually by engineers. Changes in these estimates could significantly affect our amortization, depletion, and accretion expense. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Landfill and Environmental Matters. Note 3, Accrued Landfill, Environmental and Legal Costs in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Probable Expansion Airspace We include in our calculation of total available airspace expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood that the expansion area will ultimately be permitted. We have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace. We believe that satisfying each of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted. However, because some of these criteria are judgmental, they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted. In either of these scenarios, our amortization, depletion, final capping, closure and post closure expense could change significantly. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Landfill and Environmental Matters. Note 3, Accrued Landfill, Environmental and Legal Costs in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 26 Table of Contents Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Final Capping, Closure and Post Closure Prior to January 1, 2003, costs for final closure of our landfills and costs for providing required post closure monitoring and maintenance were charged to cost of operations based upon consumed airspace using the units of consumption method. These costs were not inflated or discounted to the present value of total estimated costs. On January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Under SFAS 143, obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event. Obligations related to closure and post closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire landfill life. Landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units of consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed throughout the entire landfill, depending upon the nature of the obligation. All obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value. Fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and the companys credit adjusted, risk free rate. Total future costs for capping, closure and post closure are developed annually by engineers. Changes in these estimates could affect our expenses relating to final capping, closure and post closure.

Note 3, Accrued Landfill, Environmental and Legal Costs in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 Table of Contents Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Self Insurance: Our insurance programs for workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured. Self insurance accruals are based on claims reported and actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not reported. Estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported are developed actuarially. If actual claims experience or development is significantly different than our estimates, our self insurance expense would change. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Selected Balance Sheet Accounts. Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Property and Equipment: Expenditures for Improvements, Repairs and Maintenance Expenditures for major additions and improvements to facilities are capitalized. All expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred. Whether certain expenditures improve an asset or lengthen its useful life is subject to our judgment. Accordingly, the actual useful lives of our assets could differ from our estimates. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Property and Equipment. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Useful Lives Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization expense is provided over the estimated useful lives of the applicable assets using the straight line method. The estimated useful lives are seven to forty years for buildings and improvements, five to twelve years for vehicles, seven to ten years for most landfill equipment, three to fifteen years for all other equipment, and five to twelve years for furniture and fixtures. Our estimates regarding the useful lives of our depreciable assets are based on our judgment. Accordingly, actual useful lives could differ from our estimates. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Property and Equipment. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 28 Table of Contents Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Capitalized Interest We capitalize interest on landfill cell construction and other construction projects in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost. Capitalizing too little or too much interest expense could lead to a misstatement of interest expense in the statement of income. In order to minimize this risk, construction projects must meet the following criteria before interest is capitalized: 1. Total construction costs are $50,000 or greater, 2. the construction phase is one month or longer, and 3. the assets have a useful life of one year or longer. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Property and Equipment. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue and Accounts Receivable: Revenue consists primarily of collection fees from various customer types and transfer and landfill disposal fees charged to third parties. Advance billings are recorded as deferred revenue. Revenue is recognized over the period in which services are provided. No one customer has individually accounted for more than 10.0% of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the past three years. Reserves for accounts receivable are provided when a receivable is believed to be uncollectible or generally when a receivable is in excess of 90 days old. Establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our accounts receivable reserve is a matter of judgment. If our judgment and estimates concerning the adequacy of our reserve for accounts receivable is incorrect, bad debt expense would change.

Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 29 Table of Contents Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Derivatives: From time to time, we use derivatives to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and diesel fuel prices. These derivatives have been accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The hedging relationships we have entered into are expected to be either 100% effective or highly effective and have been determined to meet the criteria for hedge accounting. If, in the future, these relationships are no longer expected to be 100% or highly effective, or if they no longer meet the criteria for hedge accounting, our results of operations could change.

Note 5, Debt and Note 11, Fuel Hedge in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 30 Table of Contents Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Long Lived Asset Impairments: Long lived assets consist primarily of property, equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets. We periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred (as further described in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements) that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life of long lived assets or whether the remaining balance of these assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. We use an estimate of the undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the assets in assessing their recoverability. In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. In testing for impairment, we estimate the fair value of each operating segment of our business and compare the fair values with the carrying values. If the fair value of an operating segment is greater than its carrying value, then no impairment results. We measure impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or operating segment exceeds its fair value. Our estimates of future cash flows and fair values are based on our judgment. Accordingly, we could designate certain assets as impaired that are not and fail to identify certain impaired assets.

Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies and Note 4, Business Combinations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 31 Table of Contents Business Combinations We make decisions to acquire or invest in businesses based on financial and strategic considerations. Businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. We acquired various solid waste businesses during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. The aggregate purchase prices we paid for these transactions was $51.5 million, $55.8 million and $287.7 million, respectively. The aggregate purchase price paid for businesses acquired during 2001, less cash and restricted cash acquired plus debt assumed, was $247.5 million. Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for 2003 acquisitions totaled approximately $21.2 million. As of December 31, 2003 we had intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,583.1 million, which consist primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired. During 2003, $27.7 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace. As of December 31, 2003, we had $690.6 million of landfill development costs net of accumulated depletion and amortization which includes purchase price allocated to landfill airspace as well as other capitalized landfill costs. When a landfill is acquired as part of a group of assets, purchase price is allocated to airspace based upon the discounted expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within the acquired group and is adjusted for other non depletable landfill assets and liabilities acquired (primarily final capping, closure and post closure liabilities). Landfill purchase price is amortized using the units of consumption method over total available airspace which includes probable expansion airspace where appropriate. Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for 2002 acquisitions totaled approximately $40.1 million. As of December 31, 2002 we had intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,569.9 million, which consist primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired. Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for 2001 acquisitions totaled approximately $223.3 million. As of December 31, 2001, we had intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,551.6 million, which consist primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired. In addition, during 2001, $62.6 million of the total purchase price for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace. Consolidated Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 Our income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles was $215.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2003, as compared to $239.6 million in 2002 and $125.5 million in 2001. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes an after tax expense of $37.8 million (net of an income tax benefit of $23.1 million), or $.23 per share, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, and a change in accounting principle for our methane gas collection systems. See Note 1, Basis of Presentation, of the Notes to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these changes in accounting principles. Our operating results for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001 include other charges (income) described below. 32 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our costs and expenses in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue for 2001 through 2003: 2003 2002 2001 $ % $ % $ % Revenue $ 2,517.8 100.0 % $ 2,365.1 100.0 % $ 2,257.5 100.0 % Cost of operations 1,605.4 63.8 1,472.9 62.3 1,422.5 63.0 Depreciation, amortization and depletion of property and equipment 233.8 9.3 193.5 8.2 168.3 7.4 Amortization of intangible assets 5.3 .2 6.1 .2 47.1 2.1 Accretion 12.7 .5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 247.9 9.8 238.7 10.1 236.5 10.5 Other charges (income) (5.6 ) (.2 ) 99.6 4.4 Operating income $ 412.7 16.4 % $ 459.5 19.4 % $ 283.5 12.6 % Revenue. Revenue was $2,517.8 million, $2,365.1 million and $2,257.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Revenue increased by $152.7 million, or 6.5%, from 2002 to 2003. Revenue increased by $107.6 million, or 4.8%, from 2001 to 2002. The following table reflects the components of our revenue growth for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001: 2003 2002 2001 Core price 1.8 % 1.4 % 1.9 % Fuel surcharges .2 Recycling commodities .1 .4 (1.1) Total price 2.1 1.8 .8 Core volume 2.1 1.6 1.5 Non core volume .4 .8 Total volume 2.1 2.0 2.3 Total internal growth 4.2 3.8 3.1 Acquisitions 1.8 .8 4.2 Taxes(a) .5 .2 Total revenue growth 6.5 % 4.8 % 7.3 % (a) Represents new taxes levied on landfill volumes in certain states that are passed on to customers. 2003: We experienced moderate growth in revenue due to core pricing during the first three quarters of 2003. During the fourth quarter of 2003 our revenue growth from core pricing increased due to our broad based pricing initiative. We anticipate that we will continue to realize the benefit from this pricing initiative during 2004. During 2003, the economic slowdown which began during 2001 continued to negatively impact our business. However, during 2003, our revenue growth from core volume continued to be positively impacted by long term franchise and municipal contracts that were secured during 2002. As we entered into fewer new franchise and municipal contracts during 2003 versus 2002, we anticipate that we will experience less revenue growth from core volume in 2004. 2002: The economic slowdown which began in 2001 continued to negatively impact the portion of our business servicing the manufacturing sector and non residential construction industry during 2002. Volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity continued to weaken during 2002. The weakness in our business attributable to the economic slowdown was partially offset by an increase in recycling commodity prices in the early part of 2002. 33 Table of Contents Despite the weakness we experienced in the aspects of our business noted above, our internal growth from core operations for 2002 was 3.0%. During 2002, we secured several long term franchise and municipal contracts. We also benefited from the geographic mix of our business which favors high growth markets. 2001: During the first and second quarters of 2001, our revenue was negatively impacted by weakness in recycling commodity prices. In addition, during the second quarter of 2001, we began to see a slowdown in revenue from the manufacturing sector, particularly in the Midwestern and Mid Atlantic states. During the third quarter of 2001, the economic slowdown began to impact our industrial business servicing the non residential construction industry. Landfill volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity began to weaken. In addition, the slowdown we began to experience in the second quarter in the manufacturing sector became more acute as we experienced significant shift reductions and plant closings in the Southeastern United States, particularly in the textile and home furnishing industries in the Carolinas. These conditions were reflected in our internal growth numbers, which were approximately half of what we experienced in prior quarters. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we continued to see a weakening in waste volumes from the manufacturing sector. We also continued to see a slowdown in commercial construction and special waste activity which resulted in both volume reductions and price sensitivity for these services. Furthermore, we began to see a softening in residential construction activity. 2004 Outlook: We anticipate internal growth from core operations to be 3% during 2004 assuming no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of 2003. However, our price and volume growth may remain flat or may decline in 2004 depending upon economic conditions and our success in implementing our pricing initiative. Cost of Operations. Cost of operations was $1,605.4 million, $1,472.9 million and $1,422.5 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 63.8%, 62.3% and 63.0%, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in aggregate dollars in all periods presented is primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth. The increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily attributable to self insurance expense. This increase in self insurance expense relates to existing claims and is attributable to the expansion of our operations and various changes in estimates as a result of continued negative trends through our current policy year, based on recent actuarial claims experience, expected claims development and medical cost inflation. The increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue is also due to increased fuel prices, an increase in waste taxes levied on landfill volumes in certain states, an increase in revenue generated by lines of business that produce lower operating margins and an increase in the long haul transport of waste by third party vendors. These increases in costs were partially offset by the elimination of closure and post closure expense as a component of cost of operations in accordance with SFAS 143 and the termination of our operating lease facility. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a charge of $86.1 million on an after tax basis, or $132.0 million on a pre tax basis. Of this pre tax amount, $24.2 million was recorded to cost of operations which relates primarily to the downsizing of our compost, mulch and soil business and related inventory adjustments and an increase in self insurance reserves. Excluding the impact of this charge, cost of operations for 2001 was $1,398.3 million, or 61.9% as a percent of revenue. The increase in adjusted cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from 2001 to 2002 is primarily the result of the economic slowdown, higher costs for self insurance, and increased revenue from municipal contracts and transfer stations which have higher operating costs. These increases in cost of operations were partially offset by improved operating efficiencies, higher recycling commodity prices, lower fuel costs and the termination of our operating lease facility. 34 Table of Contents To date in 2004, we have experienced a significant increase in fuel prices. We believe that cost of operations as a percentage of revenue may continue to remain high depending upon the cost of fuel, health insurance, risk insurance and other key components of our cost structure and the severity and duration of the economic slowdown. Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion of Property and Equipment. Depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were $233.8 million, $193.5 million and $168.3 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 9.3%, 8.2% and 7.4%, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to an increase in landfill amortization associated with the adoption of SFAS 143. The remaining increase from 2002 to 2003 and the increase in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue from 2001 to 2002 is due to increased depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures, acquisitions and the purchase of equipment originally placed into service pursuant to an operating lease. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Intangible assets consist primarily of cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired, but also includes values assigned to long term contracts, covenants not to compete and customer relationships. Expenses for amortization of intangible assets were $5.3 million, $6.1 million and $47.1 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, .2%, .2% and 2.1%, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The decrease in aggregate dollars and as a percent of revenue from 2001 to 2002 is due to the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, effective January 1, 2002 under which most of our intangible assets are no longer subject to amortization. Accretion Expense. Accretion expense was $12.7 million or, as a percentage of revenue, .5%, for the year ended December 31, 2003 versus $0 for 2002 and 2001. Accretion expense resulted from the adoption of SFAS 143 as of January 1, 2003. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $247.9 million, $238.7 million and $236.5 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 9.8%, 10.1% and 10.5%, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increases in aggregate dollars are primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth. The decrease as a percentage of revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to leveraging our existing overhead structure over an expanding revenue base. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a charge of $86.1 million on an after tax basis, or $132.0 million on a pre tax basis. Of this pre tax amount, $8.2 million was recorded to selling, general and administrative expenses. Excluding the impact of this charge, selling, general and administrative expenses for 2001 were $228.3 million, or 10.1% as a percent of revenue, which is consistent with 2002. We believe that selling, general and administrative expenses in the range of 10% of revenue are appropriate for 2004 given our business platform. Other Charges. During the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a $5.6 million gain on the sale of certain assets for amounts exceeding estimates originally made during the fourth quarter of 2001. During the fourth quarter of 2001, we recorded a charge of $86.1 million on an after tax basis, or $132.0 million on a pre tax basis. Of this pre tax amount, $99.6 million was recorded to other charges which relates primarily to completed and planned divestitures and closings of certain core and non core businesses and asset impairments. Operating Income. Operating income was $412.7 million, $459.5 million and $283.5 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 16.4%, 19.4% and 12.6%, for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Excluding the impact of the other charges (income) we recorded in the fourth quarters of 2002 and 2001, our operating income was $453.9 million, or 19.2%, and $415.5 million, or 18.4%, for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Interest Expense. We incurred interest expense on our revolving credit facility, unsecured notes and tax exempt bonds. Interest expense was $78.0 million, $77.0 million and $80.1 million for the years ended 35 Table of Contents December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in interest expense from 2002 to 2003 is due to higher debt balances resulting from additional tax exempt financings partially offset by lower interest rates. The decrease in interest expense from 2001 to 2002 is due to a general market decrease in interest rates and an increase in tax exempt financings, which generally bear interest at lower rates than our unsecured notes. The decrease in interest expense is also due to interest rate swap agreements that we entered into during 2001 and 2002. Capitalized interest was $3.3 million, $2.5 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Interest and Other Income (Expense), Net. Interest and other income, net of other expense, was $12.7 million, $4.0 million and $5.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The variances during the periods are primarily due to fluctuations in cash and restricted cash balances and net gains on the disposition of assets during 2003 and 2001. Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes was $132.0 million, $146.9 million and $83.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Our effective income tax rate was 38.0%, 38.0% and 40.0% for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Our effective tax rate for 2001 included certain non tax deductible items related to the charge we recorded during the fourth quarter of 2001. Excluding the impact of this charge, our effective tax rate for 2001 was 38.0%. Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles. During the first quarter of 2003, we adopted SFAS 143. SFAS 143 required us to change the methodology we used to record final capping, closure and post closure costs related to our landfills. As of January 1, 2003, we recorded an after tax expense of $20.8 million, or $33.6 million on a pre tax basis, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of SFAS 143. In addition, we also recorded an after tax expense of $17.0 million, or $27.4 million on a pre tax basis, as a cumulative effect of a change in account principle for our methane gas collection systems. This change in accounting for methane gas collection systems was prompted by a thorough evaluation of our landfill accounting policy in connection with the adoption of SFAS 143 and is consistent with the methodology used by other participants in the waste industry. Landfill and Environmental Matters Among our most significant investments and most valuable assets are our landfills. The additional disclosures included in this section provide the users of our financial statements with a clearer understanding of our investment in our landfills and various accounting principles that are unique to landfill operations. Available Airspace The following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003: Balance as of New Landfills Changes in Changes Balance as of December 31, Expansions Acquired, Net Permits Airspace Engineering In December 31, 2000 Undertaken of Divestitures Granted Consumed Estimates Design 2001 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,355.1 7.5 .7 (32.5 ) (1.8 ) 1,329.0 Number of sites 53 1 54 Expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 299.4 34.7 (26.5 ) .9 51.1 359.6 Number of sites 17 4 (1 ) 20 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,654.5 34.7 (19.0 ) .7 (32.5 ) (.9 ) 51.1 1,688.6 Number of sites 53 1 54 36 Table of Contents Balance as of New Landfills Changes in Changes Balance as of December 31, Expansions Acquired, Net Permits Airspace Engineering In December 31, 2001 Undertaken of Divestitures Granted Consumed Estimates Design 2002 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,329.0 4.9 45.1 (34.6 ) 13.1 .4 1,357.9 Number of sites 54 1 1 56 Expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 359.6 4.3 (35.7 ) (2.1 ) 27.2 353.3 Number of sites 20 2 (2 ) 20 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,688.6 4.3 4.9 9.4 (34.6 ) 11.0 27.6 1,711.2 Number of sites 54 1 1 56 Balance as of New Landfills Changes in Changes Balance as of December 31, Expansions Acquired, Net Permits Airspace Engineering In December 31, 2002 Undertaken of Divestitures Granted Consumed Estimates Design 2003 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,357.9 26.3 154.6 (39.3 ) (.9 ) 1,498.6 Number of sites 56 2 58 Expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 353.3 61.6 (154.1 ) (3.5 ) 11.4 268.7 Number of sites 20 (5 ) 15 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,711.2 61.6 26.3 .5 (39.3 ) (4.4 ) 11.4 1,767.3 Number of sites 56 2 58 Changes in engineering estimates typically include minor modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information. Changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfills footprint or vertical slopes. During 2001, total available airspace increased by 34.1 million cubic yards primarily due to new expansions undertaken and changes in design partially offset by consumption and divestitures. During 2002, total available airspace increased by 22.6 million cubic yards primarily due to the opening of a greenfield site in South Carolina, changes in engineering estimates and changes in design partially offset by consumption. During 2003, total available airspace increased by 56.1 million cubic yards due to new expansions undertaken, two landfills that were acquired during the year and changes in design partially offset by airspace consumption and changes in engineering estimates. As of December 31, 2003, we owned or operated 58 solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 1.8 billion in place cubic yards. Total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace. These estimates are developed annually by engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys. As of December 31, 2003, total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 1.5 billion in place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus .3 billion in place cubic yards of probable expansion airspace. Before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and, therefore, included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity, it must meet our expansion criteria. See Note 3, Accrued Landfill, Environmental and Legal Costs of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2003, fifteen of our landfills meet the criteria for including probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity. At projected annual volumes, these fifteen landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 30 years, including probable expansion airspace. The average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 30 years. As of December 31, 2003, four of our landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace had obtained approval from local authorities and are proceeding into the state permitting process. Also, as of December 31, 2003, six of our fifteen landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace had submitted permit applications to state authorities. The remaining five landfills that meet the criteria for 37 Table of Contents including expansion airspace are in the process of obtaining approval from local authorities and have not identified any fatal flaws or impediments associated with the expansions at either the local or state level. Final Capping, Closure and Post Closure Costs As of January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. This statement required us to change the methodology we used to record final capping, closure and post closure costs. See Note 3, Accrued Landfill, Environmental and Legal Costs, of the Notes to our Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2003, accrued final capping, closure and post closure costs were $204.7 million. The current portion of these costs of $29.5 million is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in other current liabilities. The long term portion of these costs of $175.2 million is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in accrued landfill, environmental and legal costs. Investment in Landfills The following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 and the future expected investment as of December 31, 2003 (in millions): Landfills Balance as of Acquired, Transfers Impaired Additions Balance as of December 31, Capital Net of and Asset Charged to December 31, 2000 Additions Retirements Divestitures Adjustments Write Down Expense 2001 Non depletable landfill land $ 47.2 $ 5.1 $ (.9 ) $ 2.3 $ (2.2 ) $ (1.0 ) $ $ 50.5 Landfill development costs 865.5 5.0 30.7 86.8 (29.2 ) 958.8 Construction in progress landfill 46.6 58.4 (.4 ) (87.0 ) 17.6 Accumulated depletion and amortization (179.5 ) 3.9 .3 (.2 ) (61.5 ) (237.0 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 779.8 $ 68.5 $ (.9 ) $ 36.5 $ (2.1 ) $ (30.4 ) $ (61.5 ) $ 789.9 Landfills Balance as of Acquired, Transfers Additions Balance as of December 31, Capital Net of and Charged to December 31, 2001 Additions Divestitures Adjustments Expense 2002 Non depletable landfill land $ 50.5 $ 3.3 $ $ .2 $ $ 54.0 Landfill development costs 958.8 18.1 5.1 44.3 1,026.3 Construction in progress landfill 17.6 56.0 (41.3 ) 32.3 Accumulated depletion and amortization (237.0 ) .3 (67.4 ) (304.1 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 789.9 $ 77.4 $ 5.1 $ 3.5 $ (67.4 ) $ 808.5 Cumulative Non Cash Effect of Landfills Additions Balance as of Changes in Acquired, Transfers for Asset Additions Balance as of December 31, Accounting Capital Net of and Retirement Charged to December 31, 2002 Principles Additions Divestitures Adjustments Obligations Expense 2003 Non depletable landfill land $ 54.0 $ $ .1 $ .5 $ (5.1 ) $ $ $ 49.5 Landfill development costs 1,026.3 188.6 3.7 28.9 69.8 17.9 1,335.2 Construction in progress landfill 32.3 78.7 (50.2 ) 60.8 Accumulated depletion and amortization (304.1 ) (248.4 ) .7 (92.8 ) (644.6 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 808.5 $ (59.8 ) $ 82.5 $ 29.4 $ 15.2 $ 17.9 $ (92.8 ) $ 800.9 38 Table of Contents Balance as of Expected Total December 31, Future Expected 2003 Investment Investment Non depletable landfill land $ 49.5 $ $ 49.5 Landfill development costs 1,335.2 1,542.2 2,877.4 Construction in progress landfill 60.8 60.8 Accumulated depletion and amortization (644.6 ) (644.6 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 800.9 $ 1,542.2 $ 2,343.1 The following table reflects our net investment in our landfills, excluding non depletable land, and our depletion and amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. It also shows on a pro forma basis what our depletion, amortization and accretion expense would have been if SFAS 143 and the changes in accounting principles relating to our methane gas collection systems were effective on January 1, 2001: Pro Forma Pro Forma 2003 2002 2001 2002 2001 Number of landfills owned or operated 58 56 54 56 54 Net investment, excluding non depletable land (in millions) $ 751.4 $ 754.5 $ 739.4 $ 694.7 $ 679.6 Total estimated available disposal capacity (in millions of cubic yards) 1,767.3 1,711.2 1,688.6 1,711.2 1,688.6 Net investment per cubic yard $ .43 $ .44 $ .44 $ .41 $ .40 Landfill depletion and amortization expense (in millions) $ 92.8 $ 67.4 $ 61.5 $ 86.9 $ 81.2 Accretion expense (in millions) 12.7 10.5 9.0 Closure and post closure expense (in millions) 26.1 22.9 105.5 93.5 84.4 97.4 90.2 Airspace consumed (in millions of cubic yards) 39.3 34.6 32.5 34.6 32.5 Depletion, amortization, accretion, closure and post closure expense per cubic yard of airspace consumed $ 2.68 $ 2.70 $ 2.60 $ 2.82 $ 2.78 During 2003, our weighted average compaction rate for converting cubic yards to tons was approximately 1,500 pounds per cubic yard. As of December 31, 2003, we expect to spend an estimated additional $1,542.2 million on existing landfills, primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures, over their expected remaining lives. Our total expected gross investment, excluding non depletable land, estimated to be $2.3 billion, or $1.30 per cubic yard, is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based upon airspace consumed using the units of consumption method. We accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated. We also accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities associated with properties acquired through business combinations as a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace, as appropriate. No material amounts were charged to expense during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001. Financial Condition One of our key financial objectives is to maintain a simple, cost effective and transparent capital structure. At December 31, 2003, we had $215.0 million of restricted cash deposits and $182.4 million of restricted marketable securities held as financial guarantees, including $104.6 million of restricted cash held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities, and $40.5 million and $182.4 million of restricted cash and restricted marketable securities, respectively, pledged to various regulatory agencies and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our performance related to final capping, closure and post closure obligations at our 39 Table of Contents landfills. Restricted marketable securities consist of mutual funds invested in short term investment grade securities, including mortgage backed securities and U.S. Government obligations. These securities are available for sale and, as a result, are stated at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We intend to liquidate a portion of these marketable securities and use the proceeds to repay the $225.0 million of public notes, which mature in May 2004. We also intend to use letters of credit to replace the financial guarantees secured by marketable securities to be liquidated. In July 1998, we entered into a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks. $500.0 million of the credit facility was scheduled to expire in July 2002 and the remaining $500.0 million was scheduled to expire in July 2003. As a result of our strong financial position and liquidity, in February 2002 we reduced the short and long term portions of our credit facility to $300.0 million and $450.0 million, respectively. In July 2002, we renewed the long and short term portions of our credit facility respectively, on substantially the same terms and conditions with the long term portion expiring in 2007 and the short term portion expiring in 2003. The short term portion of the facility was renewed again in July 2003 and expires in July 2004. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at LIBOR based rates. We use our operating cash flow and proceeds from our credit facilities to finance our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and other requirements. As of December 31, 2003, we had $326.3 million available under our credit facility. In May 1999, we sold $600.0 million of unsecured notes in the public market. $225.0 million of these notes bear interest at 6 5/8% per annum and mature in May 2004. The remaining $375.0 million bear interest at 7 1/8% per annum and mature in 2009. Interest on these notes is payable semi annually in May and November. The $225.0 million and $375.0 million in notes were offered at a discount of $1.0 million and $.5 million, respectively. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility. In December 1999, we entered into an operating lease facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles. In July 2002, we exercised our right to purchase the equipment underlying this facility by paying $72.6 million using our excess cash, which was the balance outstanding under the facility at that time. In August 2001, we sold $450.0 million of unsecured notes in the public market. The notes bear interest at 6 3/4% and mature in 2011. Interest on these notes is payable semi annually in February and August. The notes were offered at a discount of $2.6 million. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility. In order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates and to take advantage of favorable floating interest rates, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment grade rated financial institutions. The swap agreements have total notional values of $225.0 million and $105.0 million, respectively, and require our company to pay interest at floating rates based upon changes in LIBOR and receive interest at fixed rates of 6 5/8% and 6 3/4%, respectively. The swap agreements terminate in May 2004 and August 2011, respectively. At December 31, 2003, we had $463.2 million of tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings outstanding of which approximately $86.0 million were obtained during fiscal 2003. Borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on fixed or floating interest rates at the prevailing market ranging from 1.15% to 5.63% at December 31, 2003 and have maturities ranging from 2004 to 2033. As of December 31, 2003, we had $104.6 million of restricted cash related to proceeds from tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings. This restricted cash will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements. We intend to repay the $225.0 million of public notes that mature in May 2004 using proceeds from the liquidation of our restricted marketable securities, our excess cash, proceeds from our revolving credit facility, or a combination thereof. In addition, we plan to extend the maturity of our revolving short term credit facility prior to its expiration in July 2004 to July 2005. We believe that these actions would provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due. We believe 40 Table of Contents that we would be able to raise additional debt or equity financing, if necessary, to fund special corporate needs or to complete acquisitions. However, we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain additional financing under favorable terms or to extend the existing short term credit facility on the same terms. Selected Balance Sheet Accounts The following tables reflect the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts, final capping, closure, post closure and remediation liabilities and accrued self insurance during the years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 (in millions): Closure, Post Closure Allowance for and Doubtful Accounts Remediation Self Insurance Balance, December 31, 2000 $ 13.2 $ 167.6 $ 41.1 Additions charged to expense 22.8 22.9 130.2 Additions due to acquisitions, net of divestitures 1.5 69.3 Payments or usage (18.5 ) (20.3 ) (113.7 ) Balance, December 31, 2001 19.0 239.5 57.6 Current portion 19.0 21.1 38.4 Long term portion $ $ 218.4 $ 19.2 Closure, Post Closure Allowance for and Doubtful Accounts Remediation Self Insurance Balance, December 31, 2001 $ 19.0 $ 239.5 $ 57.6 Additions charged to expense 11.2 26.1 138.1 Additions due to acquisitions, net of divestitures .2 5.0 Payments or usage (11.4 ) (14.8 ) (120.7 ) Balance, December 31, 2002 19.0 255.8 75.0 Current portion 19.0 22.1 33.9 Long term portion $ $ 233.7 $ 41.1 Final Capping, Closure Allowance for and Doubtful Accounts Post Closure Remediation Self Insurance Balance, December 31, 2002 $ 19.0 $ 196.9 $ 58.9 $ 75.0 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (14.5 ) Asset additions 17.9 Accretion 12.7 Other additions charged to expense 10.4 189.5 Additions due to acquisitions, net of divestitures Payments or usage (10.4 ) (8.3 ) (4.2 ) (142.3 ) Balance, December 31, 2003 19.0 204.7 54.7 122.2 Current portion 19.0 29.5 4.4 47.6 Long term portion $ $ 175.2 $ 50.3 $ 74.6 41 Table of Contents Our expense related to doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue for 2001, 2002 and 2003 was 1.0%, .5% and ..4%, respectively. As of December 31, 2003, accounts receivable were $248.9 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $19.0 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of 35 days, or 23 days net of deferred revenue. In addition, at December 31, 2003, our trade receivables in excess of 90 days old totaled $14.5 million, or 5.4% of gross receivables outstanding. Our expense for self insurance as a percentage of revenue for 2001, 2002 and 2003 was 5.8%, 5.8% and 7.5%, respectively. The increase in self insurance expense from 2002 to 2003 relates to existing claims and is attributable to the expansion of our operations and various changes in estimates as a result of continued negative trends through our current policy year, based on recent actuarial claims experience, expected claims development and medical cost inflation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources The major components of changes in cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 are discussed below. Cash Flows From Operating Activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $600.5 million, $569.7 million and $459.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The changes in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are due to the expansion of our business, 43 Table of Contents deferred taxes and timing of receipts and payments from accounts receivable and accounts payable, respectively. In December 2003, we received written approval from the Internal Revenue Service to exclude probable expansion airspace from our calculation of landfill amortization, depletion, and final capping, closure and post closure costs for tax purposes. As a result of this change, our deferred income tax provision increased by approximately $82.0 million during 2003 and we recorded a tax receivable of approximately $48.0 million. We use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividend payments and debt repayments. Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities. Cash flows used in investing activities consist primarily of cash used for capital additions and business acquisitions. Cash used to acquire businesses, net of cash acquired, was $51.5 million, $55.8 million and $261.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. Capital additions were $273.2 million, $258.6 million and $249.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The increase in restricted marketable securities during 2003 consists of amounts transferred from unrestricted cash for financial guarantees. We intend to liquidate a portion of these marketable securities and use the proceeds to repay the $225.0 million of public notes, which mature in May 2004. We also intend to use letters of credit to replace financial guarantees secured by marketable securities to be liquidated. We intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand, cash flows from operations, our revolving credit facility, tax exempt bonds and other financings. We expect to use primarily cash for future business acquisitions. Cash Flows From (Used In) Financing Activities. Cash flows provided by (used in) financing activities during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 included commercial bank borrowings and repayments of debt in all three years, proceeds from our sale of unsecured notes in 2001, and proceeds from issuances of tax exempt bonds in 2003, 2002 and 2001. In August 2001, we sold unsecured notes with a face value of $450.0 million at a discounted price of $447.4 million. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility. In December 1999, we entered into an operating lease facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles. In July 2002, we retired this facility using our excess cash. During 2000 through 2003, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $675.0 million of our common stock. As of December 31, 2003, we paid $484.3 million to repurchase approximately 25.6 million shares of our stock, of which we paid $184.2 million during 2003 to repurchase approximately 8.4 million shares of our stock. In July 2003, our board of directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend of $.06 per share. In October 2003, we paid a dividend of $9.6 million to shareholders of record as of September 30, 2003. As of December 31, 2003, we recorded a dividend payable of approximately $9.4 million to shareholders of record at the close of business on January 2, 2004 which has been paid. In January 2004, our board of directors declared a regular quarterly dividend of $.06 per share for shareholders of record on April 1, 2004. We used proceeds from our revolving credit facility, unsecured notes and tax exempt bonds to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions and to repay debt. We intend to finance future stock repurchases and dividend payments through cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our revolving credit facility and other financings. Credit Rating Our company has received investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2003, our senior debt was rated, BBB+ by Standard & Poors, BBB+ by Fitch and Baa2 by Moodys. 44 Table of Contents Operating Lease Facility In December 1999, we entered into a $100.0 million facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles. In July 2002, we exercised our right to purchase the equipment underlying this facility by paying $72.6 million using our excess cash, which was the balance outstanding under the facility at that time. Fuel Hedge During June 2001, we entered into option agreements for approximately 14.3 million gallons of heating oil. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, the options qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases. These option agreements settled each month in equal notional amounts through December 2002. The option agreements were structured as zero cost collars indexed to the price of heating oil. These options expired in December 2002. In accordance with SFAS 133, $1.6 million and $(1.6) million, net of tax, representing the effective portion of the change in fair value during the periods have been recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. The ineffective portions of the changes in fair value of approximately $.1 million and $(.1) million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, have been included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Realized losses of $.8 million and $.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively, related to these option agreements are included in cost of operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2003: Maturities of Notes Final Capping, Amounts Due Unconditional Operating Capital Payable and Closure and to Former Purchase Year Ending December 31, Leases Leases Long Term Debt Post Closure Remediation Owners Commitments Total 2004 $ 4.3 $ $ 227.8 $ 29.5 $ 4.4 $ 6.1 $ 29.9 $ 302.0 2005 3.4 2.7 30.0 1.0 12.4 49.5 2006 3.0 2.5 19.8 1.0 11.6 37.9 2007 2.7 2.0 20.5 1.0 3.6 29.8 2008 1.7 1.3 24.9 1.0 2.7 31.6 Thereafter 7.2 25.0 1,257.5 783.9 46.3 17.0 2,136.9 Total $ 22.3 $ 25.0 $ 1,493.8 $ 908.6 $ 54.7 $ 6.1 $ 77.2 $ 2,587.7 Unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of long term disposal agreements that require us to dispose of a minimal number of tons at third party facilities. We do not have or engage in any off balance sheet arrangements. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement. Our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates in the United States 45 Table of Contents and fluctuations in LIBOR. We intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. All items described below are non trading. Expected Maturity Date Fair Value (Asset)/Liability December 31, 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total 2003 VARIABLE RATE DEBT: Amount outstanding (in millions) $ .6 $ .6 $ .3 $ $ $ 343.9 $ 345.4 $ 345.4 Average interest rates 1.6 % 1.6 % 1.6 % 2.01 % 2.01 % INTEREST RATE SWAPS: Amount outstanding (in millions) $ 225.0 $ $ $ $ $ 105.0 $ 330.0 $ (3.3 ) Average interest rates 2.4 % 2.4 % 2.4 % The fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable and, thus, approximate current market rates. Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting standards, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Our free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001 is calculated as follows (in millions): 2003 2002 2001 Cash provided by operating activities $ 600.5 $ 569.7 $ 459.2 Purchases of property and equipment (273.2 ) (258.6 ) (249.3 ) Proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 9.1 14.6 8.7 Free cash flow $ 336.4 $ 325.7 $ 218.6 We believe that the presentation of free cash flow, which is a non GAAP financial measure, provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment, net of proceeds from the sale of equipment. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided, pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment our existing business platform, repurchasing shares of common stock at prices that provide value to our shareholders, paying cash dividends, maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt. In addition, free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation. Free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Seasonality Our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement weather which could delay the collection and disposal of waste, reduce the volume of waste generated or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities. New Accounting Pronouncements In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. FIN 46 introduces a new consolidation model which determines control and consolidation based upon the majority beneficiary of the potential variability in gains and losses of the entity being evaluated. In December 2003, the FASB revised the initial application and certain terms and exemptions in FIN 46. FIN 46 is currently effective for all variable interest entities created or modified after 46 Table of Contents January 31, 2003 and special purpose entities created on or before January 31, 2003. The interpretation is effective for all other variable interest entities beginning March 31, 2004. We have evaluated our organizational structure and have concluded that the portion of FIN 46 that is currently effective has no impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. In addition, we do not expect the portion of FIN 46 that is effective on March 31, 2004 to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. There are no other new accounting pronouncements that pertain to our company. 47 Table of Contents
