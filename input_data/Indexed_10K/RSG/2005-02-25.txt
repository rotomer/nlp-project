ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and their Notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Overview of Our Business We are a leading provider of non hazardous solid waste collection and disposal services in the United States. We provide solid waste collection services for commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers through 140 collection companies in 22 states. We also own or operate 96 transfer stations, 58 solid waste landfills and 35 recycling facilities. We generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations. Our remaining revenue is from other services including landfill disposal, recycling, compost, mulch and soil operations. The following table reflects our revenue by source for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2004 2003 2002 Collection: Residential $ 655.2 24.2 % $ 601.2 23.9 % $ 530.7 22.4 % Commercial 737.9 27.2 706.0 28.0 696.7 29.5 Industrial 558.1 20.6 523.0 20.8 501.6 21.2 Other 62.2 2.3 50.9 2.0 50.8 2.1 Total collection 2,013.4 74.3 1,881.1 74.7 1,779.8 75.2 Transfer and disposal 1,031.0 967.5 854.1 Less: Intercompany (519.8 ) (493.7 ) (428.5 ) Transfer and disposal, net 511.2 18.9 473.8 18.8 425.6 18.0 Other 183.5 6.8 162.9 6.5 159.7 6.8 Revenue $ 2,708.1 100.0 % $ 2,517.8 100.0 % $ 2,365.1 100.0 % Our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers. Our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets derive revenue from long term contracts with municipalities. We generally provide industrial and commercial collection services to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years. Our revenue from landfill services is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties. In general, we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials. No one customer has individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years. The cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes transfer, disposal, labor, self insurance, fuel and equipment maintenance costs. We try to be more efficient by controlling the movement of waste streams from the point of collection through disposal. During the three months ended December 31, 2004, approximately 54% of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate. Our landfill costs include daily operating expenses, costs of capital for cell development, costs for final capping, closure and post closure, and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance. Daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal, methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance, interim cap maintenance and costs associated with the application of daily cover materials. We expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred. We use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to cell development. In life cycle accounting, certain direct costs are capitalized, and charged to expense based upon 23 Table of Contents the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. These costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems, installation of groundwater monitoring wells, and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site. Obligations associated with final capping, closure and post closure are capitalized, and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed. Cost and airspace estimates are developed annually by engineers. These estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to annually adjust our rates used to expense capitalized costs. Changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in available airspace, inflation and applicable regulations. Changes in available airspace include changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted. Our operations are managed and reviewed through five regions which we designate as our reportable segments. From 2003 to 2004, operating income increased in our Eastern, Southern and Western regions due to an overall increase in revenue resulting from the successful execution of our growth strategy. In the Central region, increased revenue was offset by weak economic conditions and an increase in costs related to the long haul transport of waste by third party vendors. In the Southwestern region, revenue growth was impeded by the closure of a landfill and the completion of a special waste contract during 2003. The decrease in costs for Corporate Entities from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to a decrease in self insurance expense. 2004 Financial Objectives In January 2004, we publicly announced our objectives for the year. These objectives included the following: Generating free cash flow of approximately $340 million. Using our free cash flow to repurchase shares of our common stock under our $200.0 million share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in October 2003 and continuing to pay quarterly cash dividends. Generating diluted earnings per share of $1.50 to $1.55. Growing revenue from core operations by 3%, with approximately 2% attributable to price increases and 1% attributable to volume growth. Purchasing approximately $275 million of property and equipment. 2004 Business Performance During 2004, we achieved our earnings per share objective and exceeded our internal growth, free cash flow and share repurchase objectives. Our internal growth from core operations for 2004 was 5.9%, with 2.3% from price increases and 3.6% from volume growth. During 2004, our revenue growth from core pricing benefited from a broad based pricing initiative which we started during the fourth quarter of 2003. We experienced core volume growth in all lines of our business, including our residential collection business resulting from the addition of several new municipal contracts, and our landfill and transfer station businesses resulting from newly opened sites and new contracts. Our core volume growth was also positively impacted by the hurricanes. In addition, our geographic mix of business, which is concentrated in high growth markets, positively impacted our operating results. As a result, during 2004 we were able to exceed the internal growth objectives we established at the beginning of the year. During 2004, our operating margins improved, primarily due to lower self insurance expense. This benefit was partially offset by increased costs for fuel, labor and subcontracting costs associated with the long haul transport of waste by third party vendors. The net expansion in our operating margin allowed us to achieve diluted earnings per share of $1.53 during the year ended December 31, 2004. 24 Table of Contents During 2004, we generated free cash flow of $388.2 million (consisting of cash provided by operating activities of $666.3 million, less purchases of property and equipment of $283.8 million, plus proceeds from the sale of property and equipment of $5.7 million), which substantially exceeded our objective. Our free cash flow was positively impacted by lower than expected cash taxes due to bonus depreciation and our change in tax method related to certain landfill costs. In April 2004, our board of directors increased our share repurchase authorization from $200.0 million to $275.0 million. During 2004, we used our free cash flow to repurchase approximately 9.6 million shares of our common stock for $266.1 million. Also, during the third quarter of 2004, our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend to $.12 per share. 2005 Financial Objectives Our financial objectives for 2005 assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter 2004. Specific guidance is as follows: We expect to generate free cash flow in excess of $260 million. We anticipate using our free cash flow to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock under our $275.0 million share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in October 2004 and to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends. We anticipate diluted earnings per share of $1.65 to $1.70. We are targeting internal growth from core operations to be in the range of 4.0% to 4.5%, with 2.5% attributable to price increases and 1.5% to 2.0% attributable to volume growth. We anticipate purchasing approximately $300 million of property and equipment. We expect our free cash flow during 2005 to be lower than 2004 and 2003 because of higher tax payments due to the reversal of bonus depreciation, higher purchases of property and equipment and several one time items that benefited previous periods, including utilization of a tax receivable and the collection of a note receivable during 2004, and an increase in self insurance reserves during 2003. 2005 Business Initiatives Our business initiatives for 2005 are generally a continuation of those initiated in the prior three years and are dependent on further standardizing our business processes and improving our systems. Ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and processes and are trained on our new systems is essential to the overall success of our initiatives. Our business initiatives for 2005 are as follows: Pricing initiatives. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we implemented a broad based pricing initiative across all lines of our business. The purpose of this initiative is to recover increasing costs and improve operating margins. We realized the benefit of this initiative during 2004 and expect a similar benefit during 2005. Improve the quality of our revenue. The first step in this process was completed in 2001 and included installing a standardized billing and operating system. This system enables us to, among other things, stratify our customers to determine how our rates compare to current market pricing. During 2002, we implemented the second generation of this software which we call RSI 1.0. RSI 1.0, our companys core business system, provides a variety of functionalities including customer service, dispatch, billing, sales analysis, account retention and route productivity analysis. During 2005, we will begin to develop the next generation of our billing and operating system. This system will provide additional functionality to our operating locations and further standardize our billing and operating processes. We currently monitor our return on investment by market place and have instituted a return on investment pricing model. This model will eventually allow us to track our return on investment by customer. 25 Table of Contents During 2001, we also implemented a customer relationship management system. This system improves the productivity of our sales force by helping to establish marketing priorities and track sales leads. It also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial, industrial and franchise contracts. During 2005, we will continue to ensure our sales force is properly trained on this system and is using it as intended. Improve the productivity of our operations. We use a grid productivity program that enables us to benchmark the performance of our drivers. In addition, in our larger markets, we use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and improve operational density. During 2005, we will continue to update our disposal optimization metrics. These metrics identify which local disposal option maximizes our return on invested capital and cash flow. Improve fleet management and procurement. In February 2002, we selected Dossier as our fleet management and parts procurement system. During 2003, we implemented Dossier at all of our significant hauling and landfill operations. Among other features, this system tracks parts inventories, generates automatic quantity order points and logs all maintenance work. It allows us to capture and review information to ensure our preventive maintenance programs comply with manufacturers warranties and governmental regulations. In addition, the purchase order module within this system allows us to cross reference purchasing information with our inventory. During 2005, we intend to further utilize this purchase order module to take advantage of volume discounts. Enhance operational and financial reporting systems. We have several initiatives aimed at improving our operational and financial reporting systems. The overall goal of these initiatives is to provide us with detailed information, prepared in a consistent manner, that will allow us to quickly analyze and act upon trends in our business. One of our most significant systems is our enterprise wide general ledger package. We successfully converted all of our locations to Lawson general ledger software in 2002 and in 2003 successfully converted all of our locations to Lawson fixed asset software. All of the system initiatives mentioned above will provide us with more consistent and detailed information, thus allowing us to make quicker and more informed business decisions. In addition, during 2001, all of our significant software applications were standardized and centralized at our data center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This standardization and centralization provides us with consolidated information concerning our operations across a variety of operational and financial disciplines. It also significantly enhances our ability to execute our disaster recovery plan, if necessary. Expand our safety training programs. As part of our ongoing emphasis on safe work practices and in light of increasing insurance costs, we expanded our safety training programs in 2002. During 2004, we distributed to all of our locations a comprehensive training and safety manual. Safety will continue to be a key area of focus during 2005. Develop and implement performance strategies. Develop and implement strategies to improve the performance of locations and lines of business that are performing below the companys average. 26 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies and Disclosures Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management. The following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Landfill Accounting: Life Cycle Accounting We use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain landfill costs over the life of the site. In life cycle accounting, all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized, and charged to expense based upon the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. Obligations associated with final capping, closure and post closure are capitalized, and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed. Cost and airspace estimates are developed annually by engineers. Changes in these estimates could significantly affect our amortization, depletion, and accretion expense. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Landfill and Environmental Matters. Note 3, Accrued Landfill and Environmental Costs in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Probable Expansion Airspace We include in our calculation of total available airspace expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood that the expansion area will ultimately be permitted. We have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace. We believe that satisfying each of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted. However, because some of these criteria are judgmental, they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted. In either of these scenarios, our amortization, depletion, and accretion expense could change significantly. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Landfill and Environmental Matters. Note 3, Accrued Landfill and Environmental Costs in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 27 Table of Contents Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Final Capping, Closure and Post Closure Prior to January 1, 2003, costs for final closure of our landfills and costs for providing required post closure monitoring and maintenance were charged to cost of operations based upon consumed airspace using the units of consumption method. These costs were not inflated or discounted to the present value of total estimated costs. On January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Under SFAS 143, obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event. Obligations related to closure and post closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire landfill life. Landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units of consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed throughout the entire landfill, depending upon the nature of the obligation. All obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value. Fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and the companys credit adjusted, risk free rate. Total future costs for capping, closure and post closure are developed annually by engineers. Changes in these estimates could affect our amortization of final capping, closure and post closure costs and our accretion expense.

Note 3, Accrued Landfill and Environmental Costs in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 28 Table of Contents Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Self Insurance: Our insurance programs for workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured. Self insurance accruals are based on claims reported and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported. Estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported are developed actuarially. If actual claims experience or development is significantly different than our estimates, our self insurance expense would change. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Selected Balance Sheet Accounts. Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Property and Equipment: Expenditures for Improvements, Repairs and Maintenance Expenditures for major additions and improvements to facilities are capitalized. All expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred. Whether certain expenditures improve an asset or lengthen its useful life is subject to our judgment. Accordingly, the actual useful lives of our assets could differ from our estimates. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Property and Equipment. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Useful Lives Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization expense are provided over the estimated useful lives of the applicable assets using the straight line method. The estimated useful lives are seven to forty years for buildings and improvements, five to twelve years for vehicles, seven to ten years for most landfill equipment, three to fifteen years for all other equipment, and five to twelve years for furniture and fixtures. Our estimates regarding the useful lives of our depreciable assets are based on our judgment. Accordingly, actual useful lives could differ from our estimates. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Property and Equipment. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 29 Table of Contents Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Capitalized Interest We capitalize interest on landfill cell construction and other construction projects in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost. Capitalizing too little or too much interest expense could lead to a misstatement of interest expense in the statement of income. In order to minimize this risk, construction projects must meet the following criteria before interest is capitalized: 1. Total construction costs are $50,000 or greater, 2. the construction phase is one month or longer, and 3. the assets have a useful life of one year or longer. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Property and Equipment. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue and Accounts Receivable: Revenue consists primarily of collection fees from various customer types and transfer and landfill disposal fees charged to third parties. Advance billings are recorded as deferred revenue. Revenue is recognized over the period in which services are provided. No one customer has individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the past three years. Reserves for accounts receivable are provided when a receivable is believed to be uncollectible or generally when a receivable is in excess of 90 days old. Establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our accounts receivable reserve is a matter of judgment. If our judgment and estimates concerning the adequacy of our reserve for accounts receivable is incorrect, bad debt expense would change.

Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 30 Table of Contents Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Derivatives: From time to time, we use derivatives to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and diesel fuel prices. These derivatives have been accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The hedging relationships we have entered into are expected to be either 100% effective or highly effective and have been determined to meet the criteria for hedge accounting. If, in the future, these relationships are no longer expected to be 100% or highly effective, or if they no longer meet the criteria for hedge accounting, our results of operations could change. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition and Fuel Hedge. Note 5, Debt, and Note 11, Fuel Hedge in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 31 Table of Contents Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Long Lived Asset Impairments: Long lived assets consist primarily of property, equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets. We periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred (as further described in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements) that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life of long lived assets or whether the remaining balance of these assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. We use an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the assets in assessing their recoverability. In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. In testing for impairment, we estimate the fair value of each operating segment of our business and compare the fair values with the carrying values. If the fair value of an operating segment is greater than its carrying value, no impairment results. We measure impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or operating segment exceeds its fair value. Our estimates of future cash flows and fair values are based on our judgment. Accordingly, we could designate certain assets as impaired that are not and fail to identify certain impaired assets.

Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 4, Business Combinations in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 32 Table of Contents Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Income Taxes: We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Accordingly, deferred taxes have been provided to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. After the initial recognition of a deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance is provided if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and the realizability of net operating losses for tax purposes are based upon our judgment. If our judgment and estimates concerning valuation allowances and the realizability of net operating losses are incorrect, our provision for income taxes would change. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 6, Income Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Combinations We make decisions to acquire or invest in businesses based on financial and strategic considerations. Businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. We acquired various solid waste businesses during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. The aggregate purchase prices we paid for these transactions was $47.4 million, $51.5 million and $55.8 million, respectively. Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) for 2004 acquisitions totaled approximately $13.2 million. As of December 31, 2004 we had goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,562.7 million. During 2004, $28.2 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace. As of December 31, 2004, we had $743.6 million of landfill development costs, net of accumulated depletion and amortization, which includes purchase price allocated to landfill airspace as well as other capitalized landfill costs. When a landfill is acquired as part of a group of assets, purchase price is allocated to airspace based upon the discounted expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within the acquired group and is adjusted for other non depletable landfill assets and liabilities acquired (primarily final capping, closure and post closure liabilities). Landfill purchase price is amortized using the units of consumption method over total available airspace, which includes probable expansion airspace where appropriate. 33 Table of Contents Goodwill for 2003 acquisitions totaled approximately $21.2 million. As of December 31, 2003, we had goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,558.1 million. $27.7 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace. Goodwill for 2002 acquisitions totaled approximately $40.1 million. As of December 31, 2002, we had goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,544.2 million. Consolidated Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 Our income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles was $237.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2004, as compared to $215.4 million in 2003 and $239.6 million in 2002. Net income was $237.9 million for year ended December 31, 2004, or $1.53 per diluted share, as compared to $177.6 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, in 2003 and $239.6 million, or $1.44 per diluted share, in 2002. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes an after tax expense of $37.8 million (net of an income tax benefit of $23.1 million), or $.23 per share, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, and a change in accounting principle for our methane gas collection systems. See Note 1, Basis of Presentation, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these changes in accounting principles. Our operating results for the year ended December 31, 2002 include other charges (income) described below. The following table summarizes our costs and expenses in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue for 2002 through 2004: 2004 2003 2002 $ % $ % $ % Revenue $ 2,708.1 100.0 % $ 2,517.8 100.0 % $ 2,365.1 100.0 % Cost of operations 1,714.4 63.3 1,605.4 63.8 1,472.9 62.3 Depreciation, amortization and depletion of property and equipment 252.4 9.3 233.8 9.3 193.5 8.2 Amortization of intangible assets 7.0 .3 5.3 .2 6.1 .2 Accretion 13.7 .5 12.7 .5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 268.3 9.9 247.9 9.8 238.7 10.1 Other charges (income) (5.6 ) (.2 ) Operating income $ 452.3 16.7 % $ 412.7 16.4 % $ 459.5 19.4 % Revenue. Revenue was $2,708.1 million, $2,517.8 million and $2,365.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Revenue increased by $190.3 million, or 7.6%, from 2003 to 34 Table of Contents 2004. Revenue increased by $152.7 million, or 6.5%, from 2002 to 2003. The following table reflects the components of our revenue growth for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: 2004 2003 2002 Core price 2.3 % 1.8 % 1.4 % Fuel surcharges .2 .2 Recycling commodities .5 .1 .4 Total price 3.0 2.1 1.8 Core volume 3.6 2.1 1.6 Non core volume .1 .4 Total volume 3.7 2.1 2.0 Total internal growth 6.7 4.2 3.8 Acquisitions .9 1.8 .8 Taxes(a) .5 .2 Total revenue growth 7.6 % 6.5 % 4.8 % (a) Represents new taxes levied on landfill volumes in certain states that are passed on to customers. 2004: During the year ended December 31, 2004, our revenue growth from core pricing benefited from a broad based pricing initiative which we started during the fourth quarter of 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we experienced core volume growth in all lines of our business, including our residential collection business resulting from the addition of several new municipal contracts, and our landfill and transfer station businesses resulting from newly opened sites and new contracts. Our internal growth from our core operations was 5.9% in 2004. 2003: During the first three quarters of 2003, we experienced moderate growth in revenue due to an increase in core pricing. During the fourth quarter of 2003, our revenue growth from core pricing increased at a more rapid pace due to our broad based pricing initiative. During 2003, the economic slowdown which began during 2001 continued to negatively impact our business. However, during 2003, our revenue growth from core volume continued to be positively impacted by long term franchise and municipal contracts that were secured during 2002. Our internal growth from core operations was 3.9% in 2003. 2002: The economic slowdown which began in 2001 continued to negatively impact the portion of our business servicing the manufacturing sector and non residential construction industry during 2002. Volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity continued to weaken during 2002. The weakness in our business attributable to the economic slowdown was partially offset by an increase in recycling commodity prices in the early part of 2002. Despite the weakness we experienced in the aspects of our business noted above, our internal growth from core operations for 2002 was 3.0%. During 2002, we secured several long term franchise and municipal contracts. We also benefited from the geographic mix of our business which favors high growth markets. 2005 Outlook: We anticipate internal growth from core operations to be in the range of 4.0% to 4.5% during 2005 assuming no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of 2004. However, our price and volume growth may remain flat or may decline in 2005 depending upon economic conditions and our success in implementing pricing initiatives. Cost of Operations. Cost of operations was $1,714.4 million, $1,605.4 million and $1,472.9 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 63.3%, 63.8% and 62.3%, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 35 Table of Contents The increase in aggregate dollars in all periods presented is primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through internal growth and acquisitions. The increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from 2002 to 2003 and the decrease in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily attributable to higher self insurance expense in 2003. Self insurance expense was $165.3 million, $189.5 million and $138.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in self insurance expense in 2003 related to existing claims and was attributable to the expansion of our operations and various changes in estimates as a result of continued negative trends through the 2003 policy year. Excluding self insurance expense, cost of operations as a percentage of revenue increased during the year ended December 31, 2004 versus the comparable 2003 period. This increase is primarily attributable to increased fuel prices, labor costs and subcontracting costs associated with the long haul transport of waste by third party vendors. Excluding self insurance expense, cost of operations as a percentage of revenue decreased in 2003 versus the comparable 2002 period due to the elimination of closure and post closure expense as a component of cost of operations in accordance with SFAS 143 in 2003 and the termination of our operating lease facility in July 2002. This decrease was partially offset by increased fuel prices, an increase in waste taxes levied on landfill volumes in certain states, an increase in revenue generated by lines of business that produce lower operating margins and an increase in the long haul transport of waste by third party vendors. To date in 2005, we have experienced a significant increase in fuel prices. We believe that cost of operations as a percentage of revenue may continue to remain high depending upon the cost of fuel, health insurance, risk insurance and other key components of our cost structure and general economic conditions. Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion of Property and Equipment. Depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were $252.4 million, $233.8 million and $193.5 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 9.3%, 9.3% and 8.2%, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in aggregate dollars from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to the expansion of our operations through internal growth and acquisitions. The increase in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to an increase in landfill amortization associated with the adoption of SFAS 143. The remaining increase from 2002 to 2003 is due to increased depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures, acquisitions and the purchase of equipment originally placed into service pursuant to an operating lease. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Intangible assets consist primarily of cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired, but also includes values assigned to long term contracts, covenants not to compete and customer relationships. Expenses for amortization of intangible assets were $7.0 million, $5.3 million and $6.1 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, .3%, .2% and .2%, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to amortization expense on amounts that were recorded in other intangible assets during the three months ended September 30, 2004 resulting from an extensive internal review of all recent acquisitions. The increase in amortization of intangible assets in aggregate dollars is also due to the amortization of intangible assets associated with businesses acquired during 2004. Accretion expense. Accretion expense was $13.7 million and $12.7 million or, as a percentage of revenue, .5% and .5%, for the years ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, versus $0 for 2002. Accretion expense resulted from the adoption of SFAS 143 as of January 1, 2003. The increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars in 2004 is primarily due to expansion of our landfill operations. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $268.3 million, $247.9 million and $238.7 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 9.9%, 9.8% and 10.1%, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increases in aggregate dollars are primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through internal growth and acquisitions. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to higher compensation costs. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from 2002 to 2003 is primarily due to leveraging our existing overhead structure over an expanding revenue base. 36 Table of Contents We believe that selling, general and administrative expenses in the range of 10% of revenue are appropriate for 2005 given our business platform. Other Charges (Income). During the fourth quarter of 2002, we recorded a $5.6 million gain on the sale of certain assets for amounts exceeding estimates originally made and recorded as other charges during the fourth quarter of 2001. Operating Income. Operating income was $452.3 million, $412.7 million and $459.5 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 16.7%, 16.4% and 19.4%, for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest Expense. We incurred interest expense on our unsecured notes and tax exempt bonds. Interest expense was $76.7 million, $78.0 million and $77.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In May 2004, $225.0 million of our public notes matured and were repaid resulting in a reduction in interest expense, which was partially offset by increases in interest expense resulting from additional tax exempt financing obtained during 2004. The increase in interest expense from 2002 to 2003 is due to higher debt balances resulting from additional tax exempt financings partially offset by lower interest rates. Capitalized interest was $2.1 million, $3.3 million and $2.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Interest Income and Other Income (Expense), Net. Interest income and other income, net of other expense, was $8.1 million, $12.7 million and $4.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The variances during the periods are primarily due to fluctuations in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities balances and net gains on the disposition of assets during 2003. In May 2004, we used a portion of our outstanding cash and restricted cash and marketable securities balances to repay $225.0 million of public notes. Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes was $145.8 million, $132.0 million and $146.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Our effective income tax rate was 38.0% for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles. During the first quarter of 2003, we adopted SFAS 143. SFAS 143 required us to change the methodology we used to record final capping, closure and post closure costs related to our landfills. As of January 1, 2003, we recorded an after tax expense of $20.8 million, or $33.6 million on a pre tax basis, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of SFAS 143. In addition, we also recorded an after tax expense of $17.0 million, or $27.4 million on a pre tax basis, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for our methane gas collection systems. This change in accounting principle for methane gas collection systems was prompted by a thorough evaluation of our landfill accounting policy in connection with the adoption of SFAS 143 and is consistent with the methodology used by other participants in the waste industry. 37 Table of Contents Landfill and Environmental Matters Available Airspace The following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002: Balance as of New Landfills Permits Changes in Changes Balance as of December 31, Expansions Acquired, Net Granted, Net Airspace Engineering in December 31, 2001 Undertaken of Divestitures of Closures Consumed Estimates Design 2002 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,329.0 4.9 45.1 (34.6 ) 13.1 .4 1,357.9 Number of sites 54 1 1 56 Expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 359.6 4.3 (35.7 ) (2.1 ) 27.2 353.3 Number of sites 20 2 (2 ) 20 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,688.6 4.3 4.9 9.4 (34.6 ) 11.0 27.6 1,711.2 Number of sites 54 1 1 56 Balance as of New Landfills Permits Changes in Changes Balance as of December 31, Expansions Acquired, Net Granted, Net Airspace Engineering In December 31, 2002 Undertaken of Divestitures of Closures Consumed Estimates Design 2003 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,357.9 26.3 154.6 (39.3 ) (.9 ) 1,498.6 Number of sites 56 2 58 Expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 353.3 61.6 (154.1 ) (3.5 ) 11.4 268.7 Number of sites 20 (5 ) 15 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,711.2 61.6 26.3 .5 (39.3 ) (4.4 ) 11.4 1,767.3 Number of sites 56 2 58 Balance as of Landfills Permits Changes in Changes Balance as of December 31, Acquired, Net Granted, Net Airspace Engineering In December 31, 2003 of Divestitures of Closures Consumed Estimates Design 2004 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,498.6 24.4 48.6 (42.1 ) .1 1,529.6 Number of sites 58 1 (1 ) 58 Expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 268.7 (48.6 ) .1 2.0 222.2 Number of sites 15 (3 ) 12 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,767.3 24.4 (42.1 ) .2 2.0 1,751.8 Number of sites 58 1 (1 ) 58 Changes in engineering estimates typically include minor modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information. Changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfills footprint or vertical slopes. During 2002, total available airspace increased by 22.6 million cubic yards primarily due to the opening of a greenfield site in South Carolina, changes in engineering estimates and changes in design partially offset by consumption. During 2003, total available airspace increased by 56.1 million cubic yards due to new expansions undertaken, two landfills that were acquired during the year and changes in design partially offset by airspace consumption and changes in engineering estimates. During 2004, total available airspace decreased by 15.5 million cubic yards primarily due to airspace consumption partially offset by the acquisition of a landfill. As of December 31, 2004, we owned or operated 58 solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 1.7 billion in place cubic yards. Total available disposal capacity represents the sum 38 Table of Contents of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace. These estimates are developed annually by engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys. As of December 31, 2004, total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 1.5 billion in place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus .2 billion in place cubic yards of probable expansion airspace. Before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and, therefore, included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity, it must meet our expansion criteria. See Note 3, Accrued Landfill and Environmental Costs of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2004, twelve of our landfills meet the criteria for including probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity. At projected annual volumes, these twelve landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 30 years, including probable expansion airspace. The average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 30 years. The following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of December 31, 2004: Number of Sites without Number of Sites with Total Percent Expansion Airspace Expansion Airspace Sites of Total 0 to 5 years 6 1 7 12 % 5+ to 10 years 6 0 6 11 10+ to 20 years 11 2 13 22 20+ to 40 years 12 7 19 33 40+ years 11 2 13 22 Total 46 12 58 100 % Sites with expansion airspace include four landfills with less than five years of remaining permitted airspace. Final Capping, Closure and Post Closure Costs As of January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. This statement required us to change the methodology we used to record final capping, closure and post closure costs. See Note 3, Accrued Landfill and Environmental Costs, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2004, accrued final capping, closure and post closure costs were $216.8 million. The current portion of these costs of $14.6 million is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in other current liabilities. The long term portion of these costs of $202.2 million is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs. 39 Table of Contents Investment in Landfills The following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 and the future expected investment as of December 31, 2004 (in millions): Balance as of Transfers Additions Balance as of December 31, Capital Landfill and Charged to December 31, 2001 Additions Acquisitions Adjustments Expense 2002 Non depletable landfill land $ 50.5 $ 3.3 $ $ .2 $ $ 54.0 Landfill development costs 958.8 18.1 5.1 44.3 1,026.3 Construction in progress landfill 17.6 56.0 (41.3 ) 32.3 Accumulated depletion and amortization (237.0 ) .3 (67.4 ) (304.1 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 789.9 $ 77.4 $ 5.1 $ 3.5 $ (67.4 ) $ 808.5 Cumulative Non Cash Effect of Additions Balance as of Changes in Transfers for Asset Additions Balance as of December 31, Accounting Capital Landfill and Retirement Charged to December 31, 2002 Principles Additions Acquisitions Adjustments Obligations Expense 2003 Non depletable landfill land $ 54.0 $ $ .1 $ .5 $ (5.1 ) $ $ $ 49.5 Landfill development costs 1,026.3 188.6 3.7 28.9 69.8 17.9 1,335.2 Construction in progress landfill 32.3 78.7 (50.2 ) 60.8 Accumulated depletion and amortization (304.1 ) (248.4 ) .7 (92.8 ) (644.6 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 808.5 $ (59.8 ) $ 82.5 $ 29.4 $ 15.2 $ 17.9 $ (92.8 ) $ 800.9 Non Cash Additions Balance as of Transfers for Asset Additions Balance as of December 31, Capital Landfill and Retirement Charged to December 31, 2003 Additions Retirements Acquisitions Adjustments Obligations Expense 2004 Non depletable landfill land $ 49.5 $ 1.0 $ $ 1.5 $ 1.4 $ $ $ 53.4 Landfill development costs 1,335.2 6.6 (1.9 ) 28.9 102.4 15.3 1,486.5 Construction in progress landfill 60.8 78.9 (100.6 ) 39.1 Accumulated depletion and amortization (644.6 ) 1.9 (1.0 ) (.8 ) (98.4 ) (742.9 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 800.9 $ 86.5 $ $ 29.4 $ 2.4 $ 15.3 $ (98.4 ) $ 836.1 Balance as of Expected Total December 31, Future Expected 2004 Investment Investment Non depletable landfill land $ 53.4 $ $ 53.4 Landfill development costs 1,486.5 1,524.1 3,010.6 Construction in progress landfill 39.1 39.1 Accumulated depletion and amortization (742.9 ) (742.9 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 836.1 $ 1,524.1 $ 2,360.2 40 Table of Contents The following table reflects our net investment in our landfills, excluding non depletable land, and our depletion, amortization and accretion expense for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. It also shows on a pro forma basis what our depletion, amortization and accretion expense would have been if SFAS 143 and the changes in accounting principles relating to our methane gas collection systems were effective on January 1, 2002: Years Ended December 31, Pro Forma 2004 2003 2002 2002 Number of landfills owned or operated 58 58 56 56 Net investment, excluding non depletable land (in millions) $ 782.7 $ 751.4 $ 694.7 $ 754.5 Total estimated available disposal capacity (in millions of cubic yards) 1,751.8 1,767.3 1,711.2 1,711.2 Net investment per cubic yard $ .45 $ .43 $ .41 $ .44 Landfill depletion and amortization expense (in millions) $ 98.4 $ 92.8 $ 86.9 $ 67.4 Accretion expense (in millions) 13.7 12.7 10.5 Closure and post closure expense (in millions) 26.1 112.1 105.5 97.4 93.5 Airspace consumed (in millions of cubic yards) 42.1 39.3 34.6 34.6 Depletion, amortization, accretion, closure and post closure expense per cubic yard of airspace consumed $ 2.66 $ 2.68 $ 2.82 $ 2.70 During the twelve months ended December 31, 2004 and 2003, our weighted average compaction rate was approximately 1,500 pounds per cubic yard. As of December 31, 2004, we expect to spend an estimated additional $1,524.1 million on existing landfills, primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures, over their expected remaining lives. Our total expected gross investment, excluding non depletable land, estimated to be $2.3 billion, or $1.32 per cubic yard, is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based upon airspace consumed using the units of consumption method. We accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated. We also accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities associated with properties acquired through business combinations as a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace, as appropriate. No significant amounts were charged to expense during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002. Financial Condition At December 31, 2004, we had $237.0 million of restricted cash deposits and $38.7 million of restricted marketable securities held as financial guarantees, including $119.0 million of restricted cash held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities, and $34.3 million and $38.7 million of restricted cash and restricted marketable securities, respectively, pledged to various regulatory agencies and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our performance related to final capping, closure and post closure obligations at our landfills. Restricted marketable securities consist of mutual funds invested in short term investment grade securities, including mortgage backed securities and U.S. Government obligations. These securities are available for sale and, as a result, are stated at fair value based upon quoted market prices. Unrealized gains and losses, net of tax, are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). We liquidated a portion of these marketable securities and used the proceeds to repay the $225.0 million of public notes, which matured in May 2004. In July 1998, we entered into a $1.0 billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks. $500.0 million of the credit facility was scheduled to expire in July 2002 and the remaining $500.0 million was scheduled to expire in July 2003. As a result of our strong financial position and liquidity, in February 2002 we 41 Table of Contents reduced the short and long term portions of our credit facility to $300.0 million and $450.0 million, respectively. In July 2002, we renewed the long and short term portions of our credit facility respectively, on substantially the same terms and conditions with the long term portion expiring in 2007 and the short term portion expiring in 2003. The short term portion of the facility was renewed again in July 2003 and 2004 and expires in June 2005. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at LIBOR based rates. We use our operating cash flow and proceeds from our tax exempt debt financings to finance our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and other requirements. As of December 31, 2004, we had $373.4 million available under our credit facility. In May 1999, we sold $600.0 million of unsecured notes in the public market. $225.0 million of these notes bore interest at 65/8% per annum and matured in May 2004. The remaining $375.0 million bear interest at 71/8% per annum and mature in 2009. Interest on the outstanding notes is payable semi annually in May and November. The $225.0 million and $375.0 million in notes were offered at a discount of $1.0 million and $.5 million, respectively. In December 1999, we entered into an operating lease facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles. In July 2002, we exercised our right to purchase the equipment underlying this facility by paying $72.6 million using our excess cash, which was the balance outstanding under the facility at that time. In August 2001, we sold $450.0 million of unsecured notes in the public market. The notes bear interest at 63/4% and mature in 2011. Interest on these notes is payable semi annually in February and August. The notes were offered at a discount of $2.6 million. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility. In order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates and to take advantage of favorable floating interest rates, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment grade rated financial institutions. The swap agreements have total notional values of $225.0 million and $210.0 million, respectively, and require our company to pay interest at floating rates based upon changes in LIBOR and receive interest at fixed rates of 65/8% and 63/4%, respectively. Swap agreements with a notional value of $225.0 million matured in May 2004, and agreements with a notional value of $210.0 million mature in August 2011. At December 31, 2004, we had $527.3 million of tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings outstanding of which approximately $65.5 million were obtained during fiscal 2004. Borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on fixed or floating interest rates at the prevailing market ranging from 2% to 51/4% at December 31, 2004 and have maturities ranging from 2005 to 2037. As of December 31, 2004, we had $119.0 million of restricted cash related to proceeds from tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings. This restricted cash will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements. On February 16, 2005, we commenced an offer to the holders of our 71/8% unsecured notes due 2009 to exchange up to $275.0 million aggregate principal amount of such notes for a like principal amount of new notes due 2035. This offering is conditioned upon receiving valid tenders of at least $175.0 million of the aggregate principal of existing notes. These new notes will bear interest at a rate equal to the sum of: (a) the bid side yield on the 5.375% U.S. Treasury Note due February 15, 2031, calculated on the second business day prior to the expiration date of our exchange offering, and (b) 130 basis points. The total exchange price for the old notes is intended to result in a yield to maturity on the settlement date equal to the sum of: (a) the bid side yield on the 3.875% U.S. Treasury Note due May 15, 2009, calculated on the second business day prior to the expiration date, and (b) 35 basis points. The exchange offering is expected to close March 16, 2005, unless further extended by us. However, we cannot assure you that the conditions to the exchange offering will be met and the transaction will be consummated. We plan to extend the maturity of our revolving short term credit facility prior to its expiration in June 2005 to June 2006 or later. We believe that these actions would provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due. We believe that we would be able 42 Table of Contents to raise additional debt or equity financing, if necessary, to fund special corporate needs or to complete acquisitions. However, we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain additional financing under favorable terms or to extend the existing short term credit facility on the same terms. Selected Balance Sheet Accounts The following tables reflect the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts, final capping, closure, post closure and remediation liabilities and accrued self insurance during the years ended December 31, 2002, 2003 and 2004 (in millions): Closure, Post Closure Allowance for and Doubtful Accounts Remediation Self Insurance Balance, December 31, 2001 $ 19.0 $ 239.5 $ 57.6 Additions charged to expense 11.2 26.1 138.1 Additions due to acquisitions, net of divestitures .2 5.0 Payments or usage (11.4 ) (14.8 ) (120.7 ) Balance, December 31, 2002 19.0 255.8 75.0 Current portion 19.0 22.1 33.9 Long term portion $ $ 233.7 $ 41.1 Final Capping, Allowance for Closure and Doubtful Accounts Post Closure Remediation Self Insurance Balance, December 31, 2002 $ 19.0 $ 196.9 $ 58.9 $ 75.0 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (14.5 ) Non cash asset additions 17.9 Accretion expense 12.7 Other additions charged to expense 10.4 189.5 Payments or usage (10.4 ) (8.3 ) (4.2 ) (142.3 ) Balance, December 31, 2003 19.0 204.7 54.7 122.2 Current portion 19.0 29.5 4.4 47.6 Long term portion $ $ 175.2 $ 50.3 $ 74.6 Final Capping, Allowance for Closure and Doubtful Accounts Post Closure Remediation Self Insurance Balance, December 31, 2003 $ 19.0 $ 204.7 $ 54.7 $ 122.2 Non cash asset additions 19.6 Revisions in estimates of future cash flows recorded as non cash asset additions (4.3 ) Accretion expense 13.7 Other additions charged to expense 8.0 1.7 165.3 Additions due to acquisitions .6 Payments or usage (9.0 ) (17.5 ) (2.4 ) (143.7 ) Balance, December 31, 2004 18.0 216.8 54.0 143.8 Current portion 18.0 14.6 2.7 47.4 Long term portion $ $ 202.2 $ 51.3 $ 96.4 43 Table of Contents Our expense related to doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue for 2002, 2003 and 2004 was .5%, .4% and .3%, respectively. As of December 31, 2004, accounts receivable were $268.7 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $18.0 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of 35 days, or 22 days net of deferred revenue. In addition, at December 31, 2004, our trade receivables in excess of 90 days old totaled $16.4 million, or 5.7% of gross receivables outstanding. Our expense for self insurance as a percentage of revenue for 2002, 2003 and 2004 was 5.8%, 7.5% and 6.1%, respectively. The increase in self insurance expense from 2002 to 2003 related to existing claims and was attributable to the expansion of our operations and various changes in estimates as a result of continued negative trends through our 2003 policy year, based on recent actuarial claims experience, expected claims development and medical cost inflation.

Liquidity and Capital Resources The major components of changes in cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 are discussed below. Cash Flows From Operating Activities. Cash flows provided by operating activities were $666.3 million, $600.5 million and $569.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The changes in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are due to the expansion of our business, the timing of payments received for accounts receivable, and the timing of payments for accounts payable and income taxes. In December 2003, we received written approval from the Internal Revenue Service to exclude probable expansion airspace from our calculation of landfill amortization, depletion, and final capping, closure and post closure costs for tax purposes. As a result of this change, we recorded a tax receivable of approximately $48.0 million which was collected or used to offset taxes payable during the year ended December 31, 2004. Also during the year ended December 31, 2004, we collected a $23.0 million note receivable associated with a divested business. We expect our cash flow from operating activities during 2005 to be lower than 2004 and 2003 because of higher tax payments due to the reversal of bonus depreciation and several one time items that benefited previous periods, including utilization of a tax receivable and the collection of a note receivable during 2004, and an increase in self insurance reserves during 2003. We use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividend payments and debt repayments. Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities was $206.7 million, $552.4 million and $316.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and consists primarily of cash used for capital additions and business acquisitions for all the periods presented and cash provided by restricted marketable securities in 2004. Capital additions were $283.8 million, $273.2 million and $258.6 million during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. Cash used to acquire businesses, net of cash acquired, was $47.3 million, $51.5 million and $55.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The increase in restricted marketable securities during 2003 consists of amounts transferred from unrestricted cash for financial guarantees. In 2004, we liquidated a portion of these marketable securities and used the proceeds to repay the $225.0 million of public notes. We used letters of credit to replace financial guarantees secured by marketable securities that were liquidated. We intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand, cash flows from operations, our revolving credit facility, tax exempt bonds and other financings. We expect to use primarily cash for future business acquisitions. Cash Flows Used In Financing Activities. Cash flows used in financing activities was $437.3 million, $70.4 million and $128.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and primarily include proceeds from issuances of tax exempt bonds, repayments of debt and repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase program. Dividends paid were $46.0 million and $19.0 million during 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2004, repayments of debt include the liquidation of $225.0 million of public notes. From 2000 through 2004, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,025.0 million of our common stock. As of December 31, 2004, we paid $750.4 million to repurchase approximately 35.2 million shares of our common stock, of which $266.1 million was paid during 2004 to repurchase approximately 9.6 million shares of our common stock. 46 Table of Contents In December 1999, we entered into an operating lease facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles. In July 2002, we retired this facility using our excess cash. We used proceeds from our cash on hand, liquidation of marketable securities, cash flow from operations, and tax exempt bonds to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions and to repay debt. We intend to finance future stock repurchases and dividend payments through cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our revolving credit facility and other financings. Credit Rating Our company has received investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2004, our senior debt was rated BBB+/positive by Standard & Poors, BBB+/positive by Fitch and Baa2 by Moodys. Operating Lease Facility In December 1999, we entered into a $100.0 million facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles. In July 2002, we exercised our right to purchase the equipment underlying this facility by paying $72.6 million using our excess cash, which was the balance outstanding under the facility at that time. Fuel Hedge During June 2001, we entered into option agreements for approximately 14.3 million gallons of heating oil. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, the options qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases. These option agreements settled each month in equal notional amounts expiring in December 2002. The option agreements were structured as zero cost collars indexed to the price of heating oil. In accordance with SFAS 133, $1.6 million net of tax, representing the effective portion of the change in fair value has been recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income for the year ended December 31, 2002. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value of approximately $.1 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 has been included in other income, (expense) net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Realized losses of $.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2002 related to these option agreements are included in cost of operations in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2004 (in millions): Maturities of Notes Final Payable and Capping, Amounts Due Unconditional Operating Capital Long Term Closure and to Former Purchase Year Ending December 31, Leases Leases Debt Post Closure Remediation Owners Commitments Total 2005 $ 4.1 $ $ 2.4 $ 14.6 $ 2.7 $ 4.3 $ 27.6 $ 55.7 2006 3.1 2.2 58.1 2.5 9.9 75.8 2007 2.8 1.6 49.5 2.5 2.0 58.4 2008 1.6 1.2 20.1 2.5 1.4 26.8 2009 1.3 376.1 31.9 2.5 1.4 413.2 Thereafter 5.6 25.0 947.0 457.7 41.3 11.8 1,488.4 Total $ 18.5 $ 25.0 $ 1,330.5 $ 631.9 $ 54.0 $ 4.3 $ 54.1 $ 2,118.3 The estimated remaining final capping, closure and post closure expenditures presented above are undiscounted and include both payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of December 31, 2004 and estimated future liabilities expected to be incurred as the remaining landfill disposal capacities are consumed. 47 Table of Contents Unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of long term disposal agreements that require us to dispose of a minimum number of tons at third party facilities. We do not have or engage in any off balance sheet arrangements. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement. Our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates in the United States and fluctuations in LIBOR. We intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. All items described below are non trading. Expected Maturity Date Fair Value (Asset)/Liability December 31, 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total 2004 VARIABLE RATE DEBT: Amount outstanding (in millions) $ .6 $ .3 $ $ $ $ 228.2 $ 229.1 $ 229.1 Average interest rates 2.2 % 2.2 % 2.2 % 2.2 % INTEREST RATE SWAPS: Amount outstanding (in millions) $ $ $ $ $ $ 210.0 $ 210.0 $ (.5 ) Average interest rates % 2.3 % 2.3 % The fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable and, thus, approximate current market rates. Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Standards (GAAP), as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows. Our free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2004, 2003 and 2002 is calculated as follows (in millions): 2004 2003 2002 Cash provided by operating activities $ 666.3 $ 600.5 $ 569.7 Purchases of property and equipment (283.8 ) (273.2 ) (258.6 ) Proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 5.7 9.1 14.6 Free cash flow $ 388.2 $ 336.4 $ 325.7 We expect our free cash flow during 2005 to be lower than 2004 and 2003 because of higher tax payments due to the reversal of bonus depreciation, higher purchases of property and equipment and several one time items that benefited previous periods, including utilization of a tax receivable and the collection of a note receivable during 2004, and an increase in self insurance reserves during 2003. We believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment, net of proceeds from the sale of property and equipment. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided, pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment our existing business platform, repurchasing shares of common stock at prices that provide value to our shareholders, paying cash dividends, maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt. In addition, free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation. Free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or 48 Table of Contents that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Seasonality Our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding compensation), delay the collection and disposal of waste, reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites, or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities. New Accounting Pronouncements On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. SFAS 123(R) must be adopted by public companies no later than July 1, 2005. Early adoption will be permitted in periods in which financial statements have not been issued. We expect to adopt SFAS 123(R) on July 1, 2005. SFAS 123(R) permits public companies to adopt its requirements using one of two methods: 1. A modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date (a) based on the requirements of SFAS 123(R) for all share based payments granted after the effective date and (b) based on the requirements of SFAS 123 for all awards granted to employees prior to the effective date of SFAS 123(R) that remain unvested on the effective date. 2. A modified retrospective method which includes the requirements of the modified prospective method described above, but also permits entities to restate based on the amounts previously reflected in their SFAS 123 pro forma disclosures either (a) all prior periods presented or (b) prior interim periods of the year of adoption. The Company plans to adopt SFAS 123(R) using the modified prospective method. As permitted by SFAS 123, the company currently accounts for share based payments to employees using APB 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognizes no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 123(R)s fair value method may have a significant impact on our result of operations, although it will have no impact on our overall financial position. The impact of adoption of SFAS 123(R) cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on levels of share based payments granted in the future. SFAS 123(R) requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While the Company cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options), the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were $10.6 million, $6.7 million, and $4.0 million in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. 49 Table of Contents
