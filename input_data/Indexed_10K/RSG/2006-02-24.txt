ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and their Notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Overview of Our Business We are a leading provider of non hazardous solid waste collection and disposal services in the United States. We provide solid waste collection services for commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers through 140 collection companies in 21 states. We also own or operate 92 transfer stations, 59 solid waste landfills and 32 recycling facilities. We generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations. Our remaining revenue is from other services including landfill disposal, recycling, compost, mulch and soil operations. The following table reflects our revenue by source for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Collection: Residential $ 683.6 23.9 % $ 655.2 24.2 % $ 601.2 23.9 % Commercial 781.1 27.3 737.9 27.2 706.0 28.0 Industrial 597.8 20.9 558.1 20.6 523.0 20.8 Other 76.6 2.6 62.2 2.3 50.9 2.0 Total collection 2,139.1 74.7 2,013.4 74.3 1,881.1 74.7 Transfer and disposal 1,108.6 1,031.0 967.5 Less: Intercompany (560.1 ) (519.8 ) (493.7 ) Transfer and disposal, net 548.5 19.1 511.2 18.9 473.8 18.8 Other 176.3 6.2 183.5 6.8 162.9 6.5 Revenue $ 2,863.9 100.0 % $ 2,708.1 100.0 % $ 2,517.8 100.0 % Our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers. Our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on long term contracts with municipalities. We generally provide industrial and commercial collection services to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years. Our revenue from landfill operations is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties. In general, we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials. No one customer has individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years. The cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes disposal, labor, self insurance, fuel and equipment maintenance costs. We seek operating efficiencies by controlling the movement of waste from the point of collection through disposal. During the three months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, approximately 57% and 54%, respectively, of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate. Our landfill costs include daily operating expenses, costs of capital for cell development, costs for final capping, closure and post closure, and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance. Daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal, methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance, interim cap maintenance, and costs associated with the application of daily cover materials. We expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred. We use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to cell development. In life cycle accounting, certain direct costs are capitalized, and charged to expense based upon the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. These costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation, natural and 22 synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems, installation of groundwater monitoring wells, and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site. Obligations associated with final capping, closure and post closure are capitalized, and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed. Cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers. These estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to adjust our rates used to expense capitalized costs. Changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs, available airspace, inflation and applicable regulations. Changes in available airspace include changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted. Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the respective years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is shown in the following table: Depreciation, Amortization, Depletion and SFAS 143 Depreciation, Accretion Before Adjustments to Amortization, Operating Net SFAS 143 Amortization Depletion and Income Operating 2005 Revenue Adjustments Expense(a) Accretion (Loss) Margin Eastern Region $ 543.7 $ 45.3 $ (.7 ) $ 44.6 $ 92.2 17.0 % Central Region 567.8 81.3 .9 82.2 103.5 18.2 % Southern Region 734.7 74.0 (.4 ) 73.6 121.4 16.5 % Southwestern Region 320.8 33.5 (4.2 ) 29.3 50.9 15.9 % Western Region 693.9 58.8 .6 59.4 163.9 23.6 % Corporate Entities 3.0 4.2 4.2 (54.7 ) Total $ 2,863.9 $ 297.1 $ (3.8 ) $ 293.3 $ 477.2 16.7 % Depreciation, Amortization, Depletion and SFAS 143 Depreciation, Accretion Before Adjustments to Amortization, Operating Net SFAS 143 Amortization Depletion and Income Operating 2004 Revenue Adjustments Expense(a) Accretion (Loss) Margin Eastern Region $ 545.4 $ 43.2 $ .6 $ 43.8 $ 81.4 14.9 % Central Region 544.3 79.3 .1 79.4 102.6 18.8 % Southern Region 672.3 68.6 (1.9 ) 66.7 112.8 16.8 % Southwestern Region 309.1 31.1 (.5 ) 30.6 42.2 13.7 % Western Region 636.5 51.0 (2.7 ) 48.3 160.6 25.2 % Corporate Entities .5 4.3 4.3 (47.3 ) Total $ 2,708.1 $ 277.5 $ (4.4 ) $ 273.1 $ 452.3 16.7 % Depreciation, Amortization, Operating Net Depletion and Income Operating 2003 Revenue Accretion (Loss) Margin Eastern Region $ 507.2 $ 36.4 $ 65.3 12.9 % Central Region 520.1 74.0 99.9 19.2 % Southern Region 603.4 62.8 99.7 16.5 % Southwestern Region 301.4 28.7 46.5 15.4 % Western Region 585.5 46.2 140.4 24.0 % Corporate Entities .2 3.7 (39.1 ) Total $ 2,517.8 $ 251.8 $ 412.7 16.4 % (a) Consists of adjustments to amortization expense for changes in estimates and assumptions related to our annual review of landfill asset retirement obligations under SFAS 143. 23 Our operations are managed and reviewed through five regions that we designate as our reportable segments. From 2004 to 2005, operating income increased in all of our regions due to the successful execution of our pricing strategy. During the first quarter of 2005, we divested of our operations in western New York which reduced revenue in our Eastern Region. This reduction in revenue was almost completely offset by increases in prices. Operating margins improved because of increases in prices and lower average disposal costs resulting from the New York divestiture. In our Central Region, price increases and acquisitions resulted in higher revenue during 2005 compared to 2004. Operating margins decreased primarily due to higher fuel costs partially offset by lower subcontracting and third party hauling costs. Our operations in the Southern Region benefited from stronger volumes in our collection, transfer and landfill businesses. Operating margins decreased primarily due to higher fuel costs partially offset by decreases in labor and maintenance costs resulting from operating efficiencies. In our Southwestern Region, increased revenue resulting from increased prices and volumes was partially offset by a decrease in revenue at our remediation and heavy construction services business. This business was sold in the fourth quarter of 2005. Operating margins improved because of a decrease in subcontracting costs and due to adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with SFAS 143. In our Western Region, increases in prices and volumes in our collection, transfer and landfill operations resulted in higher revenue during 2005 compared to 2004. Operating margins decreased because of higher fuel and disposal costs and because of adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with SFAS 143. The increase in operating loss for Corporate Entities from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to higher compensation and other costs related to the expansion of our business, approximately $3.0 million of costs associated with the exchange of unsecured notes during 2005 and $2.1 million related to the acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding stock options in 2005. The increase in operating income from 2003 to 2004 in total and for each of our regions was partially due to a decrease in self insurance expense. Operating income increased in our Eastern, Southern and Western Regions due to an overall increase in revenue resulting from the successful execution of our growth strategy. In the Central Region, increased revenue was partially offset by weak economic conditions and an increase in costs related to the long haul transport of waste by third party vendors. In the Southwestern Region, revenue growth was impeded by the closure of a landfill and the completion of a special waste contract during 2003. The increase in costs for Corporate Entities from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to the expansion of our business. 2005 Financial Objectives In January 2005, we publicly announced our objectives for the year. These objectives included the following: Generating free cash flow (a non GAAP measure) of approximately of $260 million. Using our free cash flow to repurchase shares of our common stock under our $275.0 million share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in October 2004 and continuing to pay quarterly cash dividends. Generating diluted earnings per share of $1.65 to $1.70. Growing revenue from core operations in the range of 4.0% to 4.5%, with 2.5% attributable to price increases and 1.5% to 2.0% attributable to volume growth. Purchasing approximately $300 million of property and equipment. 2005 Business Performance During 2005, we exceeded all of our financial objectives. 24 Our internal growth from core operations for 2005 was 6.1%, with 3.8% from price increases and 2.3% from volume growth. During 2005, our revenue growth from core pricing benefited from a broad based pricing initiative which we started during the fourth quarter of 2003. We also secured broad based price increases to offset various escalating capital and operating costs, including fuel. We experienced core volume growth in all lines of our business, including our residential collection business resulting from the addition of several new municipal contracts, and our landfill and transfer station businesses resulting from newly opened sites and new contracts. Our core volume growth was also positively impacted by hurricane clean up efforts. In addition, our geographic mix of business, which is concentrated in high growth markets, positively impacted our operating results. As a result, during 2005 we were able to exceed the internal growth objectives we established at the beginning of the year. Our operating margins in 2005 remained consistent with those achieved during 2004. During 2005, significantly higher fuel costs were offset by improved pricing, lower self insurance expense and continued focus on productivity improvements. During 2005, we generated free cash flow of $448.9 million (consisting of cash provided by operating activities of $767.5 million, less purchases of property and equipment of $328.7 million, plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment of $10.1 million), which substantially exceeded our objective. Our free cash flow was positively impacted by a $113.4 million federal tax payment that was deferred until February 2006 as a result of an Internal Revenue Service notice issued in response to Hurricane Katrina, and the timing of payments for capital and other expenditures. During 2005, we used our free cash flow to repurchase 16.3 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 11% of our outstanding shares, for $558.4 million. Also, during the third quarter of 2005, our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend to $.14 per share. During 2005, we generated diluted earnings per share of $1.75 which significantly exceeded our objective. 2006 Financial Objectives Our financial objectives for 2006 assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of 2005. Specific guidance is as follows: We expect to generate normalized free cash flow in excess of 100% of net income, or approximately $270 million to $280 million. Normalized free cash flow excludes $113.4 million of federal tax payments and approximately $60 million of payments for capital and other expenditures that relate to 2005 that will be made during 2006. We anticipate using our free cash flow to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock under our existing $216.2 million share repurchase program and our $275.0 million share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in January 2006. We also anticipate using our free cash flow to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends. We anticipate diluted earnings per share of $1.90 to $1.93. We are targeting internal growth from core operations to be approximately 5.0%, with 3.5% attributable to price increases and 1.5% attributable to volume growth. We anticipate purchasing approximately $315 million of property and equipment, net of sales of property and equipment. 2006 Business Initiatives Our business initiatives for 2006 are generally a continuation of those initiated in prior years and are dependent on further standardizing our business processes and improving our systems. Ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and processes and are trained on our systems is essential to the overall success of our initiatives. Our business initiatives for 2006 are as follows: Pricing initiatives. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we implemented a broad based pricing initiative across all lines of our business. The purpose of this initiative is to recover increasing costs and improve 25 operating margins. We realized the benefit of this initiative during 2004 and 2005 and expect a continuing benefit during 2006. Improve Business Integration. During 2005 we took a number of steps to further strengthen our business platform and improve our business integration. In response to limited vertical integration opportunities, we divested of our operations in western New York. We acquired a landfill in the Dallas/Fort Worth area which better integrated that marketplace. In addition, we divested of our remediation and heavy construction services business because it did not compliment our core business strategy. We plan to continue to develop and implement strategies that improve the performance of locations and lines of business that are performing below the companys average. To achieve this objective, we may purchase operations from or exchange operations with other solid waste companies in the future. Improve the quality of our revenue. The first step in this process was completed in 2001 and included installing a standardized billing and operating system. This system enables us to, among other things, stratify our customers to determine how our rates compare to current market pricing. During 2002, we implemented the second generation of this software which we call RSI 1.0. RSI 1.0, our companys core business system, provides a variety of functionalities including customer service, dispatch, billing, sales analysis, account retention and route productivity analysis. During 2006, we will complete the development of the next generation of our billing and operating system. This system will provide additional functionality to our operating locations and further standardize our billing and operating processes. We currently monitor our return on investment by marketplace and have instituted a return on investment pricing model. This model will eventually allow us to track our return on investment by customer. During 2001, we also implemented a customer relationship management system. This system improves the productivity of our sales force by helping to establish marketing priorities and track sales leads. It also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial, industrial and franchise contracts. During 2006, we will continue to ensure our sales force is properly trained on this system and is using it as intended. Improve the productivity of our operations. We use a grid productivity program that enables us to benchmark the performance of our drivers. In addition, in our larger markets, we use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and improve operational density. During 2006, we will continue to update our disposal optimization metrics. These metrics identify which local disposal option maximizes our return on invested capital and cash flow. Improve fleet management and procurement. In February 2002, we selected Dossier as our fleet management and parts procurement system. During 2003, we implemented Dossier at all of our significant hauling and landfill operations. Among other features, this system tracks parts inventories, generates automatic quantity order points and logs all maintenance work. It allows us to capture and review information to ensure our preventive maintenance programs comply with manufacturers warranties and governmental regulations. In addition, the purchase order module within this system allows us to cross reference purchasing information with our inventory. During 2006, we intend to further utilize this purchase order module to take advantage of volume discounts. Enhance operational and financial reporting systems. We have several initiatives aimed at improving our operational and financial reporting systems. The overall goal of these initiatives is to provide us with detailed information, prepared in a consistent manner that will allow us to quickly analyze and act upon trends in our business. One of our most significant systems is our enterprise wide general ledger package. We successfully converted all of our locations to Lawson general ledger software in 2002 and in 2003 successfully converted all of our locations to Lawson fixed asset software. All of the system initiatives mentioned above will provide us with more consistent and detailed information, thus allowing us to make quicker and more informed business decisions. In addition, during 2001, all of our significant software applications were standardized and centralized at our data center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This standardization and centralization provides us with consolidated information concerning our 26 operations across a variety of operational and financial disciplines. It also significantly enhances our ability to execute our disaster recovery plan. During 2006 we will begin to develop an enterprise wide human resource information system. This system will provide a number of direct benefits including a reduction in payroll processing and compliance costs and integration into our general ledger software. It will also provide a number of indirect benefits including better information concerning labor and related costs and better control over employee related initiatives such as training. We expect to implement this new system in 2007. Expand our safety training programs. As part of our ongoing emphasis on safe work practices and in light of increasing insurance costs, we expanded our safety training programs in 2002. During 2004, we distributed to all of our locations a comprehensive training and safety manual. Safety will continue to be a key area of focus during 2006. 27 Critical Accounting Policies and Disclosures Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management. The following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain: Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Landfill Accounting: Life Cycle Accounting We use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain landfill costs over the life of the site. In life cycle accounting, all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized, and charged to expense based upon the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. Obligations associated with final capping, closure and post closure are capitalized, and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed. Cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers. Changes in these estimates could significantly affect our amortization, depletion, and accretion expense. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Landfill and Environmental Matters. Note 3, Accrued Landfill and Environmental Costs in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Probable Expansion Airspace We include in our calculation of total available airspace expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood that the expansion area will ultimately be permitted. We have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace. We believe that satisfying each of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted. However, because some of these criteria are judgmental, they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted. In either of these scenarios, our amortization, depletion and accretion expense could change significantly. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Landfill and Environmental Matters. Note 3, Accrued Landfill and Environmental Costs in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 28 Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Final Capping, Closure and Post Closure Prior to January 1, 2003, costs for final closure of our landfills and costs for providing required post closure monitoring and maintenance were charged to cost of operations based upon consumed airspace using the units of consumption method. These costs were not inflated or discounted to the present value of total estimated costs. On January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Under SFAS 143, obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event. Obligations related to closure and post closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire landfill life. Landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units of consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed throughout the entire landfill, depending upon the nature of the obligation. All obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value. Fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and the companys credit adjusted, risk free rate. Total future costs for final capping, closure and post closure are developed at least annually by engineers. Changes in these estimates could affect our amortization of final capping, closure and post closure costs and our accretion expense. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Landfill and Environmental Matters and Selected Balance Sheet Accounts. Note 3, Accrued Landfill and Environmental Costs in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 29 Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Self Insurance: Our insurance programs for workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured. Self insurance accruals are based on claims reported and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported. Estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported are developed actuarially. If actual claims experience or development is significantly different than our estimates, our self insurance expense would change. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Selected Balance Sheet Accounts. Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Property and Equipment: Expenditures for Improvements, Repairs and Maintenance Expenditures for major additions and improvements to facilities are capitalized. All expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred. Whether certain expenditures improve an asset or lengthen its useful life is subject to our judgment. Accordingly, the actual useful lives of our assets could differ from our estimates. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Property and Equipment. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Useful Lives Property and equipment are recorded at cost. Depreciation and amortization expense are provided over the estimated useful lives of the applicable assets using the straight line method. The estimated useful lives are seven to forty years for buildings and improvements, five to twelve years for vehicles, seven to ten years for most landfill equipment, three to fifteen years for all other equipment, and five to twelve years for furniture and fixtures. Our estimates regarding the useful lives of our depreciable assets are based on our judgment. Accordingly, actual useful lives could differ from our estimates. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Property and Equipment. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 30 Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Capitalized Interest We capitalize interest on landfill cell construction and other construction projects in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 34, Capitalization of Interest Cost. Capitalizing too little or too much interest expense could lead to a misstatement of interest expense in the consolidated statement of income. In order to minimize this risk, construction projects must meet the following criteria before interest is capitalized: 1. Total construction costs are $50,000 or greater, 2. the construction phase is one month or longer, and 3. the assets have a useful life of one year or longer. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Property and Equipment. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Revenue and Accounts Receivable: Revenue consists primarily of collection fees from various customer types and transfer and landfill disposal fees charged to third parties. Advance billings are recorded as deferred revenue. Revenue is recognized over the period in which services are provided. No one customer has individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the past three years. Reserves for accounts receivable are provided when a receivable is believed to be uncollectible or generally when a receivable is in excess of 90 days old. Establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our accounts receivable reserve is a matter of judgment. If our judgment and estimates concerning the adequacy of our reserve for accounts receivable is incorrect, bad debt expense would change.

Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 31 Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Derivatives: From time to time, we use derivatives to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and diesel fuel prices. These derivatives have been accounted for in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. The hedging relationships we have entered into are expected to be either 100% effective or highly effective and have been determined to meet the criteria for hedge accounting. If, in the future, these relationships are no longer expected to be 100% or highly effective, or if they no longer meet the criteria for hedge accounting, our results of operations could change. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Financial Condition and Fuel Hedge. Note 5, Debt, and Note 11, Other Comprehensive Income in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 32 Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Long Lived Asset Impairments: Long lived assets consist primarily of property, equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets. We periodically evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred (as further described in Note 2 of the Consolidated Financial Statements) that may warrant revision of the estimated useful life of long lived assets or whether the remaining balance of these assets should be evaluated for possible impairment. We use an estimate of the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining life of the assets in assessing their recoverability. In addition, goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. In testing for goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of each operating segment of our business and compare the fair values with the carrying values. When the fair value of an operating segment is greater than its carrying value, no impairment results. We measure impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or operating segment exceeds its fair value. Our estimates of future cash flows and fair values are based on our judgment. Accordingly, we could designate certain assets as impaired that are not and fail to identify certain impaired assets. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Property and Equipment. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 4, Business Combinations, in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 33 Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Income Taxes: We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Accordingly, deferred taxes have been provided to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. After the initial recognition of a deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance is provided if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and the realizability of net operating losses for tax purposes are based upon our judgment. If our judgment and estimates concerning valuation allowances and the realizability of net operating losses are incorrect, our provision for income taxes would change. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 6, Income Taxes, in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Combinations We make decisions to acquire or invest in businesses based on financial and strategic considerations. Businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. We acquired various solid waste businesses during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. The aggregate purchase prices we paid for these transactions was $26.7 million, $47.4 million and $51.5 million, respectively. In addition, during 2005, we entered into a $53.9 million capital lease related to a landfill. We divested of our operations in western New York during the three months ended March 31, 2005 and received proceeds of $29.1 million. A gain of $3.3 million was recorded on the divestiture. In addition, during the three months ended December 31, 2005, we sold our environmental remediation company and received proceeds of $1.2 million. A loss of $2.0 million was recorded on the divestiture. Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) for 2005 acquisitions totaled $16.6 million. As of December 31, 2005 we had goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,563.8 million. During 2005, $57.9 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions (including debt acquired) and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace. As of December 31, 2005, we had $800.7 million of landfill development costs, net of accumulated depletion and amortization, which includes purchase price allocated to landfill airspace as well as other capitalized landfill costs. When a landfill is acquired as part of a group of assets, purchase price is allocated to airspace based upon the discounted expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within the acquired group and is adjusted for other landfill assets and liabilities acquired (which are primarily for final capping, closure and post closure obligations). Landfill purchase 34 price is amortized using the units of consumption method over total available airspace, which includes probable expansion airspace where appropriate. Goodwill for 2004 acquisitions totaled approximately $13.2 million. As of December 31, 2004, we had goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,562.7 million. $28.2 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace. Goodwill for 2003 acquisitions totaled approximately $21.2 million. As of December 31, 2003, we had goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,558.1 million. $27.7 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace. Consolidated Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 Our income before cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles was $253.7 million for the year ended December 31, 2005, as compared to $237.9 million in 2004 and $215.4 million in 2003. Net income was $253.7 million for year ended December 31, 2005, or $1.75 per diluted share, as compared to $237.9 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, in 2004 and $177.6 million, or $1.10 per diluted share, in 2003. Net income for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes an after tax expense of $37.8 million (net of an income tax benefit of $23.1 million), or $.23 per share, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, and a change in accounting principle for our methane gas collection systems. See Note 1, Basis of Presentation, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of these changes in accounting principles. The following table summarizes our costs and expenses in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue for 2005, 2004 and 2003: 2005 2004 2003 Revenue $ 2,863.9 100.0 % $ 2,708.1 100.0 % $ 2,517.8 100.0 % Cost of operations 1,803.9 63.0 1,714.4 63.3 1,605.4 63.8 Depreciation, amortization and depletion of property and equipment 271.7 9.5 252.4 9.3 233.8 9.3 Amortization of intangible assets 7.1 .2 7.0 .3 5.3 .2 Accretion 14.5 .5 13.7 .5 12.7 .5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 289.5 10.1 268.3 9.9 247.9 9.8 Operating income $ 477.2 16.7 % $ 452.3 16.7 % $ 412.7 16.4 % 35 Revenue. Revenue was $2,863.9 million, $2,708.1 million and $2,517.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Revenue increased by $155.8 million, or 5.8%, from 2004 to 2005. Revenue increased by $190.3 million, or 7.6%, from 2003 to 2004. The following table reflects the components of our revenue growth for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003: 2005 2004 2003 Core price 2.7 % 2.3 % 1.8 % Fuel surcharges .8 .2 .2 Environmental fees .2 Recycling commodities .1 .5 .1 Total price 3.8 3.0 2.1 Core volume 2.5 3.6 2.1 Non core volume (.2 ) .1 Total volume 2.3 3.7 2.1 Total internal growth 6.1 6.7 4.2 Acquisitions, net of divestitures (.4 ) .9 1.8 Taxes(a) .1 .5 Total revenue growth 5.8 % 7.6 % 6.5 % (a) Represents new taxes levied on landfill volumes in certain states that are passed on to customers. 2005: During the year ended December 31, 2005, our revenue growth from core pricing continued to benefit from a broad based pricing initiative which we started during the fourth quarter of 2003. We anticipate that we will continue to realize this benefit throughout 2006. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we experienced core volume growth in our residential collection, industrial collection and landfill businesses. Our core volume growth was also positively impacted by hurricane clean up efforts. In June 2005, we began assessing environmental fees on the non franchise portion of our customer base. 2004: During the year ended December 31, 2004, our revenue growth from core pricing benefited from a broad based pricing initiative which we started during the fourth quarter of 2003. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we experienced core volume growth in all lines of our business, including our residential collection business resulting from the addition of several new municipal contracts, and our landfill and transfer station businesses resulting from newly opened sites and new contracts. 2003: During the first three quarters of 2003, we experienced moderate growth in revenue due to an increase in core pricing. During the fourth quarter of 2003, our revenue growth from core pricing increased at a more rapid pace due to our broad based pricing initiative. During 2003, the economic slowdown which began during 2001 continued to negatively impact our business. However, during 2003, our revenue growth from core volume continued to be positively impacted by long term franchise and municipal contracts that were secured during 2002. 2006 Outlook: We anticipate internal growth from core operations to be approximately 5.0% during 2006 assuming no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of 2005. However, our price and volume growth may remain flat or may decline in 2006 depending upon economic conditions and our success in implementing pricing initiatives. Cost of Operations. Cost of operations was $1,803.9 million, $1,714.4 million and $1,605.4 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 63.0%, 63.3% and 63.8%, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in aggregate dollars in all periods presented is primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through internal growth. 36 The following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Subcontractor, disposal and third party fees $ 694.9 24.3 % $ 667.8 24.7 % $ 611.3 24.3 % Labor and benefits 557.3 19.5 536.2 19.8 493.4 19.6 Maintenance and operating 401.2 14.0 355.5 13.1 314.0 12.5 Insurance and other 150.5 5.2 154.9 5.7 186.7 7.4 Total $ 1,803.9 63.0 % $ 1,714.4 63.3 % $ 1,605.4 63.8 % A description of our cost categories is as follows: Subcontractor, disposal and third party fees include costs such as third party disposal, transportation of waste, host fees and cost of goods sold. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to improved pricing, a change in mix of revenue and continued focus on productivity improvements partially offset by higher fuel related subcontracting costs. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to an increase in the cost of long haul transport of waste by third party vendors. Labor and benefits include costs such as wages, salaries, payroll taxes and health benefits for our frontline service employees and their supervisors. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to improved pricing, a change in revenue mix and continued focus on productivity improvements during the years presented. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to health insurance. Maintenance and operating includes costs such as fuel, parts, shop labor and benefits, third party repairs, and landfill monitoring and operating. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the years presented is primarily due to an increase in fuel costs. The cost of fuel as a percentage of revenue increased by approximately 1.0% from 2004 to 2005 and .7% from 2003 to 2004. Insurance and other includes costs such as workers compensation, auto and general liability insurance, property taxes, property maintenance, and utilities. The decrease in such costs as a percentage of revenue for the years presented is primarily due to a decrease in risk insurance expense. Risk insurance expense as a percentage of revenue decreased by .5% from 2004 to 2005 and 1.4% from 2003 to 2004. The cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies. As such, care should be taken when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to those of other companies. Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion of Property and Equipment. Depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were $271.7 million, $252.4 million and $233.8 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 9.5%, 9.3% and 9.3%, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in aggregate dollars for the periods presented is primarily due to the expansion of our operations through internal growth and acquisitions. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2005 versus the comparable 2004 period is due to an increase in depreciation expense associated with vehicles and equipment acquired in 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Intangible assets consist primarily of costs in excess of fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill), but also includes values assigned to long term contracts, covenants not to compete and customer relationships. Expenses for amortization of intangible assets were $7.1 million, $7.0 million and $5.3 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, .2%, .3% and .2%, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to amortization expense on amounts that were recorded in other intangible assets during the three months ended September 30, 2004 resulting from an extensive internal review of all recent acquisitions. The 37 increase in amortization of intangible assets in aggregate dollars is also due to the amortization of intangible assets associated with businesses acquired during 2004. Accretion Expense. Accretion expense was $14.5 million, $13.7 million and $12.7 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, .5% for each of the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005. The increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars in 2005 and 2004 is primarily due to expansion of our landfill operations. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $289.5 million, $268.3 million and $247.9 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 10.1%, 9.9% and 9.8%, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increases in aggregate dollars are primarily a result of the expansion of our business. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2005 versus the comparable 2004 period is primarily due to approximately $3.0 million of costs incurred during the first quarter of 2005 associated with the exchange of unsecured notes. It is also due to a $2.1 million non cash charge incurred during the fourth quarter of 2005 related to the acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding stock options previously awarded to employees. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from 2003 to 2004 is primarily due to higher compensation costs. We believe that selling, general and administrative expenses in the range of 10% of revenue are appropriate for 2006 given our business platform. Operating Income. Operating income was $477.2 million, $452.3 million and $412.7 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 16.7%, 16.7% and 16.4%, for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest Expense. We incurred interest expense primarily on our unsecured notes and tax exempt bonds. Interest expense was $81.0 million, $76.7 million and $78.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in interest expense from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to an increase in interest rates on our floating rate debt, an increase in debt balances, and fees associated with the refinancing of our revolving credit facility in 2005. In May 2004, $225.0 million of our public notes matured and were repaid resulting in a reduction in interest expense, which was partially offset by increases in interest expense resulting from additional tax exempt financing obtained during 2004. Capitalized interest was $2.0 million, $2.1 million and $3.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Interest Income and Other Income (Expense), Net. Interest income and other income, net of other expense, was $13.0 million, $8.1 million and $12.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The variances during the periods are primarily due to fluctuations in cash, restricted cash and marketable securities balances and net gains on the disposition of assets during 2003. The increase in aggregate dollars during the year ended December 31, 2005 versus the comparable period last year is primarily due to an increase in interest income on cash and restricted cash balances resulting from higher interest rates. In May 2004, we used a portion of our outstanding cash and restricted cash and marketable securities balances to repay $225.0 million of public notes. Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes was $155.5 million, $145.8 million and $132.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our effective income tax rate was 38.0% for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Cumulative Effect of Changes in Accounting Principles. During the first quarter of 2003, we adopted SFAS 143. SFAS 143 required us to change the methodology we used to record final capping, closure and post closure costs related to our landfills. As of January 1, 2003, we recorded an after tax expense of $20.8 million, or $33.6 million on a pre tax basis, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulting from the adoption of SFAS 143. In addition, we also recorded an after tax expense of $17.0 million, or $27.4 million on a pre tax basis, as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for our methane gas collection systems. This change in accounting principle for methane gas collection systems was prompted by a thorough evaluation of our landfill accounting policy in connection with the adoption of SFAS 143 and is consistent with the methodology used by other participants in the waste industry. 38 Landfill and Environmental Matters Available Airspace The following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005: Landfills Balance as of New Acquired or Permits Changes in Changes Balance as of December 31, Expansions Divested, Granted, Net Airspace Engineering in December 31, 2002 Undertaken Net of Closures Consumed Estimates Design 2003 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,357.9 26.3 154.6 (39.3 ) (.9 ) 1,498.6 Number of sites 56 2 58 Probable expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 353.3 61.6 (154.1 ) (3.5 ) 11.4 268.7 Number of sites 20 (5 ) 15 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,711.2 61.6 26.3 .5 (39.3 ) (4.4 ) 11.4 1,767.3 Number of sites 56 2 58 Landfills Balance as of Acquired or Permits Changes in Changes Balance as of December 31, Divested, Granted, Net Airspace Engineering in December 31, 2003 Net of Closures Consumed Estimates Design 2004 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,498.6 24.4 48.6 (42.1 ) .1 1,529.6 Number of sites 58 1 (1 ) 58 Probable expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 268.7 (48.6 ) .1 2.0 222.2 Number of sites 15 (3 ) 12 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,767.3 24.4 (42.1 ) .2 2.0 1,751.8 Number of sites 58 1 (1 ) 58 Landfills Balance as of New Acquired or Permits Changes in Changes Balance as of December 31, Expansions Divested, Granted, Net Airspace Engineering in December 31, 2004 Undertaken Net of Closures Consumed Estimates Design 2005 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,529.6 17.9 64.8 (43.6 ) 7.4 1.6 1,577.7 Number of sites 58 1 59 Probable expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 222.2 8.3 (52.7 ) (.3 ) .2 177.7 Number of sites 12 1 (4 ) 9 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,751.8 8.3 17.9 12.1 (43.6 ) 7.1 1.8 1,755.4 Number of sites 58 1 59 Changes in engineering estimates typically include minor modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information. Changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfills footprint or vertical slopes. At December 31, 2002, 20.7% of our total available airspace, or 353.3 million cubic yards, consists of probable expansion airspace at twenty of our landfills. At December 31, 2005, 10.1% of our total available airspace, or 177.7 million cubic yards, consists of probable expansion airspace at nine of our landfills. This decrease in probable expansion airspace demonstrates our continued success in obtaining permits for expansion airspace. During 2003, total available airspace increased by 56.1 million cubic yards due to new expansions undertaken, two landfills that were acquired during the year, and changes in design partially offset by airspace consumption and changes in engineering estimates. During 2004, total available airspace decreased by 15.5 million cubic yards primarily due to airspace consumption partially offset by the acquisition of a landfill. During 2005, total available 39 airspace increased by 3.6 million cubic yards primarily due to new expansions undertaken, the acquisition of a landfill, permits granted and changes in engineering estimates partially offset by airspace consumed. As of December 31, 2005, we owned or operated 59 solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 1.8 billion in place cubic yards. Total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace. These estimates are developed at least annually by engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys. As of December 31, 2005, total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 1.6 billion in place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus .2 billion in place cubic yards of probable expansion airspace. Before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and, therefore, included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity, it must meet our expansion criteria. See Note 3, Accrued Landfill and Environmental Costs, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2005, nine of our landfills meet the criteria for including probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity. At projected annual volumes, these nine landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 34 years, including probable expansion airspace. The average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 30 years. The following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of December 31, 2005: Number of Sites without Number of Sites with Total Percent Expansion Airspace Expansion Airspace Sites of Total 0 to 5 years 6 6 10.0 % 6 to 10 years 6 6 10.0 11 to 20 years 16 2 18 30.5 21 to 40 years 14 4 18 30.5 41+ years 8 3 11 19.0 Total 50 9 59 100.0 % Sites with expansion airspace includes one landfill with less than five years of remaining permitted airspace. Final Capping, Closure and Post Closure Costs As of January 1, 2003, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. This statement required us to change the methodology we used to record final capping, closure and post closure costs. See Note 3, Accrued Landfill and Environmental Costs, of the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2005, accrued final capping, closure and post closure costs were $239.5 million. The current portion of these costs of $27.0 million is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in other current liabilities. The long term portion of these costs of $212.5 million is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs. 40 Investment in Landfills The following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 and the future expected investment as of December 31, 2005 (in millions): Cumulative Non Cash Effect of Additions Transfers Balance as of Changes in for Asset Additions and Balance as of December 31, Accounting Capital Landfill Retirement Charged to Other December 31, 2002 Principles Additions Acquisitions Obligations Expense Adjustments 2003 Non depletable landfill land $ 54.0 $ $ .1 $ .5 $ $ $ (5.1 ) $ 49.5 Landfill development costs 1,026.3 188.6 3.7 28.9 17.9 69.8 1,335.2 Construction in progress landfill 32.3 78.7 (50.2 ) 60.8 Accumulated depletion and amortization (304.1 ) (248.4 ) (92.8 ) .7 (644.6 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 808.5 $ (59.8 ) $ 82.5 $ 29.4 $ 17.9 $ (92.8 ) $ 15.2 $ 800.9 Non Cash Additions Transfers Balance as of for Asset SFAS 143 Additions and Balance as of December 31, Capital Retire Landfill Retirement Annual Charged to Other December 31, 2003 Additions ments Acquisitions Obligations Adjustments Expense Adjustments 2004 Non depletable landfill land $ 49.5 $ 1.0 $ $ 1.5 $ $ $ $ 1.4 $ 53.4 Landfill development costs 1,335.2 6.6 (1.9 ) 28.9 19.6 (4.3 ) 102.4 1,486.5 Construction in progress landfill 60.8 78.9 (100.6 ) 39.1 Accumulated depletion and amortization (644.6 ) 1.9 (1.0 ) (98.4 ) (.8 ) (742.9 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 800.9 $ 86.5 $ $ 29.4 $ 19.6 $ (4.3 ) $ (98.4 ) $ 2.4 $ 836.1 Non Cash Additions Transfers Balance as of for Asset SFAS 143 Additions and Balance as of December 31, Capital Retire Landfill Retirement Annual Charged to Other December 31, 2004 Additions ments Acquisitions Obligations Adjustments Expense Adjustments 2005 Non depletable landfill land $ 53.4 $ .4 $ $ $ $ $ $ (2.2 ) $ 51.6 Landfill development costs 1,486.5 24.3 (5.5 ) 59.7 20.4 (28.7 ) 73.3 1,630.0 Construction in progress landfill 39.1 83.7 (67.0 ) 55.8 Accumulated depletion and amortization (742.9 ) (2.8 ) 20.6 (104.2 ) (829.3 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 836.1 $ 108.4 $ (5.5 ) $ 56.9 $ 20.4 $ (8.1 ) $ (104.2 ) $ 4.1 $ 908.1 Balance as of Expected Total December 31, Future Expected 2005 Investment Investment Non depletable landfill land $ 51.6 $ $ 51.6 Landfill development costs 1,630.0 1,494.8 3,124.8 Construction in progress landfill 55.8 55.8 Accumulated depletion and amortization (829.3 ) (829.3 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 908.1 $ 1,494.8 $ 2,402.9 41 The following table reflects our net investment in our landfills, excluding non depletable land, and our depletion, amortization and accretion expense for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003: Years Ended December 31, 2005 2004 2003 Number of landfills owned or operated 59 58 58 Net investment, excluding non depletable land (in millions) $ 856.5 $ 782.7 $ 751.4 Total estimated available disposal capacity (in millions of cubic yards) 1,755.4 1,751.8 1,767.3 Net investment per cubic yard $ .49 $ .45 $ .43 Landfill depletion and amortization expense (in millions) $ 104.2 $ 98.4 $ 92.8 Accretion expense (in millions) 14.5 13.7 12.7 118.7 112.1 105.5 Airspace consumed (in millions of cubic yards) 43.6 42.1 39.3 Depletion, amortization and accretion expense per cubic yard of airspace consumed $ 2.72 $ 2.66 $ 2.68 During the twelve months ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, our weighted average compaction rate was approximately 1,500 pounds per cubic yard. As of December 31, 2005, we expect to spend an estimated additional $1,494.8 million on existing landfills, primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures, over their expected remaining lives. Our total expected investment, excluding non depletable land, estimated to be $2.4 billion, or $1.34 per cubic yard, is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based upon airspace consumed using the units of consumption method. We accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated. We accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities associated with properties acquired through business combinations as a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace, as appropriate. No material amounts were charged to expense during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003. Financial Condition At December 31, 2005 we had $131.8 million of cash and cash equivalents. We also had $255.3 million of restricted cash deposits, including $144.9 million of restricted cash held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities and $25.3 million pledged to various regulatory agencies and governmental entities as financial guarantees of our performance related to final capping, closure and post closure obligations at our landfills. In June 2005, we entered into a new $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks which expires in 2010. This facility replaced our prior facilities which aggregated $750.0 million. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at LIBOR based rates. We use our operating cash flow and proceeds from our credit facilities to finance our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and other requirements. At December 31, 2005, letters of credit outstanding totaling $391.2 million were secured by our revolving credit facility. As a result, as of December 31, 2005 we had $358.8 million available under our credit facility. In May 1999, we sold $600.0 million of unsecured notes in the public market. $225.0 million of these notes bore interest at 6.625% per annum and matured in May 2004. The remaining $375.0 million bear interest at 7.125% per annum and mature in 2009. Interest on these notes is payable semi annually in May and November. The $225.0 million and $375.0 million in notes were offered at a discount of $1.0 million and $.5 million, respectively. In March 2005, we exchanged $275.7 million of our outstanding 7.125% notes due 2009 for new notes due 2035. The new notes bear interest at 6.086%. We paid a premium of $27.6 million related to the exchange. This premium will be amortized over the life of the new notes using the effective yield method. 42 In August 2001, we sold $450.0 million of unsecured notes in the public market. The notes bear interest at 6.75% and mature in 2011. Interest on these notes is payable semi annually in February and August. The notes were offered at a discount of $2.6 million. Proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility. In March 2005, we entered into a $53.9 million capital lease related to a landfill. In order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates and to take advantage of favorable floating interest rates, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment grade rated financial institutions. The swap agreements have total notional values of $225.0 million and $210.0 million, respectively, and require our company to pay interest at floating rates based upon changes in LIBOR and receive interest at fixed rates of 6.625% and 6.75%, respectively. Swap agreements with a notional value of $225.0 million matured in May 2004, and agreements with a notional value of $210.0 million mature in August 2011. At December 31, 2005, we had $645.4 million of tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings outstanding of which approximately $119.5 million were obtained during fiscal 2005. Borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on fixed or floating interest rates at the prevailing market ranging from 3.25% to 5.63% at December 31, 2005 and have maturities ranging from 2006 to 2037. As of December 31, 2005, we had $144.9 million of restricted cash related to proceeds from tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings. This restricted cash will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements. We believe that our excess cash, cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facility provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due. We believe that we will be able to raise additional debt or equity financing, if necessary. Selected Balance Sheet Accounts The following tables reflect the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts, final capping, closure, post closure and remediation liabilities and accrued self insurance during the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 (in millions): Final Capping, Allowance for Closure and Doubtful Accounts Post Closure Remediation Self Insurance Balance, December 31, 2002 $ 19.0 $ 196.9 $ 58.9 $ 75.0 Cumulative effect of change in accounting principle (14.5 ) Non cash asset additions 17.9 Accretion expense 12.7 Other additions charged to expense 10.4 189.5 Payments or usage (10.4 ) (8.3 ) (4.2 ) (142.3 ) Balance, December 31, 2003 19.0 204.7 54.7 122.2 Less: Current portion (19.0 ) (29.5 ) (4.4 ) (47.6 ) Long term portion $ $ 175.2 $ 50.3 $ 74.6 43 Final Capping, Allowance for Closure and Doubtful Accounts Post Closure Remediation Self Insurance Balance, December 31, 2003 $ 19.0 $ 204.7 $ 54.7 $ 122.2 Non cash asset additions 19.6 Revisions in estimates of future cash flows recorded as non cash asset additions (4.3 ) Accretion expense 13.7 Other additions charged to expense 8.0 1.7 165.3 Acquisitions .6 Payments or usage (9.0 ) (17.5 ) (2.4 ) (143.7 ) Balance, December 31, 2004 18.0 216.8 54.0 143.8 Less: Current portion (18.0 ) (14.6 ) (2.7 ) (47.4 ) Long term portion $ $ 202.2 $ 51.3 $ 96.4 Final Capping, Allowance for Closure and Doubtful Accounts Post Closure Remediation Self Insurance Balance, December 31, 2004 $ 18.0 $ 216.8 $ 54.0 $ 143.8 Non cash asset additions 20.4 Revisions in estimates of future cash flows recorded as non cash asset additions (8.1 ) Accretion expense 14.5 Other additions charged to expense 6.5 .1 160.8 Acquisitions, net of divestitures .1 3.3 Payments or usage (7.3 ) (7.4 ) (3.8 ) (146.0 ) Balance, December 31, 2005 17.3 239.5 50.3 158.6 Less: Current portion 17.3 (27.0 ) (3.1 ) (57.5 ) Long term portion $ $ 212.5 $ 47.2 $ 101.1 Our expense related to doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue for 2003, 2004 and 2005 was .4%, .3% and .2%, respectively. As of December 31, 2005, accounts receivable were $280.0 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $17.3 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of 34 or 22 days net of deferred revenue. In addition, at December 31, 2005, our accounts receivable in excess of 90 days old totaled $16.8 million, or 5.7% of gross receivables outstanding. Our expense for self insurance as a percentage of revenue for 2003, 2004 and 2005 was 7.5%, 6.1% and 5.6%, respectively. The increase in self insurance expense during 2003 relative to 2004 and 2005 related to existing claims and was attributable to the expansion of our operations and various changes in estimates as a result of continued negative trends through our 2003 policy year, based on actuarial claims experience, expected claims development and medical cost inflation. We believe that during 2006, our self insurance expense will be in the range of 5.5% of revenue. 44 Property and Equipment The following tables reflect the activity in our property and equipment accounts for the years ended December 31, 2003, 2004 and 2005 (in millions): Gross Property and Equipment Cumulative Non Cash Effect of Additions for Balance as of Changes in Acquisitions, Asset Transfers and Balance as of December 31, Accounting Capital Net of Retirement Other December 31, 2002 Principles Additions Retirements Divestitures Obligations Adjustments 2003 Other land $ 89.7 $ $ 6.4 $ (1.7 ) $ $ $ $ 94.4 Non depletable landfill land 54.0 .1 .5 (5.1 ) 49.5 Landfill development costs 1,026.3 188.6 3.7 28.9 17.9 69.8 1,335.2 Vehicles and equipment 1,356.8 163.4 (39.3 ) 10.7 (1.0 ) 1,490.6 Buildings and improvements 270.9 (11.7 ) 3.9 (2.8 ) .9 6.2 267.4 Construction in progress landfill 32.3 78.7 (50.2 ) 60.8 Construction in progress other 9.1 17.0 (19.7 ) 6.4 Total $ 2,839.1 $ 176.9 $ 273.2 $ (43.8 ) $ 41.0 $ 17.9 $ $ 3,304.3 Accumulated Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion Cumulative Effect Balance as of of Changes in Additions Acquisitions, Transfers and Balance as of December 31, Accounting Charged to Net of Other December 31, 2002 Principles Expense Retirements Divestitures Adjustments 2003 Landfill development costs $ (304.1 ) $ (248.4 ) $ (92.8 ) $ $ $ .7 $ (644.6 ) Vehicles and equipment (570.1 ) (131.6 ) 34.1 .4 .8 (666.4 ) Buildings and improvements (54.9 ) 3.0 (9.4 ) .5 (1.5 ) (62.3 ) Total $ (929.1 ) $ (245.4 ) $ (233.8 ) $ 34.6 $ .4 $ $ (1,373.3 ) Gross Property and Equipment Non Cash Additions for Balance as of Acquisitions, Asset SFAS 143 Transfers and Balance as of December 31, Capital Net of Retirement Annual Other December 31, 2003 Additions Retirements Divestitures Obligations Adjustment Adjustments 2004 Other land $ 94.4 $ 3.1 $ (0.7 ) $ .9 $ $ $ .2 $ 97.9 Non depletable landfill land 49.5 1.0 1.5 1.4 53.4 Landfill development costs 1,335.2 6.6 (1.9 ) 28.9 19.6 (4.3 ) 102.4 1,486.5 Vehicles and equipment 1,490.6 169.1 (48.2 ) 5.3 .7 1,617.5 Buildings and improvements 267.4 11.4 (1.4 ) 1.0 8.6 287.0 Construction in progress landfill 60.8 78.9 (100.6 ) 39.1 Construction in progress other 6.4 13.7 (12.7 ) 7.4 Total $ 3,304.3 $ 283.8 $ (52.2 ) $ 37.6 $ 19.6 $ (4.3 ) $ $ 3,588.8 45 Accumulated Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion Balance as of Additions Acquisitions, Transfers and Balance as of December 31, Charged to Net of Other December 31, 2003 Expense Retirements Divestitures Adjustments 2004 Landfill development costs $ (644.6 ) $ (98.4 ) $ 1.9 $ (1.0 ) $ (.8 ) $ (742.9 ) Vehicles and equipment (666.4 ) (143.5 ) 43.5 .1 (766.3 ) Buildings and improvements (62.3 ) (10.5 ) 1.2 .8 (70.8 ) Total $ (1,373.3 ) $ (252.4 ) $ 46.6 $ (1.0 ) $ .1 $ (1,580.0 ) Gross Property and Equipment Non Cash Additions for Balance as of Acquisitions, Asset SFAS 143 Transfers and Balance as of December 31, Capital Net of Retirement Annual Other December 31, 2004 Additions Retirements Divestitures Obligations Adjustments Adjustments 2005 Other land $ 97.9 $ 2.7 $ (.5 ) $ (1.3 ) $ $ $ 2.1 $ 100.9 Non depletable landfill land 53.4 .4 (2.2 ) 51.6 Landfill development costs 1,486.5 24.3 (5.5 ) 59.7 20.4 (28.7 ) 73.3 1,630.0 Vehicles and equipment 1,617.5 195.0 (48.4 ) (18.7 ) 1.4 1,746.8 Buildings and improvements 287.0 5.3 (4.3 ) (.9 ) 287.1 Construction in progress landfill 39.1 83.7 (67.0 ) 55.8 Construction in progress other 7.4 17.3 (6.7 ) 18.0 Total $ 3,588.8 $ 328.7 $ (54.4 ) $ 35.4 $ 20.4 $ (28.7 ) $ $ 3,890.2 Accumulated Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion Balance as of Additions Acquisitions, SFAS 143 Balance as of December 31, Charged to Net of Annual December 31, 2004 Expense Retirements Divestitures Adjustments 2005 Landfill development costs $ (742.9 ) $ (104.2 ) $ $ (2.8 ) $ 20.6 $ (829.3 ) Vehicles and equipment (766.3 ) (156.8 ) 44.0 13.8 (865.3 ) Buildings and improvements (70.8 ) (10.7 ) .3 .9 (80.3 ) Total $ (1,580.0 ) $ (271.7 ) $ 44.3 $ 11.9 $ 20.6 $ (1,774.9 ) Liquidity and Capital Resources The major components of changes in cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 are discussed below. Cash Flows From Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $767.5 million, $666.3 million and $600.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The changes in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are due to the expansion of our business, the timing of payments received for accounts receivable, and the timing of payments for accounts payable and income taxes. In December 2003, we received written approval from the Internal Revenue Service to exclude probable expansion airspace from our calculation of landfill amortization, depletion, and final capping, closure and post closure expense for tax purposes. As a result of this change, we recorded a tax receivable of approximately $48.0 million which was collected or used to offset taxes payable during the year ended December 31, 2004. Also during the year ended December 31, 2004, we collected a $23.0 million note receivable associated with a divested business. Cash provided by operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2005 was higher than expected because of a $113.4 million federal tax payment that was deferred until February 2006 as a result of an Internal Revenue 46 Service notice issued in response to Hurricane Katrina, and the timing of payments for capital and other expenditures. As a result of the timing of these payments, we expect cash provided by operating activities during 2006 to be lower than 2005. We use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividend payments and debt repayments. Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities was $297.2 million, $206.7 million and $552.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and consists primarily of cash used for capital additions for all periods presented, cash provided by restricted marketable securities in 2004 and cash provided by the disposition of our operations in western New York in 2005. Capital additions were $328.7 million, $283.8 million and $273.2 million during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Cash used to acquire businesses, net of cash acquired, was $26.7 million, $47.3 million and $51.5 million during the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The increase in restricted marketable securities during 2003 consists of amounts transferred from unrestricted cash for financial guarantees. In 2004, we liquidated a portion of these marketable securities and used the proceeds to repay the $225.0 million of public notes. We used letters of credit to replace financial guarantees secured by marketable securities that were liquidated. We intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand, restricted cash held for capital expenditures, cash flow from operations, our revolving credit facility, tax exempt bonds and other financings. We expect to use primarily cash for future business acquisitions. Cash Flows Used In Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities was $480.0 million, $437.3 million and $70.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively, and primarily includes proceeds from issuances of tax exempt bonds, repayments of debt, repurchases of common stock under our stock repurchase program, proceeds from the issuance of common stock primarily related to equity based compensation and payments of cash dividends. Dividends paid were $72.2 million, $46.0 million and $19.0 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2004, repayments of debt include the liquidation of $225.0 million of public notes. From 2000 through 2005, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $1,525.0 million of our common stock. As of December 31, 2005, we paid $1,308.8 million to repurchase 51.5 million shares of our common stock, of which $558.4 million was paid during 2005 to repurchase 16.3 million shares of our common stock. We used proceeds from our cash on hand, liquidation of marketable securities, cash flow from operations, and tax exempt bonds to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions and to repay debt. We intend to finance future stock repurchases and dividend payments through cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our revolving credit facility and other financings. Credit Rating Our company has received investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2005, our senior debt was rated BBB+ by Standard & Poors, BBB+ by Fitch and Baa2 by Moodys. Fuel Hedge During March 2005, we entered into option agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases. Under SFAS 133, the options qualified for and were designated as effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases. These option agreements settle each month in equal notional amounts through December 2005. In accordance with SFAS 133, the ineffective portion of the change in fair value for the year ended December 31, 2005 was not material and has been included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Realized gains of $2.5 million related to these option agreements are included in cost of operations in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2005. 47 In October 2005, we entered into new option agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases. These option agreements commence on January 1, 2006 and settle each month in equal notional amounts of 500,000 gallons through December 31, 2006. In accordance with SFAS 133, $.4 million representing the effective portion of the change in fair value as of December 31, 2005, net of tax, has been recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value was not material and has been recorded in other income (expense), net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2005 (in millions): Maturities of Notes Payable and Final Other Capping, Amounts Due Unconditional Operating Capital Long Term Closure and to Former Purchase Year Ending December 31, Leases Leases Debt Post Closure Remediation Owners Commitments Total 2006 $ 4.5 $ .9 $ 2.1 $ 27.0 $ 3.1 $ 1.6 $ 16.9 $ 56.1 2007 3.7 1.0 1.6 19.1 9.8 3.5 38.7 2008 2.5 1.1 1.1 31.6 .5 2.1 38.9 2009 2.0 1.2 100.4 18.6 .3 2.1 124.6 2010 1.4 1.2 1.1 27.1 .3 2.1 33.2 Thereafter 3.9 56.6 1,341.1 348.9 36.3 13.4 1,800.2 Total $ 18.0 $ 62.0 $ 1,447.4 $ 472.3 $ 50.3 $ 1.6 $ 40.1 $ 2,091.7 The estimated remaining final capping, closure and post closure expenditures presented above are undiscounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of December 31, 2005. Unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of long term disposal agreements that require us to dispose of a minimum number of tons at third party facilities. Off Balance Arrangements We do not have or engage in any off balance sheet arrangements. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement. Our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates in the United States and fluctuations in LIBOR. We intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. All items described below are non trading. Expected Maturity Date Fair Value (Asset)/Liability December 31, 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total 2005 VARIABLE RATE DEBT: Amount outstanding (in millions) $ .3 $ $ $ $ $ 377.6 $ 377.9 $ 377.9 Average interest rates 3.7 % 3.8 % 3.8 % INTEREST RATE SWAPS: Amount outstanding (in millions) $ $ $ $ $ $ 210.0 $ 210.0 $ 5.5 Average interest rates 2.3 % 2.3 % 48 The fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable and, thus, approximate current market rates. Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the United States, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Our free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003 is calculated as follows (in millions): 2005 2004 2003 Cash provided by operating activities $ 767.5 $ 666.3 $ 600.5 Purchases of property and equipment (328.7 ) (283.8 ) (273.2 ) Proceeds from sales of property and equipment 10.1 5.7 9.1 Free cash flow $ 448.9 $ 388.2 $ 336.4 Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2005 was higher than the previous years presented primarily because of a $113.4 million federal tax payment that was deferred until February 2006 as a result of an Internal Revenue Service notice issued in response to Hurricane Katrina, and the timing of payments for capital and other expenditures. As a result of the timing of these payments, we expect free cash flow during 2006 to be lower than 2005. We believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided, pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment our existing business platform, repurchasing shares of common stock at prices that provide value to our shareholders, paying cash dividends, maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt. In addition, free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation. The presentation of free cash flow has material limitations. Free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Seasonality Our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding compensation), delay the collection and disposal of waste, reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites, or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities. New Accounting Pronouncements On December 16, 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, which is a revision of SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. SFAS 123(R) supersedes APB Opinion No. 25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees, and amends SFAS 95, Statement of Cash Flows. Generally, the approach in SFAS 123(R) is similar to the approach described in SFAS 123. However, SFAS 123(R) requires all share based payments to employees, including grants of employee stock options, to be recognized in the income statement based on their fair values. Pro forma disclosure is no longer an alternative. We are required to adopt SFAS 123(R) on January 1, 2006 and expect to use the modified prospective method in which compensation cost will be recognized beginning with the effective date based on the requirements of SFAS 123(R) for all share based payments granted after the effective date. 49 As permitted by SFAS 123, we currently account for share based payments to employees using APB 25s intrinsic value method and, as such, generally recognize no compensation cost for employee stock options. Accordingly, the adoption of SFAS 123(R)s fair value method may have a significant impact on our results of operations, although it will have no impact on our overall financial position. The impact of adoption of SFAS 123(R) depends on levels of share based payments granted in the future. We estimate that adopting SFAS 123(R) will reduce 2006 earnings per share by approximately three cents which includes incentive compensation granted in lieu of stock options. SFAS 123(R) requires the benefits of tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow, rather than as an operating cash flow as required under current literature. This requirement will reduce net operating cash flows and increase net financing cash flows in periods after adoption. While we cannot estimate what those amounts will be in the future (because they depend on, among other things, when employees exercise stock options), the amount of operating cash flows recognized in prior periods for such excess tax deductions were $29.4 million, $10.6 million, and $6.7 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Our board of directors approved the acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding stock options previously awarded to employees, effective December 30, 2005. As a result of this acceleration, we recorded a non cash charge of $2.1 million during the fourth quarter of 2005. This acceleration was made in advance of the effective date of SFAS 123(R) and in anticipation of changes to our compensation programs beginning in 2006. There are no other new accounting pronouncements that are significant to our company. 50
