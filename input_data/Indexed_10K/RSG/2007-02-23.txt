ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and their Notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Overview of Our Business We are a leading provider of non hazardous solid waste collection and disposal services in the United States. We provide solid waste collection services for commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers through 135 collection companies in 21 states. We also own or operate 93 transfer stations, 59 solid waste landfills and 33 recycling facilities. We generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations. Our remaining revenue is from other services including landfill disposal, recycling, compost, mulch and soil operations. The following table reflects our revenue by source for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Collection: Residential $ 734.3 23.9 % $ 683.6 23.9 % $ 655.2 24.2 % Commercial 860.1 28.0 781.1 27.3 737.9 27.2 Industrial 649.7 21.2 597.8 20.9 558.1 20.6 Other 74.3 2.4 76.6 2.6 62.2 2.3 Total collection 2,318.4 75.5 2,139.1 74.7 2,013.4 74.3 Transfer and disposal 1,182.1 1,108.6 1,031.0 Less: Intercompany (588.6 ) (560.1 ) (519.8 ) Transfer and disposal, net 593.5 19.3 548.5 19.1 511.2 18.9 Other 158.7 5.2 176.3 6.2 183.5 6.8 Revenue $ 3,070.6 100.0 % $ 2,863.9 100.0 % $ 2,708.1 100.0 % Our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers. Our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on long term contracts with municipalities. We generally provide industrial and commercial collection services to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years. Our revenue from landfill operations is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties. In general, we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials. No one customer has individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years. The cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes disposal, labor, self insurance, fuel and equipment maintenance costs. It also includes capital costs for equipment and facilities. We seek operating efficiencies by controlling the movement of waste from the point of collection through disposal. During the three months ended December 31, 2006 and 2005, approximately 56% and 57%, respectively, of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate. Our landfill costs include daily operating expenses, costs of capital for cell development, costs for final capping, closure and post closure, and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance. Daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal, methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance, interim cap maintenance, and costs associated with the application of daily cover materials. We expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred. We use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to cell development. In life cycle accounting, certain direct costs are capitalized, and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of 23 Table of Contents available airspace. These costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems, installation of groundwater monitoring wells, and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site. Obligations associated with final capping, closure and post closure are capitalized, and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed. Cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers. These estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to adjust our rates used to expense capitalized costs. Changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs, available airspace, inflation and applicable regulations. Changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates, changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted. Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the respective years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is shown in the following table: Depreciation, Amortization, Depletion and SFAS 143 Depreciation, Accretion Before Adjustments to Amortization, Operating Net SFAS 143 Amortization Depletion and Income Operating 2006 Revenue Adjustments Expense(a) Accretion (Loss) Margin Eastern Region $ 568.8 $ 44.6 $ (.9 ) $ 43.7 $ 92.4 16.2 % Central Region 635.1 92.6 (1.9 ) 90.7 111.4 17.5 Southern Region 798.1 73.8 1.5 75.3 153.6 19.2 Southwestern Region 334.3 35.4 (.8 ) 34.6 58.5 17.5 Western Region 735.8 61.8 (.2 ) 61.6 171.1 23.3 Corporate Entities (1.5 ) 5.8 5.8 (67.5 ) Total $ 3,070.6 $ 314.0 $ (2.3 ) $ 311.7 $ 519.5 16.9 Depreciation, Amortization, Depletion and SFAS 143 Depreciation, Accretion Before Adjustments to Amortization, Operating Net SFAS 143 Amortization Depletion and Income Operating 2005 Revenue Adjustments Expense(a) Accretion (Loss) Margin Eastern Region $ 543.7 $ 45.3 $ (.7 ) $ 44.6 $ 92.2 17.0 % Central Region 567.8 81.3 .9 82.2 103.5 18.2 Southern Region 734.7 74.0 (.4 ) 73.6 121.4 16.5 Southwestern Region 320.8 33.5 (4.2 ) 29.3 50.9 15.9 Western Region 693.9 58.8 .6 59.4 163.9 23.6 Corporate Entities 3.0 4.2 4.2 (54.7 ) Total $ 2,863.9 $ 297.1 $ (3.8 ) $ 293.3 $ 477.2 16.7 Depreciation, Amortization, Depletion and SFAS 143 Depreciation, Accretion Before Adjustments to Amortization, Operating Net SFAS 143 Amortization Depletion and Income Operating 2004 Revenue Adjustments Expense(a) Accretion (Loss) Margin Eastern Region $ 545.4 $ 43.2 $ .6 $ 43.8 $ 81.4 14.9 % Central Region 544.3 79.3 .1 79.4 102.6 18.8 Southern Region 672.3 68.6 (1.9 ) 66.7 112.8 16.8 Southwestern Region 309.1 31.1 (.5 ) 30.6 42.2 13.7 Western Region 636.5 51.0 (2.7 ) 48.3 160.6 25.2 Corporate Entities .5 4.3 4.3 (47.3 ) Total $ 2,708.1 $ 277.5 $ (4.4 ) $ 273.1 $ 452.3 16.7 (a) Consists of adjustments to amortization expense for changes in estimates and assumptions related to our review of landfill asset retirement obligations under SFAS 143. 24 Table of Contents Our operations are managed and reviewed through five regions that we designate as our reportable segments. From 2004 to 2006, operating income increased in all of our regions due to the successful execution of our pricing strategy. 2006 compared to 2005: Revenue in our Eastern Region increased during 2006 compared to 2005 due to price increases in our collection and landfill lines of business and due to increased volume in our industrial collection and landfill businesses. This increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased volume in our commercial and residential collection businesses and by the sale of our operations in western New York during the three months ended March 31, 2005. Operating margins decreased from 2005 to 2006 due to higher landfill operating and fuel costs partially offset by higher revenue. In our Central Region, revenue increased during 2006 compared to 2005 due to price increases in our collection and landfill lines of business and volume growth in our landfill line of business arising from favorable economic conditions. Operating margins decreased primarily due to increased third party hauling costs associated with our company assuming responsibility for hauling waste from the city of Toronto to one of our landfills in Michigan. This increase in costs was partially offset by adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with SFAS 143. Our operations in the Southern Region experienced the greatest margin improvement of all of our segments because of price increases and volume growth in our collection and landfill lines of business. Operating margins increased because of an increase in revenue arising from favorable economic conditions, partially offset by higher fuel costs and adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with SFAS 143. Operating margins also improved during 2006 because of higher costs incurred during the fourth quarter of 2005 related to hurricane clean up. In our Southwestern Region, revenue increased due to price increases and volume growth in our collection and landfill lines of business, partially offset by the sale of our remediation and heavy construction services business during the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase in operating margins from 2005 to 2006 is attributable to an increase in revenue arising from improving economic conditions, partially offset by higher fuel costs and adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with SFAS 143. In our Western Region, revenue increased due to price increases and volume growth in our collection and landfill lines of business. Operating margins decreased from 2005 to 2006 because of higher fuel, labor and insurance costs, partially offset by an increase in revenue during 2006 and adjustments for landfill amortization expense associated with SFAS 143. The increase in operating costs for Corporate Entities from 2005 to 2006 is due to the expansion of our business, incremental costs associated with our adoption of SFAS 123(R), additional costs associated with our 401(k) plan resulting from an increase in the employers matching contribution percentage and an increase in other incentive compensation. 2005 compared to 2004: During the first quarter of 2005, we divested of our operations in western New York which reduced revenue in our Eastern Region. This reduction in revenue was almost completely offset by increases in prices. Operating margins improved because of increases in prices and lower average disposal costs resulting from the New York divestiture. In our Central Region, price increases and acquisitions resulted in higher revenue during 2005 compared to 2004. Operating margins decreased primarily due to higher fuel costs partially offset by lower subcontracting and third party hauling costs. Our operations in the Southern Region benefited from stronger volumes in our collection, transfer and landfill businesses. Operating margins decreased primarily due to higher fuel costs and higher costs 25 Table of Contents incurred during the fourth quarter of 2005 related to hurricane clean up, partially offset by decreases in labor and maintenance costs resulting from operating efficiencies. In our Southwestern Region, increased revenue resulting from increased prices and volumes was partially offset by a decrease in revenue at our remediation and heavy construction services business. This business was sold in the fourth quarter of 2005. Operating margins improved because of a decrease in subcontracting costs and due to adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with SFAS 143. In our Western Region, increases in prices and volumes in our collection, transfer and landfill operations resulted in higher revenue during 2005 compared to 2004. Operating margins decreased because of higher fuel and disposal costs and because of adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with SFAS 143. The increase in operating loss for Corporate Entities from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to higher compensation and other costs related to the expansion of our business, approximately $3.0 million of costs associated with the exchange of unsecured notes during 2005 and $2.1 million related to the acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding stock options in 2005. 2006 Financial Objectives In January 2006, we publicly announced our objectives for the year. These objectives included the following: Generating free cash flow (a non GAAP measure) in the range of $270 to $280 million. This guidance excluded federal tax payments for 2005 that had been deferred until February 2006 as a result of an Internal Revenue Service notice issued in response to Hurricane Katrina. In July 2006, we increased our range of anticipated free cash flow to approximately $280 to $290 million. Using our free cash flow to repurchase our common stock under our existing $491 million share repurchase programs. Generating diluted earnings per share of $1.90 to $1.93. We updated our earnings per share guidance in July 2006 to a new range of $1.94 to $1.97 per diluted share and in November 2006 to a new range of $2.03 to $2.06 per diluted share. Growing revenue from core operations by approximately 5%, with 3.5% attributable to price increases and 1.5% attributable to volume growth. Purchasing approximately $315 million of property and equipment. 2006 Business Performance During 2006, we exceeded all of our financial objectives. Our internal growth from core operations for 2006 was 7.2%, with 4.8% from price increases and 2.4% from volume growth. During 2006, our revenue growth from core pricing continued to benefit from a broad based pricing initiative which we started during the fourth quarter of 2003. The broad based price increases we secured offset various escalating capital and operating costs, including fuel. We experienced core volume growth in all lines of our business, including our residential collection business. During 2006, our core volume growth was negatively impacted by hurricane clean up efforts that took place during the fourth quarter of 2005. However, our geographic mix of business, which is concentrated in high growth markets, positively impacted our operating results. As a result, during 2006 we were able to exceed the internal growth objectives we established at the beginning of the year. Our operating margins increased by .20% from 16.7% in 2005 to 16.9% in 2006. During 2006, improved pricing and continued focus on productivity improvements offset higher fuel and landfill operating costs. During 2006, we generated free cash flow of $203.0 million (consisting of cash provided by operating activities of $522.1 million, less purchases of property and equipment of $337.6 million, plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment of $18.5 million). Our free cash flow was negatively impacted by an $83.0 million federal 26 Table of Contents tax payment for 2005 that had been deferred until February 2006 as a result of an Internal Revenue Service notice issued in response to Hurricane Katrina. Excluding this federal tax payment, our free cash flow for 2006 would have been $286.0 million which exceeded our original guidance. During 2006, we used our free cash flow to repurchase 12.2 million shares of our common stock, or approximately 9% of our outstanding shares, for $492.0 million. Also, during the third quarter of 2006, our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend to $.16 per share. During 2006, we generated diluted earnings per share of $2.07 which significantly exceeded our initial objective. 2007 Financial Objectives Our financial objectives for 2007 assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of 2006. Specific guidance is as follows: We expect to generate free cash flow in excess of 100% of net income, or approximately $315 million. We anticipate using our free cash flow to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock under our existing $250 million share repurchase program. We also anticipate using our free cash flow to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends. We anticipate diluted earnings of $2.25 to $2.28 per share. In January 2007, our board of directors approved a 3 for 2 stock split effective on March 16, 2007 for stockholders of record on March 5, 2007. Adjusted for the 3 for 2 stock split, we anticipate earnings of $1.50 to $1.52 per share. We are targeting internal growth from core operations to be approximately 4% to 4.5%, with approximately 3% to 3.5% attributable to price increases and approximately 1% attributable to volume growth. We anticipate purchasing approximately $310 million of property and equipment, net of sales of property and equipment. 2007 Business Initiatives Our business initiatives for 2007 are generally a continuation of those initiated in prior years and are dependent on further standardizing our business processes and improving our systems. Ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and processes and are trained on our systems is essential to the overall success of our initiatives. Our business initiatives for 2007 are as follows: Pricing initiatives. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we implemented a broad based pricing initiative across all lines of our business. The purpose of this initiative is to recover increasing costs and improve operating margins. We realized the benefit of this initiative during the past several years and expect a continuing benefit during 2007. Improve business integration. During 2005, we took a number of steps to further strengthen our business platform and improve our business integration. In response to limited vertical integration opportunities, we divested of our operations in western New York. We acquired a landfill in the Dallas/Fort Worth area which better integrated that marketplace. In addition, we divested of our remediation and heavy construction services business because it did not complement our core business strategy. We plan to continue to develop and implement strategies that improve the performance of locations and lines of business that are performing below the companys average. To achieve this objective, we may purchase operations from, sell operations to or exchange operations with other companies in the future. Improve the quality of our revenue. The first step in this process was completed in 2001 and included installing a standardized billing and operating system. This system enables us to, among other things, stratify our customers to determine how our rates compare to current market pricing. During 2002, we implemented the second generation of this software which we call RSI 1.0. RSI 1.0, our companys core business system, provides a variety of functionalities including customer service, dispatch, billing, sales analysis, account retention and route productivity analysis. During 2006, we completed the development of the next 27 Table of Contents generation of our billing and operating system. This system provides additional functionality to our operating locations and further standardizes our billing and operating processes. During 2007, we will continue to ensure that our operating personnel are properly trained on this system and using it as intended. We currently monitor our return on investment by marketplace and have instituted a return on investment pricing model. This model will eventually allow us to track our return on investment by customer. We use a customer relationship management system. This system improves the productivity of our sales force by helping to establish marketing priorities and track sales leads. It also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial, industrial and franchise contracts. During 2007, we will continue to ensure our sales force is properly trained on this system and is using it as intended. Improve the productivity of our operations. We use a grid productivity program that enables us to benchmark the performance of our drivers. In addition, in our larger markets, we use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and improve operational density. During 2007, we will continue to update our disposal optimization metrics. These metrics identify which local disposal option maximizes our return on invested capital and cash flow. Improve fleet management and procurement. In February 2002, we selected Dossier as our fleet management and parts procurement system. During 2003, we implemented Dossier at all of our significant hauling and landfill operations. Among other features, this system tracks parts inventories, generates automatic quantity order points and logs all maintenance work. It allows us to capture and review information to ensure our preventive maintenance programs comply with manufacturers warranties and governmental regulations. In addition, the purchase order module within this system allows us to cross reference purchasing information with our inventory. During 2007, we intend to further utilize this purchase order module to take advantage of volume discounts. Enhance operational and financial reporting systems. We have several initiatives aimed at improving our operational and financial reporting systems. The overall goal of these initiatives is to provide us with detailed information, prepared in a consistent manner, that will allow us to quickly analyze and act upon trends in our business. One of our most significant systems is our enterprise wide general ledger package. We successfully converted all of our locations to Lawson general ledger software in 2002 and in 2003 successfully converted all of our locations to Lawson fixed asset software. During December 2006, we successfully converted all of our locations to Lawson enterprise wide human resource software. This software provides a number of direct benefits including a reduction in payroll processing and compliance costs and integration into our general ledger software. It also provides a number of indirect benefits including better information concerning labor and related costs and better control over employee related initiatives such as training. All of the system initiatives mentioned above provide us with more consistent and detailed information, thus allowing us to make quicker and more informed business decisions. In addition, all of our significant software applications are standardized and centralized at our data center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This standardization and centralization provides us with consolidated information concerning our operations across a variety of operational and financial disciplines. It also significantly enhances our ability to execute our disaster recovery plan. Expand our safety training programs. As part of our ongoing emphasis on safe work practices and in light of increasing insurance costs, we expanded our safety training programs in 2002. During 2004, we distributed a comprehensive training and safety manual to all of our locations. Safety will continue to be a key area of focus during 2007. 28 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Disclosures Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management. The following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain: Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Landfill Accounting: Life Cycle Accounting We use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain landfill costs over the life of the site. In life cycle accounting, all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized, and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. Obligations associated with final capping, closure and post closure are capitalized, and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed. Cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers. Changes in these estimates could significantly affect our amortization, depletion and accretion expense. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Landfill and Environmental Matters. Note 3, Landfill and Environmental Costs in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Probable Expansion Airspace We include in our calculation of total available airspace expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood that the expansion area will ultimately be permitted. We have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace. We believe that satisfying each of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted. However, because some of these criteria are judgmental, they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted. In either of these scenarios, our amortization, depletion and accretion expense could change significantly. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Landfill and Environmental Matters. Note 3, Landfill and Environmental Costs in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 29 Table of Contents Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Final Capping, Closure and Post Closure We account for our final capping, closure and post closure activities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Under SFAS 143, obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event. Obligations related to closure and post closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire landfill life. Landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units of consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed throughout the entire landfill, depending on the nature of the obligation. All obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value. Fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and the companys credit adjusted, risk free rate. Future costs for final capping, closure and post closure are developed at least annually by engineers, and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections. Changes in any of these estimates could affect our amortization of final capping, closure and post closure costs and our accretion expense.

Note 3, Landfill and Environmental Costs in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 30 Table of Contents Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Self Insurance: Our insurance programs for workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured. Self insurance accruals are based on claims reported and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported. Estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported are developed actuarially. If actual claims experience or development is significantly different than our estimates, our self insurance expense would change. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Selected Balance Sheet Accounts. Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Property and Equipment: Expenditures for Improvements, Repairs and Maintenance Expenditures for major additions and improvements to facilities are capitalized. All expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred. Whether certain expenditures improve an asset or lengthen its useful life is subject to our judgment. Accordingly, the actual useful lives of our assets could differ from our estimates. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Property and Equipment. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents their estimated net realizable value. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded based on historical collection experience, the age of the receivables, specific customer information and economic conditions. In general, reserves are provided for accounts receivable in excess of 90 days old. Accounts receivable are written off when they are deemed uncollectible. Establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our accounts receivable reserve is a matter of judgment. If our judgment and estimates concerning the adequacy of our reserve for accounts receivable is incorrect, bad debt expense would change. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Selected Balance Sheet Accounts. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 31 Table of Contents Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Income Taxes: We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Accordingly, deferred taxes have been provided to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. After the initial recognition of a deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance is provided if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and the realizability of net operating losses for tax purposes are based on our judgment. If our judgment and estimates concerning valuation allowances and the realizability of net operating losses are incorrect, our provision for income taxes would change. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 6, Income Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Combinations We make decisions to acquire or invest in businesses based on financial and strategic considerations. Businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. We acquired various solid waste businesses during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The aggregate purchase prices we paid for these transactions was $4.9 million, $26.7 million and $47.4 million, respectively. In addition, during 2005, we entered into a $53.9 million capital lease related to a landfill. We divested of our operations in western New York during the three months ended March 31, 2005 and received proceeds of $29.1 million. A gain of $3.3 million was recorded in 2005 on the divestiture. In addition, during the three months ended December 31, 2005, we sold our environmental remediation company and received proceeds of $1.2 million. A loss of $2.0 million was recorded in 2005 on the divestiture. Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) for 2006 acquisitions totaled $1.0 million. As of December 31, 2006 we had goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,562.9 million. Goodwill for 2005 acquisitions totaled $16.6 million. As of December 31, 2005, we had goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,563.8 million. $57.9 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace during 2005. When a landfill is acquired as part of a group of assets, purchase price is allocated to airspace based on the discounted expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within the acquired group and is adjusted for other landfill assets and liabilities acquired (which are primarily for final capping, closure and post closure obligations). Landfill purchase price is amortized using the units of consumption method over total available airspace, which includes probable expansion airspace where appropriate. 32 Table of Contents Goodwill for 2004 acquisitions totaled $13.2 million. As of December 31, 2004, we had goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,562.7 million. $28.2 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace. Consolidated Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 Our net income was $279.6 million for the year ended December 31, 2006, or $2.07 per diluted share, as compared to $253.7 million, or $1.75 per diluted share, in 2005 and $237.9 million, or $1.53 per diluted share, in 2004. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded a $5.1 million net income tax benefit in our provision for income taxes. This benefit relates to the resolution of various income tax matters including the effective completion of federal tax audits for the years 1998 through 2000. We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective transition method. As a result of adopting SFAS 123(R), we recorded $5.5 million of incremental equity based compensation expense during the year ended December 31, 2006. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, our Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of adopting SFAS 123(R).

Revenue was $3,070.6 million, $2,863.9 million, and $2,708.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Revenue increased by $206.7 million, or 7.2%, from 2005 to 2006. Revenue increased by $155.8 million, or 5.8%, from 2004 to 2005. The following table reflects the components of our revenue growth for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: 2006 2005 2004 Core price 3.4 % 2.7 % 2.3 % Fuel surcharges 1.1 .8 .2 Environmental fees .4 .2 Recycling commodities (.1 ) .1 .5 Total price 4.8 3.8 3.0 Core volume(a) 2.4 2.5 3.6 Non core volume (.2 ) .1 Total volume 2.4 2.3 3.7 Total internal growth 7.2 6.1 6.7 Acquisitions, net of divestitures (.1 ) (.4 ) .9 Taxes(b) .1 .1 Total revenue growth 7.2 % 5.8 % 7.6 % (a) Core volume growth for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes .8% associated with hauling waste from the city of Toronto to one of our landfills in Michigan. This hauling service is provided to the city at a rate that approximates our cost. (b) Represents new taxes levied on landfill volumes in certain states that are passed on to customers. 2006: During the year ended December 31, 2006, our revenue growth continued to benefit from a broad based pricing initiative which we started during the fourth quarter of 2003. We experienced core volume growth in our collection and landfill lines of business. This core volume growth was partially offset by hurricane clean up efforts that took place during the fourth quarter of 2005. 2005: During the year ended December 31, 2005, our revenue growth from core pricing continued to benefit from our broad based pricing initiative. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we experienced core volume growth in our residential collection, industrial collection and landfill businesses. Our core volume growth was also positively impacted by hurricane clean up efforts. In June 2005, we began assessing environmental fees on the non franchise portion of our customer base. 2004: During the year ended December 31, 2004, our revenue growth from core pricing benefited from our broad based pricing initiative. During the year ended December 31, 2004, we experienced core volume growth in all lines of our business, including our residential collection business resulting from the addition of several new municipal contracts, and our landfill and transfer station businesses resulting from newly opened sites and new contracts. 2007 Outlook: We anticipate internal growth from core operations to be approximately 4% to 4.5% during 2007 assuming no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of 2006. However, our price and volume growth may remain flat or may decline in 2007 depending on economic conditions and our success in implementing pricing initiatives. Cost of Operations. Cost of operations was $1,924.4 million, $1,803.9 million and $1,714.4 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 62.7%, 63.0% and 63.3%, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in aggregate dollars in all periods presented is primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through internal growth. 34 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Subcontractor, disposal and third party fees $ 718.7 23.4 % $ 694.9 24.3 % $ 667.8 24.7 % Labor and benefits 588.5 19.2 557.3 19.5 536.2 19.8 Maintenance and operating 457.3 14.9 401.2 14.0 355.5 13.1 Insurance and other 159.9 5.2 150.5 5.2 154.9 5.7 Total $ 1,924.4 62.7 % $ 1,803.9 63.0 % $ 1,714.4 63.3 % A description of our cost categories is as follows: Subcontractor, disposal and third party fees include costs such as third party disposal, transportation of waste, host fees and cost of goods sold. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus the comparable 2005 period is primarily due to higher revenue resulting from improved pricing and costs incurred during the fourth quarter of 2005 related to hurricane clean up. This benefit was partially offset by additional third party hauling costs incurred during 2006 associated with our company assuming responsibility for hauling waste from the city of Toronto to one of our landfills in Michigan. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to improved pricing, a change in the mix of revenue and continued focus on productivity improvements, partially offset by higher fuel related subcontracting costs and costs incurred during the fourth quarter of 2005 related to hurricane clean up. Labor and benefits include costs such as wages, salaries, payroll taxes and health benefits for our frontline service employees and their supervisors. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus the comparable 2005 period is primarily due to higher revenue resulting from improved pricing and productivity improvements in our commercial and industrial collection lines of business. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to improved pricing, a change in revenue mix and continued focus on productivity improvements. Maintenance and operating includes costs such as fuel, parts, shop labor and benefits, third party repairs, and landfill monitoring and operating. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus the comparable 2005 period is primarily due to increases in fuel and landfill operating costs. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to an increase in fuel expense. The cost of fuel as a percentage of revenue increased by .6% from 2005 to 2006 and by 1.0% from 2004 to 2005. Insurance and other includes costs such as workers compensation, auto and general liability insurance, property taxes, property maintenance and utilities. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2005 versus the comparable 2004 period is primarily due to favorable claims development. The cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies. As such, care should be taken when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies. Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion of Property and Equipment. Depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were $289.0 million, $271.7 million and $252.4 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 9.4%, 9.5% and 9.3%, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in aggregate dollars for the periods presented is primarily due to the expansion of our operations through internal growth and acquisitions. The slight decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2006 versus the comparable 2005 period is due to lower depletion expense during 2006. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2005 versus the 35 Table of Contents comparable 2004 period is due to an increase in depreciation expense associated with vehicles and equipment acquired in 2005. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Intangible assets consist primarily of costs in excess of fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill), but also includes values assigned to long term contracts, covenants not to compete and customer relationships. Expenses for amortization of intangible assets were $7.0 million, $7.1 million and $7.0 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, .2%, .2% and .3%, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Accretion Expense. Accretion expense was $15.7 million, $14.5 million and $13.7 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, .5% for each of the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004. The increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars in 2006 and 2005 is primarily due to an increase in asset retirement obligations. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $315.0 million, $289.5 million and $268.3 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 10.3%, 10.1% and 9.9%, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increases in aggregate dollars for the periods presented are primarily a result of the expansion of our business. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from 2005 to 2006 is due to incremental costs associated with our adoption of SFAS 123(R), additional costs associated with our 401(k) plan resulting from an increase in the employers matching contribution percentage and an increase in other incentive compensation. During the year ended December 31, 2006, we incurred $5.5 million of incremental costs associated with our adoption of SFAS 123(R). These increases in costs during the year ended December 31, 2006 were partially offset by an increase in revenue. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to approximately $3.0 million of costs associated with the exchange of unsecured notes during 2005 and a $2.1 million non cash charge incurred during 2005 related to the acceleration of the vesting of all outstanding stock options. We believe that selling, general and administrative expenses of approximately 10% of revenue are appropriate for 2007 given our business platform. Operating Income. Operating income was $519.5 million, $477.2 million and $452.3 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 16.9%, 16.7% and 16.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest Expense. We incurred interest expense primarily on our unsecured notes and tax exempt bonds. Interest expense was $95.8 million, $81.0 million and $76.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in interest expense from 2005 to 2006 is primarily due to an increase in debt balances and an increase in interest rates on our floating rate debt. The increase from 2004 to 2005 is primarily due to an increase in interest rates on our floating rate debt, an increase in debt balances and fees associated with the refinancing of our credit facility in 2005. Capitalized interest was $2.7 million, $2.0 million and $2.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Interest Income and Other Income (Expense), Net. Interest income and other income, net of other expense, was $20.0 million, $13.0 million and $8.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The increase in aggregate dollars during the years presented is primarily due to an increase in interest income on cash and restricted cash balances resulting from higher interest rates. In May 2004, we used primarily marketable securities balances to repay $225.0 million of public notes. Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes was $164.1 million, $155.5 million and $145.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Our effective income tax rate was 37.0% for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 38.0% for the years ended December 31, 2005 and 2004. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes a $5.1 million benefit related to the favorable resolution of various income tax matters, including the effective completion of federal tax audits for the years 1998 through 2000. 36 Table of Contents Landfill and Environmental Matters Available Airspace The following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004: Balance as of Permits Changes in Balance as of December 31, Granted, Airspace Engineering December 31, 2005 Net of Closures Consumed Estimates 2006 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,577.7 56.6 (43.5 ) 6.4 1,597.2 Number of sites 59 59 Probable expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 177.7 (52.5 ) (.6 ) 124.6 Number of sites 9 (1 ) 8 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,755.4 4.1 (43.5 ) 5.8 1,721.8 Number of sites 59 59 Landfills Balance as of New Acquired Permits Changes in Changes Balance as of December 31, Expansions or Divested, Granted, Airspace Engineering in December 31, 2004 Undertaken Net Net of Closures Consumed Estimates Design 2005 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,529.6 17.9 64.8 (43.6 ) 7.4 1.6 1,577.7 Number of sites 58 1 59 Probable expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 222.2 8.3 (52.7 ) (.3 ) .2 177.7 Number of sites 12 1 (4 ) 9 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,751.8 8.3 17.9 12.1 (43.6 ) 7.1 1.8 1,755.4 Number of sites 58 1 59 Landfills Balance as of Acquired Permits Changes in Changes Balance as of December 31, or Divested, Granted, Airspace Engineering in December 31, 2003 Net Net of Closures Consumed Estimates Design 2004 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,498.6 24.4 48.6 (42.1 ) .1 1,529.6 Number of sites 58 1 (1 ) 58 Probable expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 268.7 (48.6 ) .1 2.0 222.2 Number of sites 15 (3 ) 12 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,767.3 24.4 (42.1 ) .2 2.0 1,751.8 Number of sites 58 1 (1 ) 58 Changes in engineering estimates typically include minor modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information. Changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfills footprint or vertical slopes. At December 31, 2003, 15.2% of our total available airspace, or 268.7 million cubic yards, consisted of probable expansion airspace at fifteen of our landfills. At December 31, 2006, 7.2% of our total available airspace, or 124.6 million cubic yards, consisted of probable expansion airspace at eight of our landfills. This decrease in probable expansion airspace demonstrates our continued success in obtaining permits for expansion airspace. During 2006, total available airspace decreased by 33.6 million cubic yards primarily due to airspace consumption, partially offset by permits granted and changes in engineering estimates. During 2005, total available airspace increased by 3.6 million cubic yards primarily due to new expansions undertaken, the acquisition of a 37 Table of Contents landfill, permits granted and changes in engineering estimates, partially offset by airspace consumed. During 2004, total available airspace decreased by 15.5 million cubic yards primarily due to airspace consumption, partially offset by the acquisition of a landfill. As of December 31, 2006, we owned or operated 59 solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 1.7 billion in place cubic yards. Total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace. These estimates are developed at least annually by engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys. As of December 31, 2006, total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 1.6 billion in place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus .1 billion in place cubic yards of probable expansion airspace. Before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and, therefore, included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity, it must meet all of our expansion criteria. See Note 3, Landfill and Environmental Costs, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2006, eight of our landfills meet all of our criteria for including probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity. At projected annual volumes, these eight landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 29 years, including probable expansion airspace. The average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 27 years. The following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of December 31, 2006: Number of Sites without Number of Sites with Total Percent Expansion Airspace Expansion Airspace Sites of Total 0 to 5 years 6 6 10.2 % 6 to 10 years 8 8 13.6 11 to 20 years 12 2 14 23.7 21 to 40 years 16 5 21 35.6 41+ years 9 1 10 16.9 Total 51 8 59 100.0 % Sites with expansion airspace include one landfill with less than five years of remaining permitted airspace. Final Capping, Closure and Post Closure Costs As of December 31, 2006, accrued final capping, closure and post closure costs were $257.6 million. The current portion of these costs of $29.0 million is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in other current liabilities. The long term portion of these costs of $228.6 million is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs. Investment in Landfills The following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 and the future expected investment as of December 31, 2006 (in millions): Non Cash Additions SFAS 143 Balance as of for Asset Adjustments to Additions Transfers Balance as of December 31, Capital Retire Retirement Amortization Charged to and Other December 31, 2005 Additions ments Obligations Expense Expense Adjustments 2006 Non depletable landfill land $ 51.6 $ 1.1 $ $ $ $ $ $ 52.7 Landfill development costs 1,630.0 1.6 (7.0 ) 22.8 (10.3 ) 85.1 1,722.2 Construction in progress landfill 55.8 90.1 (84.8 ) 61.1 Accumulated depletion and amortization (829.3 ) 7.0 .3 (108.1 ) (.5 ) (930.6 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 908.1 $ 92.8 $ $ 22.8 $ (10.0 ) $ (108.1 ) $ (.2 ) $ 905.4 38 Table of Contents Balance as of Expected Total December 31, Future Expected 2006 Investment Investment Non depletable landfill land $ 52.7 $ $ 52.7 Landfill development costs 1,722.2 1,603.8 3,326.0 Construction in progress landfill 61.1 61.1 Accumulated depletion and amortization (930.6 ) (930.6 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 905.4 $ 1.603.8 $ 2,509.2 Non Cash Additions SFAS 143 Balance as of for Asset Adjustments to Additions Transfers Balance as of December 31, Capital Retire Landfill Retirement Amortization Charged to and Other December 31, 2004 Additions ments Acquisitions Obligations Expense Expense Adjustments 2005 Non depletable landfill land $ 53.4 $ .4 $ $ $ $ $ $ (2.2 ) $ 51.6 Landfill development costs 1,486.5 24.3 (5.5 ) 59.7 20.4 (28.7 ) 73.3 1,630.0 Construction in progress landfill 39.1 83.7 (67.0 ) 55.8 Accumulated depletion and amortization (742.9 ) (2.8 ) 20.6 (104.2 ) (829.3 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 836.1 $ 108.4 $ (5.5 ) $ 56.9 $ 20.4 $ (8.1 ) $ (104.2 ) $ 4.1 $ 908.1 Non Cash Additions SFAS 143 Balance as of for Asset Adjustments to Additions Transfers Balance as of December 31, Capital Retire Landfill Retirement Amortization Charged to and Other December 31, 2003 Additions ments Acquisitions Obligations Expense Expense Adjustments 2004 Non depletable landfill land $ 49.5 $ 1.0 $ $ 1.5 $ $ $ $ 1.4 $ 53.4 Landfill development costs 1,335.2 6.6 (1.9 ) 28.9 19.6 (4.3 ) 102.4 1,486.5 Construction in progress landfill 60.8 78.9 (100.6 ) 39.1 Accumulated depletion and amortization (644.6 ) 1.9 (1.0 ) (98.4 ) (.8 ) (742.9 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 800.9 $ 86.5 $ $ 29.4 $ 19.6 $ (4.3 ) $ (98.4 ) $ 2.4 $ 836.1 The following table reflects our net investment in our landfills, excluding non depletable land, and our depletion, amortization and accretion expense for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004: Years Ended December 31, 2006 2005 2004 Number of landfills owned or operated 59 59 58 Net investment, excluding non depletable land (in millions) $ 852.7 $ 856.5 $ 782.7 Total estimated available disposal capacity (in millions of cubic yards) 1,721.8 1,755.4 1,751.8 Net investment per cubic yard $ .50 $ .49 $ .45 Landfill depletion and amortization expense (in millions) $ 108.1 $ 104.2 $ 98.4 Accretion expense (in millions) 15.7 14.5 13.7 123.8 118.7 112.1 Airspace consumed (in millions of cubic yards) 43.5 43.6 42.1 Depletion, amortization and accretion expense per cubic yard of airspace consumed $ 2.85 $ 2.72 $ 2.66 39 Table of Contents During the twelve months ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, our weighted average compaction rate was approximately 1,500 pounds per cubic yard based on our three year historical moving average. Our compaction rates may improve as a result of the settlement and decomposition of waste. As of December 31, 2006, we expect to spend an estimated additional $1.6 billion on existing landfills, primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures, over their expected remaining lives. Our total expected investment, excluding non depletable land, estimated to be $2.5 billion, or $1.43 per cubic yard, is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the units of consumption method. We accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated. We accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities associated with properties acquired through business combinations as a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace, as appropriate. During the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, we charged $8.5 million, $.1 million and $1.7 million, respectively, to income for remediation costs. During 2006, we incurred costs at one of our active landfills associated with the remediation of waste that was deposited during the mid 1990s. Financial Condition At December 31, 2006 we had $29.1 million of cash and cash equivalents. We also had $153.3 million of restricted cash deposits, including $65.6 million of restricted cash held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities. In June 2005, we entered into a $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks which expires in 2010. This facility replaced our prior facilities which aggregated $750.0 million. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at LIBOR based rates. We use our operating cash flow and proceeds from our credit facilities to finance our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and other requirements. As of December 31, 2006, we had $266.5 million available under our credit facility. In May 1999, we sold $600.0 million of unsecured notes in the public market. $225.0 million of these notes bore interest at 6.625% per annum and matured in May 2004. The remaining $375.0 million bear interest at 7.125% per annum and mature in 2009. Interest on these notes is payable semi annually in May and November. The $225.0 million and $375.0 million in notes were offered at a discount of $1.0 million and $.5 million, respectively. In March 2005, we exchanged $275.7 million of our outstanding 7.125% notes due 2009 for new notes due 2035. The new notes bear interest at 6.086%. We paid a premium of $27.6 million related to the exchange. This premium is being amortized over the life of the new notes using the effective yield method. In August 2001, we sold $450.0 million of unsecured notes in the public market. The notes bear interest at 6.75% and mature in 2011. Interest on these notes is payable semi annually in February and August. The notes were offered at a discount of $2.6 million. In March 2005, we entered into a $53.9 million capital lease related to a landfill. In order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates and to take advantage of favorable floating interest rates, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment grade rated financial institutions. The swap agreements have total notional values of $225.0 million and $210.0 million, respectively, and require our company to pay interest at floating rates based on changes in LIBOR and receive interest at fixed rates of 6.625% and 6.75%, respectively. Swap agreements with a notional value of $225.0 million matured in May 2004, and agreements with a notional value of $210.0 million mature in August 2011. At December 31, 2006, we had $674.2 million of tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings outstanding of which $30.0 million were obtained during fiscal 2006. Borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on fixed or floating interest rates at the prevailing market ranging from 3.25% to 5.63% at December 31, 2006 and have maturities ranging from 2012 to 2037. As of December 31, 2006, we had $65.6 million of restricted cash related to proceeds from tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings. This restricted cash will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements. 40 Table of Contents We believe that our excess cash, cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facility provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due. We believe that we will be able to raise additional debt or equity financing, if necessary. Selected Balance Sheet Accounts The following tables reflect the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts, final capping, closure, post closure and remediation liabilities and accrued self insurance during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 (in millions): Final Capping, Allowance for Closure and Doubtful Accounts Post Closure Remediation Self Insurance Balance, December 31, 2005 $ 17.3 $ 239.5 $ 50.3 $ 158.6 Non cash asset additions 22.8 Revisions in estimates of future cash flows recorded as non cash asset additions (10.0 ) Accretion expense 15.7 Other additions charged to expense 8.4 8.5 164.4 Payments or usage (6.9 ) (10.4 ) (13.7 ) (165.3 ) Balance, December 31, 2006 18.8 257.6 45.1 157.7 Less: Current portion (18.8 ) (29.0 ) (13.0 ) (50.7 ) Long term portion $ $ 228.6 $ 32.1 $ 107.0 Final Capping, Allowance for Closure and Doubtful Accounts Post Closure Remediation Self Insurance Balance, December 31, 2004 $ 18.0 $ 216.8 $ 54.0 $ 143.8 Non cash asset additions 20.4 Revisions in estimates of future cash flows recorded as non cash asset additions (8.1 ) Accretion expense 14.5 Other additions charged to expense 6.5 .1 160.8 Acquisitions, net of divestitures .1 3.3 Payments or usage (7.3 ) (7.4 ) (3.8 ) (146.0 ) Balance, December 31, 2005 17.3 239.5 50.3 158.6 Less: Current portion (17.3 ) (27.0 ) (3.1 ) (57.5 ) Long term portion $ $ 212.5 $ 47.2 $ 101.1 41 Table of Contents Final Capping, Allowance for Closure and Doubtful Accounts Post Closure Remediation Self Insurance Balance, December 31, 2003 $ 19.0 $ 204.7 $ 54.7 $ 122.2 Non cash asset additions 19.6 Revisions in estimates of future cash flows recorded as non cash asset additions (4.3 ) Accretion expense 13.7 Other additions charged to expense 8.0 1.7 165.3 Acquisitions .6 Payments or usage (9.0 ) (17.5 ) (2.4 ) (143.7 ) Balance, December 31, 2004 18.0 216.8 54.0 143.8 Less: Current portion (18.0 ) (14.6 ) (2.7 ) (47.4 ) Long term portion $ $ 202.2 $ 51.3 $ 96.4 Our expense related to doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was .3%, .2% and .3%, respectively. As of December 31, 2006, accounts receivable were $293.8 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $18.8 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of 34, or 22 days net of deferred revenue. In addition, at December 31, 2006, our accounts receivable in excess of 90 days old totaled $20.1 million, or 6.4% of gross receivables outstanding. Our expense for self insurance, which includes risk insurance and health insurance for all of our employees, as a percentage of revenue for 2006, 2005 and 2004 was 5.4%, 5.6% and 6.1%, respectively. The decrease in self insurance expense during the years presented is due to favorable claims development. We believe that, during 2007, our self insurance expense will be in the range of 5.0% to 5.5% of revenue.

Cash Flows From Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $522.1 million, $767.5 million and $666.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The changes in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are primarily due to the expansion of our business, the timing of payments received for accounts receivable, and the timing of payments for accounts payable. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we paid approximately $83.0 million in income taxes related to fiscal 2005. This tax payment had been deferred as a result of an Internal Revenue Service notice issued in response to Hurricane Katrina. In December 2003, we received written approval from the Internal Revenue Service to exclude probable expansion airspace from our calculation of landfill amortization, depletion, and final capping, closure and post closure expense for tax purposes. As a result of this change, we recorded a tax receivable of approximately $48.0 million which was collected or used to offset taxes payable during the year ended December 31, 2004. Also during the year ended December 31, 2004, we collected a $23.0 million note receivable associated with a divested business. We use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividend payments and debt repayments. Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities was $215.4 million, $297.2 million and $206.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and consists primarily of cash used for capital additions for all periods presented, cash provided by restricted cash in 2006, cash provided by restricted marketable securities in 2005 and 2004, and cash provided by the disposition of our operations in western New York in 2005. Capital additions were $337.6 million, $328.7 million and $283.8 million during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Cash used to acquire businesses, net of cash acquired, was $4.9 million, $26.7 million and $47.3 million during the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Proceeds provided by the liquidation of certain marketable securities during 2004 were used to repay $225.0 million of public notes. We used letters of credit to replace financial guarantees secured by marketable securities that were liquidated. We intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand, restricted cash held for capital expenditures, cash flow from operations, our revolving credit facility, tax exempt bonds and other financings. We expect to use primarily cash for future business acquisitions. Cash Flows Used In Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities was $409.4 million, $480.0 million and $437.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, and consists primarily of purchases of common stock for treasury, proceeds from and payments of notes payable and long term debt, proceeds from stock option exercises and payments of cash dividends. Purchases of common stock for treasury were $492.0 million, $558.4 million and $266.1 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Dividends paid were $78.5 million, $72.2 million and $46.0 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. In 2004, repayments of debt include the liquidation of $225.0 million of public notes. 44 Table of Contents From 2000 through 2006, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2,050.0 million of our common stock. As of December 31, 2006, we paid $1,800.8 million to repurchase 63.7 million shares of our common stock, of which $492.0 million was paid during 2006 to repurchase 12.2 million shares of our common stock. We used proceeds from our cash on hand, liquidation of marketable securities, cash flow from operations, and issuances of tax exempt bonds to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions and to repay debt. We intend to finance future stock repurchases and dividend payments through cash on hand, cash flow from operations, our revolving credit facility and other financings. Credit Rating Our company has received investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2006, our senior debt was rated BBB+ by Standard & Poors, BBB+ by Fitch and Baa2 by Moodys. Fuel Hedges During September 2006, we entered into option agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), the options qualified for and were designated as effective hedges in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases. These option agreements commenced on October 2, 2006 and settle each month in equal notional amounts of 500,000 gallons through December 31, 2007. In accordance with SFAS 133, the effective portion of the change in fair value as of December 31, 2006, net of tax, has been recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value was not material and has been recorded in other income (expense), net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. During October 2005, we entered into option agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases. The option agreements commenced on January 1, 2006 and settled each month in equal notional amounts through December 31, 2006. In accordance with SFAS 133, the effective portion of the change in fair value as of December 31, 2005, net of tax, has been recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value was not material and has been recorded in other income (expense), net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. During March 2005, we entered into option agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases. The option agreements settled each month in equal notional amounts through December 31, 2005. The ineffective portion of the change in fair value was not material and was included in other income (expense), net in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Income. During January 2007, we entered into option agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases. These options commence in January 2008 and settle each month in equal notional amounts of 500,000 gallons through December 2010. 45 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2006 (in millions): Maturities of Notes Payable and Other Final Capping, Unconditional Year Ending Operating Capital Long Term Closure and Purchase December 31, Leases Leases (a) Debt (b) Post Closure (c) Remediation Commitments (d) Total 2007 $ 5.0 $ 4.3 $ 86.3 $ 29.0 $ 13.0 $ 18.2 $ 155.8 2008 3.3 4.3 85.8 32.2 6.8 13.0 145.4 2009 2.5 4.3 181.5 23.1 .8 11.1 223.3 2010 1.7 4.3 123.6 22.5 .8 2.2 155.1 2011 1.0 4.3 526.1 19.7 .7 2.1 553.9 Thereafter 4.1 69.9 1,823.5 281.3 23.0 11.3 2,213.1 Total $ 17.6 $ 91.4 $ 2,826.8 $ 407.8 $ 45.1 $ 57.9 $ 3,446.6 (a) The present value of these obligations is included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. (b) Amounts include interest payments at the stated rate for fixed rate debt or at the applicable rate as of December 31, 2006 for variable rate debt. (c) The estimated remaining final capping, closure and post closure expenditures presented above are uninflated and undiscounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of December 31, 2006. (d) Unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of long term disposal agreements that require us to dispose of a minimum number of tons at third party facilities. In addition to the above, we have letters of credit totaling $638.4 million outstanding at December 31, 2006. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have or engage in any off balance sheet arrangements. 46 Table of Contents Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement. Our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates in the United States and fluctuations in LIBOR. We intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. All items described below are non trading. Expected Maturity Date Fair Value (Asset)/Liability December 31, 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total 2006 FIXED RATE DEBT: Amount outstanding (in millions) $ 2.6 $ 2.2 $ 101.5 $ 2.4 $ 452.4 $ 567.7 $ 1,128.8 $ 1,104.4 Average interest rates 6.0 % 5.4 % 7.1 % 5.4 % 6.7 % 5.4 % 6.1 % VARIABLE RATE DEBT: Amount outstanding (in millions) $ $ $ $ 45.0 $ $ 407.6 $ 452.6 $ 452.6 Average interest rates 5.6 % 4.1 % 4.3 % INTEREST RATE SWAPS: Fixed to variable notional amount (in millions) $ $ $ $ $ 210.0 $ $ 210.0 $ 6.0 Average pay rate 7.9 % 7.9 % Average receive rate 6.75 % 6.75 % The fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable and, thus, approximates current market rates. Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Our free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is calculated as follows (in millions): 2006 2005 2004 Cash provided by operating activities $ 522.1 $ 767.5 $ 666.3 Purchases of property and equipment (337.6 ) (328.7 ) (283.8 ) Proceeds from sales of property and equipment 18.5 10.1 5.7 Free cash flow $ 203.0 $ 448.9 $ 388.2 Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively affected by an $83.0 million federal tax payment that had been deferred until February 2006 as a result of an Internal Revenue Service notice issued in response to Hurricane Katrina. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2005 was higher than the other years presented primarily because of a $113.4 million federal tax payment that was deferred. During February 2006, we paid $83.0 million of these deferred taxes. We believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in 47 Table of Contents our customer base and services provided, pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment our existing business platform, repurchasing shares of common stock at prices that provide value to our stockholders, paying cash dividends, maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt. In addition, free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation. The presentation of free cash flow has material limitations. Free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Seasonality and Severe Weather Our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding compensation), delay the collection and disposal of waste, reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites, or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities. New Accounting Pronouncements In July 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes (the Interpretation). The Interpretation applies to all tax positions within the scope of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and applies a more likely than not threshold for tax benefit recognition, identifies a defined methodology for measuring benefits and increases the disclosure requirements for companies. The Interpretation is mandatory for years beginning after December 15, 2006; accordingly, we will adopt the Interpretation effective January 1, 2007. The cumulative effect of adopting the Interpretation will be recorded in retained earnings and other accounts as applicable. We are currently in the process of evaluating the effects of this new accounting standard. We do not believe that the adoption of the Interpretation will have a material impact on our financial statements. In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value, and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 will be effective for our Company beginning January 1, 2008. We are currently in the process of assessing the provisions of SFAS 157 and determining how this framework for measuring fair value will affect our current accounting policies and procedures and our financial statements. We do not believe that the adoption of SFAS 157 will have a material impact on our financial statements. There are no other new accounting pronouncements that are significant to our Company. ITEM 7A.
