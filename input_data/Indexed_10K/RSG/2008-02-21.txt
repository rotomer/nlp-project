ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and their Notes contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K. Overview of Our Business We are a leading provider of non hazardous solid waste collection and disposal services in the United States. We provide solid waste collection services for commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers through 136 collection companies in 21 states. We also own or operate 94 transfer stations, 58 solid waste landfills and 33 recycling facilities. We generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations. Our remaining revenue is from other services including landfill disposal, recycling, compost, mulch and soil operations. The following table reflects our revenue by source for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Collection: Residential $ 802.1 25.3 % $ 758.3 24.7 % $ 705.3 24.6 % Commercial 944.4 29.7 883.6 28.8 801.5 28.0 Industrial 645.6 20.3 654.1 21.3 601.0 21.0 Other 19.5 .6 22.4 .7 31.3 1.1 Total collection 2,411.6 75.9 2,318.4 75.5 2,139.1 74.7 Transfer and disposal 1,192.5 1,182.1 1,108.6 Less: Intercompany (612.3 ) (588.6 ) (560.1 ) Transfer and disposal, net 580.2 18.3 593.5 19.3 548.5 19.1 Other 184.4 5.8 158.7 5.2 176.3 6.2 Revenue $ 3,176.2 100.0 % $ 3,070.6 100.0 % $ 2,863.9 100.0 % Our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers. Our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on long term contracts with municipalities. We generally provide industrial and commercial collection services to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years. Our revenue from landfill operations is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties. In general, we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials. No one customer has individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years. The cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes disposal, labor, self insurance, fuel and equipment maintenance costs. It also includes capital costs for equipment and facilities. We seek operating efficiencies by controlling the movement of waste from the point of collection through disposal. During the three months ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, approximately 58% and 56%, respectively, of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate. Our landfill costs include daily operating expenses, costs of capital for cell development, costs for final capping, closure and post closure, and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance. Daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal, methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance, interim cap maintenance, and costs associated with the application of daily cover materials. We expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred. We use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to cell development. In life cycle accounting, certain direct costs are capitalized, and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards 22 Table of Contents of available airspace. These costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems, installation of groundwater monitoring wells, and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site. Obligations associated with final capping, closure and post closure are capitalized, and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed. Cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers. These estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to adjust our rates used to expense capitalized costs. Changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs, available airspace, inflation and applicable regulations. Changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates, changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted. Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the respective years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is shown in the following table: Depreciation, Amortization, Depletion and SFAS 143 Depreciation, Accretion Before Adjustments to Amortization, Operating Net SFAS 143 Amortization Depletion and Income Operating 2007 Revenue Adjustments Expense(a) Accretion (Loss) Margin Eastern Region $ 577.0 $ 50.6 $ 1.0 $ 51.6 $ 66.1 11.5 % Central Region 647.5 88.0 (6.0 ) 82.0 119.9 18.5 Southern Region 828.8 72.8 .4 73.2 180.2 21.7 Southwestern Region 349.0 34.5 .4 34.9 61.3 17.6 Western Region 773.2 66.2 7.5 73.7 172.6 22.3 Corporate Entities .7 7.2 7.2 (64.1 ) Total $ 3,176.2 $ 319.3 $ 3.3 $ 322.6 $ 536.0 16.9 Depreciation, Amortization, Depletion and SFAS 143 Depreciation, Accretion Before Adjustments to Amortization, Operating Net SFAS 143 Amortization Depletion and Income Operating 2006 Revenue Adjustments Expense(a) Accretion (Loss) Margin Eastern Region $ 568.8 $ 44.6 $ (.9 ) $ 43.7 $ 92.4 16.2 % Central Region 635.1 92.6 (1.9 ) 90.7 111.4 17.5 Southern Region 798.1 73.8 1.5 75.3 153.6 19.2 Southwestern Region 334.3 35.4 (.8 ) 34.6 58.5 17.5 Western Region 735.8 61.8 (.2 ) 61.6 171.1 23.3 Corporate Entities (1.5 ) 5.8 5.8 (67.5 ) Total $ 3,070.6 $ 314.0 $ (2.3 ) $ 311.7 $ 519.5 16.9 Depreciation, Amortization, Depletion and SFAS 143 Depreciation, Accretion Before Adjustments to Amortization, Operating Net SFAS 143 Amortization Depletion and Income Operating 2005 Revenue Adjustments Expense(a) Accretion (Loss) Margin Eastern Region $ 543.7 $ 45.3 $ (.7 ) $ 44.6 $ 92.2 17.0 % Central Region 567.8 81.3 .9 82.2 103.5 18.2 Southern Region 734.7 74.0 (.4 ) 73.6 121.4 16.5 Southwestern Region 320.8 33.5 (4.2 ) 29.3 50.9 15.9 Western Region 693.9 58.8 .6 59.4 163.9 23.6 Corporate Entities 3.0 4.2 4.2 (54.7 ) Total $ 2,863.9 $ 297.1 $ (3.8 ) $ 293.3 $ 477.2 16.7 (a) Consists of adjustments to amortization expense for changes in estimates and assumptions related to our reviews of landfill asset retirement obligations under SFAS 143. 23 Table of Contents Our operations are managed and reviewed through five regions that we designate as our reportable segments. From 2005 to 2007, revenue increased in all of our regions due to the successful execution of our pricing strategy. 2007 compared to 2006: Revenue in our Eastern Region increased during 2007 compared to 2006 due to price increases in all lines of business and an increase in the price of commodities. This increase in revenue was partially offset by lower volumes in the industrial collection line of business primarily due to less temporary work, and lower landfill volumes. These lower volumes resulted from less favorable weather conditions and a general slowdown in residential construction during 2007. Operating margins in the Eastern Region decreased from 16.2% to 11.5% primarily because of a $44.6 million charge to operating expenses and a $1.5 million charge to selling, general and administrative expenses associated with environmental conditions at our Countywide Recycling and Disposal Facility in East Sparta, Ohio. Excluding these expenses, operating margins increased from 16.2% in 2006 to 19.4% in 2007, primarily due to higher revenue, lower disposal costs, and lower truck and equipment maintenance costs. Revenue in our Central Region increased during 2007 compared to 2006 due to price increases in all lines of business and an increase in the price of commodities. This increase in revenue was partially offset by lower volumes in the commercial collection, industrial collection and landfill lines of business. Lower volumes in the collection lines of business are primarily due to less favorable weather conditions during 2007 and a general slowdown in economic conditions. Lower landfill volumes are primarily due to our decision to limit our acceptance of certain waste streams. Operating margins in our Central Region increased due to higher revenue, lower disposal costs and adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with SFAS 143. This increase in operating margins was partially offset by increases in risk insurance and landfill operating costs. In our Southern Region, price increases in all lines of business, increases in the price of commodities, and increases in commercial collection, residential collection and landfill volumes resulted in an increase in revenue during 2007 compared to 2006. This increase in revenue was partially offset by lower industrial collection volumes. These lower volumes are primarily due to a general slowdown in residential construction in 2007, and hurricane related work that was performed during 2006. Operating margins in our Southern Region increased primarily due to higher revenue, lower disposal costs due to drier weather, lower truck and equipment maintenance costs, and lower labor costs. Our Southwestern Region benefited from price increases in all lines of business and volume increases in the commercial collection, industrial collection and landfill lines of business. This increase in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in residential collection volumes. This decrease in residential collection volumes is primarily due to the city of Houston assuming responsibility for collecting municipal solid waste. The increase in operating margins in our Southwestern Region is primarily due to higher revenue and lower selling, general and administrative costs. This increase in operating margins was partially offset by higher disposal and truck maintenance costs. In our Western Region, price increases in all lines of business, volume increases in the residential collection line of business and an increase in commodity prices resulted in an increase in revenue during 2007 compared to 2006. This increase in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in industrial collection and landfill volumes resulting from a general slowdown in residential construction in 2007. Operating margins in our Western Region decreased because of an $8.1 million increase in landfill operating costs and a $5.2 million increase in SFAS 143 amortization expense associated with environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in Contra Costa County, California. Excluding these expenses, operating margins increased from 23.3% in 2006 to 24.0% in 2007, primarily due to higher revenue and an increase in the price of commodities. 24 Table of Contents The decrease in operating costs for Corporate Entities from 2006 to 2007 is due to a $4.3 million reduction to our allowance for doubtful accounts recorded during 2007 as a result of refining our estimate of our allowance based on our historical collection experience, which was partially offset by increases in operating costs associated with the expansion of our business. 2006 compared to 2005: Revenue in our Eastern Region increased during 2006 compared to 2005 due to price increases in our collection and landfill lines of business and due to increased volumes in our industrial collection and landfill businesses. This increase in revenue was partially offset by decreased volume in our commercial and residential collection businesses and by the sale of our operations in western New York during the three months ended March 31, 2005. Operating margins decreased from 2005 to 2006 due to higher landfill operating and fuel costs partially offset by higher revenue. In our Central Region, revenue increased during 2006 compared to 2005 due to price increases in our collection and landfill lines of business and volume growth in our landfill line of business arising from favorable economic conditions. Operating margins decreased primarily due to increased third party hauling costs associated with our company assuming responsibility for hauling waste from the city of Toronto to one of our landfills in Michigan. This increase in costs was partially offset by adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with SFAS 143. Our operations in the Southern Region experienced the greatest margin improvement of all of our segments because of price increases and volume growth in our collection and landfill lines of business. Operating margins increased because of an increase in revenue arising from favorable economic conditions, partially offset by higher fuel costs and adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with SFAS 143. Operating margins also improved during 2006 because of higher costs incurred during the fourth quarter of 2005 related to hurricane clean up. In our Southwestern Region, revenue increased due to price increases and volume growth in our collection and landfill lines of business, partially offset by the sale of our remediation and heavy construction services business during the fourth quarter of 2005. The increase in operating margins from 2005 to 2006 is attributable to an increase in revenue arising from improving economic conditions, partially offset by higher fuel costs and adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with SFAS 143. In our Western Region, revenue increased due to price increases and volume growth in our collection and landfill lines of business. Operating margins decreased from 2005 to 2006 because of higher fuel, labor and insurance costs, partially offset by an increase in revenue during 2006 and adjustments for landfill amortization expense associated with SFAS 143. The increase in operating costs for Corporate Entities from 2005 to 2006 is due to the expansion of our business, incremental costs associated with our adoption of SFAS 123(R), additional costs associated with our 401(k) plan resulting from an increase in the employers matching contribution percentage and an increase in other incentive compensation. 2007 Financial Objectives In February 2007, we publicly announced our objectives for the year. These objectives included the following: Generating free cash flow (a non GAAP measure) in excess of 100% of net income, or approximately $315 million. In July 2007, we increased our range of anticipated free cash flow to approximately $320 to $325 million. Using our free cash flow to repurchase our common stock under our existing $250.0 million share repurchase program and to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends. Generating diluted earnings per share of $1.50 to $1.52. We updated our earnings per share guidance in July 2007 to a new range of $1.59 to $1.62 per diluted share and in October 2007 to a new range of $1.65 to $1.66 25 Table of Contents per diluted share (excluding the $54.9 million of charges, or $.18 per diluted share, we recorded in 2007 related to our Countywide and Contra Costa County facilities). Growing revenue from core operations by approximately 4.0% to 4.5%, with approximately 3.0% to 3.5% attributable to price increases and 1% attributable to volume growth. In July 2007, we updated our core revenue growth guidance to approximately 3.0%, with approximately 4.5% attributable to price growth (excluding commodities), while volume was expected to decline approximately 1.5%. Purchasing approximately $310 million of property and equipment, net of sales of property and equipment. In July 2007, we reduced this to $295 million. 2007 Business Performance During 2007, we met or exceeded our financial objectives. During 2007, we generated free cash flow of $374.9 million (consisting of cash provided by operating activities of $661.3 million, less purchases of property and equipment of $292.5 million, plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment of $6.1 million). In July 2007, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional $250.0 million of our company stock. During 2007, we used our free cash flow to repurchase 11.1 million shares of our common stock, or 5.7% of our outstanding shares, for $362.8 million. Also, during the third quarter of 2007, our board of directors increased our quarterly dividend to $.17 per share. During 2007, we generated diluted earnings per share of $1.51. Excluding pre tax charges of $54.9 million ($33.8 million, or $0.18 per diluted share, net of tax) related to our Countywide and Contra Costa County facilities and a pre tax gain of $12.5 million ($5.0 million, or $0.03 per diluted share, net of tax) related to the sale of our compost, mulch and soil business in Texas, our diluted earnings per share would have been $1.66. Our internal growth from core operations for 2007, excluding commodities, divestitures, taxes and non core operations, was 3.1%, with 4.6% from price increases offset by a 1.5% decline in volume. During 2007, our revenue growth from core pricing continued to benefit from a broad based pricing initiative which we started during the fourth quarter of 2003. The broad based price increases we secured offset various escalating capital and operating costs, including fuel costs. During 2007, we experienced lower industrial collection and landfill volumes primarily resulting from the slowdown in residential construction. Excluding the $54.9 million of charges we recorded during 2007 related to our Countywide and Contra Costa County facilities, our operating margins increased by 1.7% from 16.9% in 2006 to 18.6% in 2007. During 2007, improved pricing and continued focus on productivity improvements offset higher fuel and insurance costs. 2008 Financial Objectives Our financial objectives for 2008 assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of 2007. Specific guidance is as follows: We expect to generate free cash flow in excess of net income, or approximately $340 to $350 million. We anticipate using our free cash flow to continue to repurchase shares of our common stock under our existing $250 million share repurchase program and a new $250.0 million repurchase program authorized by our board of directors in January 2008. We also anticipate using our free cash flow to continue to pay quarterly cash dividends. We anticipate diluted earnings of $1.78 to $1.82 per share. We anticipate operating margins of approximately 19.0%. 26 Table of Contents We are targeting internal growth from core operations to be approximately 2.0% to 3.5%, with approximately 3.5% to 4.0% attributable to core price increases, while the change in volume is expected to be down .5% to 1.5%. We anticipate purchasing approximately $325 million of property and equipment, net of sales of property and equipment. 2008 Business Initiatives Our business initiatives for 2008 are generally a continuation of those initiated in prior years and are dependent on further standardizing our business processes and improving our systems. Ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and processes and are trained on our systems is essential to the overall success of our initiatives. Our business initiatives for 2008 are as follows: Pricing initiatives. During the fourth quarter of 2003, we implemented a broad based pricing initiative across all lines of our business. The purpose of this initiative is to recover increasing costs and improve operating margins. We realized the benefit of this initiative during the past several years and expect a continuing benefit during 2008. Improve business integration. During 2005, we took a number of steps to further strengthen our business platform and improve our business integration. In response to limited vertical integration opportunities, we divested of our operations in western New York. We acquired a landfill in the Dallas/Fort Worth area which better integrated that marketplace. In addition, we divested of our remediation and heavy construction services business. During 2007, we divested of our Texas based compost, mulch and soil business. We plan to continue to develop and implement strategies that improve the performance of locations and lines of business that are performing below the companys average. To achieve this objective, we may purchase operations from, sell operations to or exchange operations with other companies in the future. Improve the quality of our revenue. During 2006, we completed the development of the next generation of our billing and operating system. This system standardizes our billing and operating processes. It also provides a variety of functionalities including customer service, dispatch, billing, sales analysis, account retention and route productivity analysis. During 2008, we will continue to ensure that our operating personnel are utilizing the system to its full potential. We currently monitor our return on investment by marketplace and use a return on investment pricing model. This model will eventually allow us to track our return on investment by customer. We use a customer relationship management system. This system improves the productivity of our sales force by helping to establish marketing priorities and track sales leads. It also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial, industrial and franchise contracts. During 2008, we will continue to ensure our sales force is properly trained on this system and is using it as intended. Improve the productivity of our operations. We use a grid productivity program that enables us to benchmark the performance of our drivers. In addition, in our larger markets, we use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and improve operational density. During 2008, we will continue to update our disposal optimization metrics. These metrics identify which local disposal option maximizes our return on invested capital and cash flow. Improve fleet management and procurement. We use Dossier as our fleet management and parts procurement system at all of our significant hauling and landfill operations. Among other features, this system tracks parts inventories, generates automatic quantity order points and logs all maintenance work. It allows us to capture and review information to ensure our preventive maintenance programs comply with manufacturers warranties and governmental regulations. In addition, the purchase order module within this system allows us to cross reference purchasing information with our inventory. During 2008, we intend to further utilize this purchase order module to take advantage of volume discounts. Enhance operational and financial reporting systems. We have several initiatives aimed at improving our operational and financial reporting systems. The overall goal of these initiatives is to provide us with detailed 27 Table of Contents information, prepared in a consistent manner, that will allow us to quickly analyze and act upon trends in our business. One of our most significant systems is our enterprise wide general ledger package, which includes Lawson general ledger software and Lawson fixed asset software. During December 2006, we successfully converted all of our locations to Lawson enterprise wide human resources software. This software provides a number of direct benefits including a reduction in payroll processing and compliance costs and integration into our general ledger software. It also provides a number of indirect benefits including better information concerning labor and related costs and better control over employee related initiatives such as training. All of the system initiatives mentioned above provide us with more consistent and detailed information, thus allowing us to make quicker and more informed business decisions. In addition, all of our significant software applications are standardized and centralized at our data center in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. This standardization and centralization provides us with consolidated information concerning our operations across a variety of operational and financial disciplines. It also significantly enhances our ability to execute our disaster recovery plan. Expand our safety training programs. In light of increasing insurance costs and as part of our ongoing emphasis on safe work practices, we continue to expand our safety training programs. Safety will continue to be a key area of focus during 2008. Customer First program. In order to secure our position as a leading provider of world class customer service, we have initiated a Customer First program. Several of our divisions were selected to implement this program during 2008. This program entails establishing sustainable and competitive service standards in each applicable marketplace. Systems to measure our success in meeting our service level standards will also be developed. Best practices derived from the program will be implemented throughout our company. 28 Table of Contents Critical Accounting Policies, Judgments and Disclosures Our Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared using U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management. The following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our companys financial position, results of operations and cash flows, and may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain: Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Landfill Accounting: Life Cycle Accounting We use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain landfill costs over the life of the site. In life cycle accounting, all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized, and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. Obligations associated with final capping, closure and post closure are capitalized, and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed. Cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers. Changes in these estimates could significantly affect our amortization, depletion and accretion expense. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Landfill and Environmental Matters. Note 3, Landfill and Environmental Costs in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Probable Expansion Airspace We include expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood that the expansion area will ultimately be permitted in our calculation of total available airspace. We have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace. We believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted. However, because some of these criteria are judgmental, they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted. In either of these scenarios, our amortization, depletion and accretion expense could change significantly. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Landfill and Environmental Matters.Note 3, Landfill and Environmental Costs in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 29 Table of Contents Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Final Capping, Closure and Post Closure We account for our final capping, closure and post closure activities in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations. Under SFAS 143, obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event. Obligations related to closure and post closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill. Landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units of consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill, depending on the nature of the obligation. All obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value. Fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and the companys credit adjusted, risk free rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred. Future costs for final capping, closure and post closure are developed at least annually by engineers, and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections. Changes in any of these estimates could affect our amortization of final capping, closure and post closure costs and our accretion expense.

Note 3, Landfill and Environmental Costs in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 30 Table of Contents Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Self Insurance: Our insurance programs for workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured. Self insurance accruals are based on claims reported and actuarial estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported. Estimates of claims development and claims incurred but not reported are developed actuarially. If actual claims experience or development is significantly different than our estimates, our self insurance expense would change. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Selected Balance Sheet Accounts. Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Property and Equipment: Expenditures for Improvements, Repairs and Maintenance Expenditures for major additions and improvements to facilities are capitalized. All expenditures for maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred. Whether certain expenditures improve an asset or lengthen its useful life is subject to our judgment. Accordingly, the actual useful lives of our assets could differ from our estimates. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Property and Equipment.Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts: Accounts receivable, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts, represents their estimated net realizable value. Provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded based on historical collection experience, the age of the receivables, specific customer information and economic conditions. In general, reserves are provided for accounts receivable in excess of 90 days old. Accounts receivable are written off when they are deemed uncollectible. Establishing reserves against specific accounts receivable and the overall adequacy of our accounts receivable reserve is a matter of judgment. If our judgments and estimates concerning the adequacy of our reserve for accounts receivable is incorrect, bad debt expense would change. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Selected Balance Sheet Accounts. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies in the Consolidated Financial Statements. 31 Table of Contents Subjective or Disclosure Policy Description Complex Judgments Reference Income Taxes: Deferred Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes. Accordingly, deferred taxes have been provided to show the effect of temporary differences between the recognition of revenue and expenses for financial and income tax reporting purposes and between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements. After the initial recognition of a deferred tax asset, a valuation allowance is provided if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and the realizability of net operating losses for tax purposes are based on our judgment. If our judgments and estimates concerning valuation allowances and the realizability of net operating losses are incorrect, our provision for income taxes would change. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 6, Income Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Uncertain Tax Positions Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes. The interpretation identifies a defined methodology for recognizing uncertain tax positions. Evaluating and estimating our uncertain tax positions and tax benefits is based on our judgment. If our judgments and estimates are incorrect, our provision for income taxes would change. Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 6, Income Taxes in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Business Combinations We make decisions to acquire, invest in or divest of businesses based on financial and strategic considerations. Businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our Consolidated Financial Statements from the date of acquisition. We acquired various solid waste businesses during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. The aggregate purchase price we paid for these transactions was $4.4 million, $4.9 million and $26.7 million, respectively. In addition, during 2005, we entered into a $53.9 million capital lease related to a landfill. In November 2007, we divested of our Texas based compost, mulch and soil business and received proceeds of $36.5 million. A gain of $12.5 million was recorded in 2007 on this divestiture. In 2005, we divested of our operations in western New York and received proceeds of $29.1 million. A gain of $3.3 million was recorded in 32 Table of Contents 2005 on the divestiture. In addition, in 2005, we sold our environmental remediation company and received proceeds of $1.2 million. A loss of $2.0 million was recorded in 2005 on the divestiture. Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) for 2007 acquisitions totaled $1.0 million. As of December 31, 2007 we had goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,555.7 million. Goodwill for 2006 acquisitions totaled $1.0 million. As of December 31, 2006, we had goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,562.9 million. Goodwill for 2005 acquisitions totaled $16.6 million. As of December 31, 2005, we had goodwill, net of accumulated amortization, of $1,563.8 million. $57.9 million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions (including the landfill capital lease) and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace during 2005. When a landfill is acquired as part of a group of assets, purchase price is allocated to airspace based on the discounted expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within the acquired group and is adjusted for other landfill assets and liabilities acquired (which are primarily for final capping, closure and post closure obligations). Landfill purchase price is amortized using the units of consumption method over total available airspace, which includes probable expansion airspace where appropriate. Consolidated Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 Our net income was $290.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2007, or $1.51 per diluted share, as compared to $279.6 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, in 2006 and $253.7 million, or $1.20 per diluted share, in 2005. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded pre tax charges of $45.3 million ($27.9 million, or $.15 per diluted share, net of tax) related to estimated costs that we believe are required to comply with Final Findings and Orders issued by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency in response to environmental conditions at our Countywide Recycling and Disposal Facility in East Sparta, Ohio and to undertake certain other remedial actions we have agreed with the OEPA to perform, including, without limitation, installing a fire break and removing liquids from gas extraction wells. While we intend to vigorously pursue financial contributions from third parties for our costs to comply with the FOs and the additional remedial actions, we have not recorded any receivables for potential recoveries. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a pre tax charge of $9.6 million ($5.9 million, or $.03 per diluted share, net of tax) associated with an increase in estimated leachate disposal costs and costs to upgrade onsite equipment that captures and treats leachate at our closed disposal facility in Contra Costa County, California. These additional costs are attributable to a consent agreement with the California Department of Toxic Substance Control. The charges for our Countywide and Contra Costa County facilities affected our Consolidated Statements of Income as follows: Year Ended December 31, 2007 Expenses: Cost of operations $ 49.1 Depreciation, amortization and depletion 3.6 Selling, general and administrative 1.5 Operating income (54.2 ) Other income (expense), net (.7 ) Income before income taxes $ (54.9 ) 33 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a net tax benefit of $4.8 million in our provision for income taxes related to the resolution of various tax matters, including the effective completion of Internal Revenue Service audits of our consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 2001 through 2004. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes a $5.1 million benefit related to the resolution of various income tax matters, including the effective completion of Internal Revenue Service audits for the years 1998 through 2000. We adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment, effective January 1, 2006 using the modified prospective transition method. As a result of adopting SFAS 123(R), we recorded $6.3 million and $5.5 million of incremental equity based compensation expense during the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. In accordance with the modified prospective transition method, our Consolidated Financial Statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect, and do not include, the impact of adopting SFAS 123(R). See Note 8, Employee Benefit Plans, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. The following table summarizes our operating costs and expenses in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Revenue $ 3,176.2 100.0 % $ 3,070.6 100.0 % $ 2,863.9 100.0 % Cost of operations 1,997.3 62.9 1,924.4 62.7 1,803.9 63.0 Depreciation, amortization and depletion of property and equipment 299.0 9.4 289.0 9.4 271.7 9.5 Amortization of intangible assets 6.5 .2 7.0 .2 7.1 .2 Accretion 17.1 .5 15.7 .5 14.5 .5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 320.3 10.1 315.0 10.3 289.5 10.1 Operating income $ 536.0 16.9 % $ 519.5 16.9 % $ 477.2 16.7 % Revenue. Revenue was $3,176.2 million, $3,070.6 million and $2,863.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Revenue increased by $105.6 million, or 3.4%, from 2006 to 2007. Revenue increased by $206.7 million, or 7.2%, from 2005 to 2006. The following table reflects the components of our revenue growth for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Core price 4.2 % 3.4 % 2.7 % Fuel surcharges .2 1.1 .8 Environmental fees .2 .4 .2 Recycling commodities .9 (.1 ) .1 Total price 5.5 4.8 3.8 Core volume(a) (1.5 ) 2.4 2.5 Non core volume (.1 ) (.2 ) Total volume (1.6 ) 2.4 2.3 Total internal growth 3.9 7.2 6.1 Acquisitions, net of divestitures (.5 ) (.1 ) (.4 ) Taxes(b) .1 .1 Total revenue growth 3.4 % 7.2 % 5.8 % 34 Table of Contents (a) Core volume growth for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes .8% associated with hauling waste from the city of Toronto to one of our landfills in Michigan. This hauling service is provided to the city at a rate that approximates our cost. (b) Represents new taxes levied on landfill volumes in certain states that are passed on to customers. 2007: During the year ended December 31, 2007, our revenue growth from core pricing continued to benefit from a broad based pricing initiative which we started during the fourth quarter of 2003. Our revenue growth also benefited from higher prices for commodities. However, we experienced a decrease in core volume growth primarily due to lower industrial collection and landfill volumes resulting from the slowdown in residential construction. 2006: During the year ended December 31, 2006, our revenue growth continued to benefit from our broad based pricing initiative. We experienced core volume growth in our collection and landfill lines of business. This core volume growth was partially offset by hurricane clean up efforts that took place during the fourth quarter of 2005. 2005: During the year ended December 31, 2005, our revenue growth from core pricing continued to benefit from our broad based pricing initiative. During the year ended December 31, 2005, we experienced core volume growth in our residential collection, industrial collection and landfill businesses. Our core volume growth was also positively impacted by hurricane clean up efforts. In June 2005, we began assessing environmental fees on the non franchise portion of our customer base. 2008 Outlook: We anticipate internal growth from core operations to be approximately 2.0% to 3.5% during 2008, with approximately 3.5% to 4.0% attributable to core price increases, while the change in volume is expected to be down .5% to 1.5%. Our projections assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of 2007. However, our internal growth may remain flat or may decline in 2008 depending on economic conditions and our success in implementing pricing initiatives. Cost of Operations. Cost of operations was $1,997.3 million, $1,924.4 million and $1,803.9 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 62.9%, 62.7% and 63.0%, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in cost of operations in aggregate dollars for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is primarily a result of the $41.0 million of charges we have recorded in cost of operations related to estimated costs to comply with Final Findings and Orders issued by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and to undertake certain other remedial actions in response to environmental conditions at our Countywide facility and the $8.1 million charge we recorded related to an increase in leachate disposal costs and costs to upgrade onsite equipment that captures and treats leachate at our closed disposal facility in Contra Costa County, California. The increase in aggregate dollars for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus the comparable 2005 period is primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through internal growth. The following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Subcontractor, disposal and third party fees $ 699.6 22.0 % $ 718.7 23.4 % $ 694.9 24.3 % Labor and benefits 614.4 19.3 588.5 19.2 557.3 19.5 Maintenance and operating 510.0 16.1 457.3 14.9 401.2 14.0 Insurance and other 173.3 5.5 159.9 5.2 150.5 5.2 Total $ 1,997.3 62.9 % $ 1,924.4 62.7 % $ 1,803.9 63.0 % 35 Table of Contents A description of our cost categories is as follows: Subcontractor, disposal and third party fees include costs such as third party disposal, transportation of waste, host fees and cost of goods sold. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for all periods presented is primarily due to higher revenue resulting from improved pricing. During 2007, drier weather, particularly in our Southern Region, resulted in lower disposal costs. In addition, the decrease in expense as a percentage of revenue from 2005 to 2006 is due to costs incurred during the fourth quarter of 2005 related to hurricane clean up. These reductions in costs were partially offset by additional third party hauling costs incurred during 2006 associated with our company assuming responsibility for hauling waste from the city of Toronto to one of our landfills in Michigan. Labor and benefits include costs such as wages, salaries, payroll taxes and health benefits for our frontline service employees and their supervisors. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is due to increases in benefits including health insurance. In addition, during December 2006, we assumed responsibility for hauling a portion of our transfer station volumes to one of our landfills. This hauling service reduced our third party fees and increased various other cost categories, the most significant of which is labor. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus the comparable 2005 period is primarily due to higher revenue resulting from improved pricing and productivity improvements in our commercial and industrial collection lines of business. Maintenance and operating includes costs such as fuel, parts, shop labor and benefits, third party repairs, and landfill monitoring and operating. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is primarily due to an increase in landfill operating costs resulting from $41.0 million of charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2007 for our Countywide facility. These charges related to increases in estimated costs to comply with Final Findings and Orders issued by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and to undertake certain other remedial actions in response to environmental conditions. In addition, landfill operating costs increased due to an $8.1 million charge associated with an increase in estimated leachate disposal costs and costs to upgrade onsite equipment that captures and treats leachate at our closed disposal facility in Contra Costa County, California. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus the comparable 2005 period is primarily due to increases in fuel and landfill operating costs. The cost of fuel as a percentage of revenue increased by .3% from 2006 to 2007 and by .6% from 2005 to 2006. Insurance and other includes costs such as workers compensation, auto and general liability insurance, property taxes, property maintenance and utilities. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is primarily due to an increase in the severity of our automobile insurance claims. The cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies. As such, care should be taken when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies. Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion of Property and Equipment. Depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were $299.0 million, $289.0 million and $271.7 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 9.4%, 9.4% and 9.5%, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is partially due to $3.3 million of adjustments to landfill amortization expense for changes in estimates and assumptions related to our reviews of landfill asset retirement obligations under SFAS 143. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred approximately $3.3 million of additional depletion and amortization expense associated with a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our Countywide facility. Depreciation expense during 2007 was also slightly higher due to our ongoing truck and equipment replacement program. The slight decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue during the year ended December 31, 2006 versus the comparable 2005 period is due to lower landfill amortization and depletion expense during 2006. 36 Table of Contents Amortization of Intangible Assets. Intangible assets consist primarily of costs in excess of fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill), but also includes values assigned to long term contracts, covenants not to compete and customer relationships. Expenses for amortization of intangible assets were $6.5 million, $7.0 million and $7.1 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, .2% for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Accretion Expense. Accretion expense was $17.1 million, $15.7 million and $14.5 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, .5% for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increases in such expenses in aggregate dollars in 2007 and 2006 is primarily due to increases in asset retirement obligations. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $320.3 million, $315.0 million and $289.5 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 10.1%, 10.3% and 10.1%, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is primarily due to the expansion of our business. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for 2007 versus 2006 is primarily due to a reduction in incentive compensation costs and a $4.3 million reduction to our allowance for doubtful accounts recorded during the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of refining our estimate for our allowance based on our historical collection experience. The increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue from 2005 to 2006 is due to incremental costs associated with our adoption of SFAS 123(R), additional costs associated with our 401(k) plan resulting from an increase in the employers matching contribution percentage and an increase in other incentive compensation. During the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, we incurred $6.3 million and $5.5 million, respectively, of incremental costs associated with our adoption of SFAS 123(R). We believe that selling, general and administrative expenses for 2008 will be approximately 10.0% to 10.5% of revenue. Operating Income. Operating income was $536.0 million, $519.5 million and $477.2 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 16.9%, 16.9% and 16.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest Expense. We incurred interest expense primarily on our unsecured notes and tax exempt bonds. Interest expense was $94.8 million, $95.8 million and $81.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus the comparable 2005 period is primarily due to an increase in debt balances and an increase in interest rates on our floating rate debt. Capitalized interest was $3.0 million, $2.7 million and $2.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Interest Income and Other Income (Expense), Net. Interest income and other income, net of other expense, was $26.9 million, $20.0 million and $13.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The increase in aggregate dollars for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is due to a $12.5 million gain related to the sale of our compost, mulch and soil business in Texas partially offset by lower interest income on cash and restricted cash balances. The increase in aggregate dollars for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus the comparable 2005 period is primarily due to an increase in interest income on cash and restricted cash balances resulting from higher interest rates. Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes was $177.9 million, $164.1 million and $155.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Our effective income tax rate was 38.0%, 37.0% and 38.0% for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a net tax benefit of $4.8 million in our provision for income taxes related to the resolution of various income tax matters, including the effective completion of Internal Revenue Service audits of our consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 2001 through 2004. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes a $5.1 million benefit related to the resolution of various income tax matters, including the effective 37 Table of Contents completion of Internal Revenue Service audits for the years 1998 through 2000. We believe that our effective income tax rate for 2008 will be approximately 38.5%. Landfill and Environmental Matters Available Airspace The following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: Landfill Balance as of New Operating Permits Changes in Changes Balance as of December 31, Expansions Contracts, Granted, Airspace Engineering in December 31, 2006 Undertaken Net Net of Closures Consumed Estimates Design 2007 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,597.2 .2 1.2 (40.3 ) 6.9 (27.9 ) 1,537.3 Number of sites 59 (1 ) 58 Probable expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 124.6 74.4 .5 (7.5 ) 192.0 Number of sites 8 3 11 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,721.8 74.4 .2 1.2 (40.3 ) 7.4 (35.4 ) 1,729.3 Number of sites 59 (1 ) 58 Balance as of Permits Changes in Balance as of December 31, Granted, Airspace Engineering December 31, 2005 Net of Closures Consumed Estimates 2006 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,577.7 56.6 (43.5 ) 6.4 1,597.2 Number of sites 59 59 Probable expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 177.7 (52.5 ) (.6 ) 124.6 Number of sites 9 (1 ) 8 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,755.4 4.1 (43.5 ) 5.8 1,721.8 Number of sites 59 59 Landfills Balance as of New Acquired Permits Changes in Changes Balance as of December 31, Expansions or Divested, Granted, Airspace Engineering in December 31, 2004 Undertaken Net Net of Closures Consumed Estimates Design 2005 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,529.6 17.9 64.8 (43.6 ) 7.4 1.6 1,577.7 Number of sites 58 1 59 Probable expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 222.2 8.3 (52.7 ) (.3 ) .2 177.7 Number of sites 12 1 (4 ) 9 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,751.8 8.3 17.9 12.1 (43.6 ) 7.1 1.8 1,755.4 Number of sites 58 1 59 Changes in engineering estimates typically include minor modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information. Changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfills footprint or vertical slopes. At December 31, 2004, 12.7% of our total available airspace, or 222.2 million cubic yards, consisted of probable expansion airspace at twelve of our landfills. At December 31, 2007, 11.1% of our total available airspace, or 192.0 million cubic yards, consisted of probable expansion airspace at eleven of our landfills. Between 38 Table of Contents December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2007, we received permits for five of our probable expansions, which demonstrates our continued success in obtaining permits for expansion airspace. During 2007, total available airspace increased by a net 7.5 million cubic yards due to new expansions undertaken, changes in engineering estimates and permits granted, partially offset by airspace consumed and changes in design. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2007, total available airspace was increased as a result of obtaining a new contract to operate a landfill in Texas, which was substantially offset by a reduction resulting from not renewing a contract to operate a small landfill in Texas. Changes in design in 2007 are primarily due to a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our Countywide facility. During 2006, total available airspace decreased by 33.6 million cubic yards due to airspace consumption, partially offset by permits granted and changes in engineering estimates. During 2005, total available airspace increased by 3.6 million cubic yards primarily due to new expansions undertaken, the acquisition of a landfill, permits granted and changes in engineering estimates, partially offset by airspace consumed. As of December 31, 2007, we owned or operated 58 solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 1.7 billion in place cubic yards. Total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace. These estimates are developed at least annually by engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys. As of December 31, 2007, total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 1.5 billion in place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus .2 billion in place cubic yards of probable expansion airspace. Before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and, therefore, included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity, it must meet all of our expansion criteria. See Note 3, Landfill and Environmental Costs, of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. As of December 31, 2007, eleven of our landfills meet all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity. At projected annual volumes, these eleven landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 30 years, including probable expansion airspace. The average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 27 years. Probable expansion airspace represents 11.1% of our total available airspace. We have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for probable expansion airspace. The following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of December 31, 2007: Number of Sites without Number of Sites with Total Percent Expansion Airspace Expansion Airspace Sites of Total 0 to 5 years 3 1 4 6.8 % 6 to 10 years 11 11 19.0 11 to 20 years 13 2 15 25.9 21 to 40 years 11 6 17 29.3 41+ years 9 2 11 19.0 Total 47 11 58 100.0 % Sites with expansion airspace include two landfills with less than five years of remaining permitted airspace. Final Capping, Closure and Post Closure Costs As of December 31, 2007, accrued final capping, closure and post closure costs were $277.7 million. The current portion of these costs of $32.6 million is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in other current liabilities. The long term portion of these costs of $245.1 million is reflected in our Consolidated Balance Sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs. Remediation and Other Charges for Landfill Matters During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded pre tax charges of $45.3 million related to estimated costs to comply with Final Findings and Orders issued by the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency and to 39 Table of Contents undertake certain other remedial actions in response to environmental conditions at our Countywide facility. We have complied with and will continue to comply with the FOs. We also recorded $3.3 million of additional depletion and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2007 associated with a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at this landfill as a result of the OEPAs FOs. While we intend to vigorously pursue financial contributions from third parties for our costs to comply with the FOs and the additional remedial actions, we have not recorded any receivables for potential recoveries. Also during the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a charge of $9.6 million associated with an increase in estimated leachate disposal costs and costs to upgrade onsite equipment that captures and treats leachate at our closed disposal facility in Contra Costa County, California. These additional costs are attributable to a consent agreement with the California Department of Toxic Substance Control. We accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated. We accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities associated with acquisitions of properties through business combinations as a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace, as appropriate. Investment in Landfills The following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 and the future expected investment as of December 31, 2007 (in millions): Non Cash Additions SFAS 143 Balance as of Landfill for Asset Adjustments to Additions Transfers Balance as of December 31, Capital Retire Operating Retirement Amortization Charged to and Other December 31, 2006 Additions ments Contracts Obligations Expense Expense Adjustments 2007 Non depletable landfill land $ 52.7 $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 52.7 Landfill development costs 1,722.2 .9 (2.5 ) 2.5 19.5 (.7 ) 78.8 1,820.7 Construction in progress landfill 61.1 95.9 (90.6 ) 66.4 Accumulated depletion and amortization (930.6 ) 2.3 (1.1 ) (110.1 ) (1,039.5 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 905.4 $ 96.8 $ (.2 ) $ 2.5 $ 19.5 $ (1.8 ) $ (110.1 ) $ (11.8 ) $ 900.3 Balance as of Expected Total December 31, Future Expected 2007 Investment Investment Non depletable landfill land $ 52.7 $ $ 52.7 Landfill development costs 1,820.7 1,744.8 3,565.5 Construction in progress landfill 66.4 66.4 Accumulated depletion and amortization (1,039.5 ) (1,039.5 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 900.3 $ 1,744.8 $ 2,645.1 Non Cash Additions SFAS 143 Balance as of for Asset Adjustments to Additions Transfers Balance as of December 31, Capital Retire Retirement Amortization Charged to and Other December 31, 2005 Additions ments Obligations Expense Expense Adjustments 2006 Non depletable landfill land $ 51.6 $ 1.1 $ $ $ $ $ $ 52.7 Landfill development costs 1,630.0 1.6 (7.0 ) 22.8 (10.3 ) 85.1 1,722.2 Construction in progress landfill 55.8 90.1 (84.8 ) 61.1 Accumulated depletion and amortization (829.3 ) 7.0 .3 (108.1 ) (.5 ) (930.6 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 908.1 $ 92.8 $ $ 22.8 $ (10.0 ) $ (108.1 ) $ (.2 ) $ 905.4 40 Table of Contents Non Cash Additions SFAS 143 Balance as of for Asset Adjustments to Additions Transfers Balance as of December 31, Capital Retire Landfill Retirement Amortization Charged to and Other December 31, 2004 Additions ments Acquisitions Obligations Expense Expense Adjustments 2005 Non depletable landfill land $ 53.4 $ .4 $ $ $ $ $ $ (2.2 ) $ 51.6 Landfill development costs 1,486.5 24.3 (5.5 ) 59.7 20.4 (28.7 ) 73.3 1,630.0 Construction in progress landfill 39.1 83.7 (67.0 ) 55.8 Accumulated depletion and amortization (742.9 ) (2.8 ) 20.6 (104.2 ) (829.3 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 836.1 $ 108.4 $ (5.5 ) $ 56.9 $ 20.4 $ (8.1 ) $ (104.2 ) $ 4.1 $ 908.1 The following table reflects our net investment in our landfills, excluding non depletable land, and our depletion, amortization and accretion expense for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005: Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Number of landfills owned or operated 58 59 59 Net investment, excluding non depletable land (in millions) $ 847.6 $ 852.7 $ 856.5 Total estimated available disposal capacity (in millions of cubic yards) 1,729.3 1,721.8 1,755.4 Net investment per cubic yard $ .49 $ .50 $ .49 Landfill depletion and amortization expense (in millions) $ 110.1 $ 108.1 $ 104.2 Accretion expense (in millions) 17.1 15.7 14.5 127.2 123.8 118.7 Airspace consumed (in millions of cubic yards) 40.3 43.5 43.6 Depletion, amortization and accretion expense per cubic yard of airspace consumed $ 3.16 $ 2.85 $ 2.72 The increase in depletion, amortization and accretion expense per cubic yard of airspace consumed from 2006 to 2007 is partially due to an increase of $3.3 million in landfill amortization expense that we recorded during the year ended December 31, 2007 related to reviews of landfill asset retirement obligations at our landfills. This increase is also partially due to $3.3 million of additional depletion and amortization expense we have recorded during the year ended December 31, 2007 associated with a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our Countywide facility. During the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, our weighted average compaction rate was approximately 1,500 pounds per cubic yard based on our three year historical moving average. Our compaction rates may improve as a result of the settlement and decomposition of waste. As of December 31, 2007, we expect to spend an estimated additional $1.7 billion on existing landfills, primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures, over their expected remaining lives. Our total expected investment, excluding non depletable land, estimated to be $2.6 billion, or $1.50 per cubic yard, is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the units of consumption method. Financial Condition At December 31, 2007 we had $21.8 million of cash and cash equivalents. We also had $165.0 million of restricted cash deposits, including $71.4 million of restricted cash held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities. In June 2005, we entered into a $750.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks which was scheduled to expire in 2010. This facility replaced our prior facilities which aggregated $750.0 million. In April 41 Table of Contents 2007, we increased our unsecured revolving credit facility to $1.0 billion and extended the term to 2012. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at LIBOR based rates. We use our operating cash flow and proceeds from our credit facilities to finance our working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, stock repurchases, dividends and other requirements. As of December 31, 2007, we had $538.6 million available under our credit facility. In May 1999, we sold $375.0 million of unsecured notes in the public market. These notes bear interest at 7.125% per annum and mature in 2009. Interest on these notes is payable semi annually in May and November. The notes were offered at a discount of $.5 million. In March 2005, we exchanged $275.7 million of our outstanding 7.125% notes due 2009 for new notes due 2035. The new notes bear interest at 6.086%. We paid a premium of $27.6 million related to the exchange. This premium is being amortized over the life of the new notes using the effective yield method. In August 2001, we sold $450.0 million of unsecured notes in the public market. The notes bear interest at 6.75% and mature in 2011. Interest on these notes is payable semi annually in February and August. The notes were offered at a discount of $2.6 million. In order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates and to take advantage of favorable floating interest rates, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment grade rated financial institutions. Our outstanding swap agreements have a total notional value of $210.0 million and require our company to pay interest at floating rates based on changes in LIBOR and receive interest at a fixed rate of 6.75%. Our swap agreements mature in August 2011. At December 31, 2007, we had $731.9 million of tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings outstanding of which $58.5 million were obtained during fiscal 2007. Borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on fixed or floating interest rates at the prevailing market ranging from 3.25% to 5.63% at December 31, 2007 and have maturities ranging from 2012 to 2037. As of December 31, 2007, we had $71.4 million of restricted cash related to proceeds from tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings. This restricted cash will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements. In March 2005, we entered into a $53.9 million capital lease related to a landfill. We believe that our excess cash, cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facility provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due. We believe that we will be able to raise additional debt or equity financing, if necessary. 42 Table of Contents Selected Balance Sheet Accounts The following tables reflect the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts, final capping, closure, post closure and remediation liabilities and accrued self insurance during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 (in millions): Final Capping, Allowance for Closure and Doubtful Accounts Post Closure Remediation Self Insurance Balance, December 31, 2006 $ 18.8 $ 257.6 $ 45.1 $ 157.7 Non cash asset additions 19.5 Revisions in estimates of future cash flows recorded as non cash asset additions (1.8 ) Accretion expense 17.1 Other additions charged to expense, net of adjustments 3.9 51.4 188.2 Divestitures (.2 ) Payments or usage (7.8 ) (14.7 ) (29.0 ) (167.9 ) Balance, December 31, 2007 14.7 277.7 67.5 178.0 Less: Current portion (14.7 ) (32.6 ) (33.4 ) (59.5 ) Long term portion $ $ 245.1 $ 34.1 $ 118.5 Final Capping, Allowance for Closure and Doubtful Accounts Post Closure Remediation Self Insurance Balance, December 31, 2005 $ 17.3 $ 239.5 $ 50.3 $ 158.6 Non cash asset additions 22.8 Revisions in estimates of future cash flows recorded as non cash asset additions (10.0 ) Accretion expense 15.7 Other additions charged to expense 8.4 8.5 164.4 Payments or usage (6.9 ) (10.4 ) (13.7 ) (165.3 ) Balance, December 31, 2006 18.8 257.6 45.1 157.7 Less: Current portion (18.8 ) (29.0 ) (13.0 ) (50.7 ) Long term portion $ $ 228.6 $ 32.1 $ 107.0 43 Table of Contents Final Capping, Allowance for Closure and Doubtful Accounts Post Closure Remediation Self Insurance Balance, December 31, 2004 $ 18.0 $ 216.8 $ 54.0 $ 143.8 Non cash asset additions 20.4 Revisions in estimates of future cash flows recorded as non cash asset additions (8.1 ) Accretion expense 14.5 Other additions charged to expense 6.5 .1 160.8 Acquisitions, net of divestitures .1 3.3 Payments or usage (7.3 ) (7.4 ) (3.8 ) (146.0 ) Balance, December 31, 2005 17.3 239.5 50.3 158.6 Less: Current portion (17.3 ) (27.0 ) (3.1 ) (57.5 ) Long term portion $ $ 212.5 $ 47.2 $ 101.1 Our expense related to doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was .1%, .3% and .2%, respectively. The reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts during the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the comparable periods presented is due to an adjustment we recorded in 2007 of $4.3 million as a result of refining our estimate for our allowance based on our historical collection experience. As of December 31, 2007, accounts receivable were $298.2 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $14.7 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of 34, or 20 days net of deferred revenue. At December 31, 2007, our accounts receivable in excess of 90 days old totaled $19.5 million, or 6.2% of gross receivables outstanding. Our expense for self insurance, which includes risk insurance and health insurance for all of our employees, as a percentage of revenue for 2007, 2006 and 2005 was 5.9%, 5.4% and 5.6%, respectively. The increase in self insurance expense for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is primarily due to an increase in the severity of our automobile insurance claims. The decrease in self insurance expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 versus the comparable 2005 period is due to favorable claims development. We believe that, during 2008, our self insurance expense will be in the range of 5.5% to 6.0% of revenue.

Cash Flows From Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $661.3 million, $511.2 million and $747.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The changes in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are primarily due to the expansion of our business, the timing of payments received for accounts receivable, and the timing of payments made for accounts payable. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we paid approximately $83.0 million in income taxes related to fiscal 2005. This tax payment had been deferred as a result of an Internal Revenue Service notice issued in response to Hurricane Katrina. We use cash flows from operations to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, share repurchases, dividend payments and debt repayments. Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities was $260.3 million, $204.5 million and $277.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and consists primarily of cash used for capital additions for all periods presented, cash provided by a decrease in restricted cash in 2006, cash provided by a decrease in restricted marketable securities in 2005, cash provided by the disposition of our compost, mulch and soil business in Texas in 2007, and cash provided by the disposition of our operations in western New York in 2005. Capital additions were $292.5 million, $326.7 million and $309.0 million during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Cash used to acquire businesses, net of cash acquired, was $4.4 million, $4.9 million and $26.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand, restricted cash held for capital expenditures, cash flows from operations, our revolving credit facility, tax exempt bonds and other financings. We expect to use primarily cash for future business acquisitions. Cash Flows Used In Financing Activities. Cash used in financing activities was $408.3 million, $409.4 million and $480.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, and consists primarily of purchases of common stock for treasury, proceeds from and payments of notes payable and long term debt, proceeds from issuances of common stock due to stock option exercises and payments of cash dividends. Purchases of common stock for treasury were $362.8 million, $492.0 million and $558.4 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Dividends paid were $93.9 million, $78.5 million and $72.2 million during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. From 2000 through 2007, our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.3 billion of our common stock. As of December 31, 2007, we paid $2.2 billion to repurchase 74.8 million shares of our common stock, of which $362.8 million was paid during 2007 to repurchase 11.1 million shares of our common stock. In January 2007, our board of directors approved a 3 for 2 stock split in the form of a stock dividend, effective on March 16, 2007, to stockholders of record as of March 5, 2007. We distributed approximately 64.5 million shares from treasury stock to effect the stock split. We used proceeds from our cash on hand, liquidation of marketable securities, cash flows from operations, and issuances of tax exempt bonds to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions and to repay debt. We intend to finance 46 Table of Contents future stock repurchases and dividend payments through cash on hand, cash flows from operations, our revolving credit facility and other financings. Credit Rating Our company has received investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2007, our senior debt was rated BBB+ by Standard Poors, BBB+ by Fitch and Baa1 by Moodys. Fuel Hedges During November 2007, we entered into an option agreement related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases. Under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), the option qualified for and was designated as an effective hedge of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases.

(d) Unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of long term disposal agreements that require us to dispose of a minimum number of tons at third party facilities. In addition to the above, we have unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2007 of $23.2 million of which we expect to settle approximately $.6 million within the following twelve months. Due to the uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the remainder of the unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2007, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of any cash settlements. We also have letters of credit totaling $669.1 million outstanding at December 31, 2007. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have or engage in any off balance sheet arrangements. 48 Table of Contents Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement. Our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates in the United States and fluctuations in LIBOR. We intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. All items described below are non trading. Expected Maturity Date Fair Value (Asset)/Liability as of December 31, 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total 2007 FIXED RATE DEBT: Amount outstanding (in millions) $ 2.3 $ 101.6 $ 2.3 $ 452.4 $ 27.6 $ 501.4 $ 1,087.6 $ 1,131.9 Average interest rates 5.5 % 7.1 % 5.5 % 6.7 % 5.0 % 5.6 % 6.2 % VARIABLE RATE DEBT: Amount outstanding (in millions) $ $ $ $ $ $ 504.9 $ 504.9 $ 504.9 Average interest rates 3.8 % 3.8 % INTEREST RATE SWAPS: Fixed to variable notional amount (in millions) $ $ $ $ 210.0 $ $ $ 210.0 $ (3.1 ) Average pay rate 7.0 % 7.0 % Average receive rate 6.75 % 6.75 % The fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value, since interest rates are variable and, thus, approximate current market rates. Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Our free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is calculated as follows (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Cash provided by operating activities $ 661.3 $ 511.2 $ 747.8 Purchases of property and equipment (292.5 ) (326.7 ) (309.0 ) Proceeds from sales of property and equipment 6.1 18.5 10.1 Free cash flow $ 374.9 $ 203.0 $ 448.9 Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2007 was higher than anticipated due to lower than expected purchases of property and equipment, higher deferred income taxes and lower payments for asset retirement obligations. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively affected by an $83.0 million federal tax payment that had been deferred until February 2006 as a result of an Internal Revenue Service notice issued in response to Hurricane Katrina. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2005 was higher than the other years presented primarily because of a $113.4 million federal tax payment that was deferred. During February 2006, we paid $83.0 million of these deferred payments. Purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and as presented in the free cash flow above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and equipment reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows to property 49 Table of Contents and equipment received during the period for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005 is as follows (in millions): Years Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Purchases of property and equipment presented in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows $ 292.5 $ 326.7 $ 309.0 Adjustment for property and equipment received during the prior period but paid for in the following period, net 3.2 10.9 19.7 Property and equipment received during the current period $ 295.7 $ 337.6 $ 328.7 The adjustments noted above do not affect either our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows or our free cash flow. We believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided, pursuing strategic acquisitions that augment our existing business platform, repurchasing shares of common stock at prices that provide value to our stockholders, paying cash dividends, maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt. In addition, free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation. The presentation of free cash flow has material limitations. Free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Seasonality and Severe Weather Our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement or severe weather which could increase the volume of waste collected under our existing contracts (without corresponding compensation), delay the collection and disposal of waste, reduce the volume of waste delivered to our disposal sites, or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities. New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 will be effective beginning January 1, 2008. We do not believe that the adoption of SFAS 157 will have a material impact on our financial statements. In February 2007, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159), which permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. This statement also establishes presentation and disclosure requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between companies that choose different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities. SFAS 159 will be effective for our company beginning January 1, 2008. At the effective date, a company may elect the fair value option for eligible items that exist at that date. The company would report the initial effect of any remeasurement to fair value as a cumulative effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings for the fiscal year in which this statement is initially applied. Upfront costs and fees related to items for which the fair value option is elected would be recognized in earnings as incurred and not deferred. Subsequent unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected would be reported in earnings. We do not believe that SFAS 159 will have a material impact on our financial statements. There are no other new accounting pronouncements that are significant to us. 50 Table of Contents ITEM 7A.
