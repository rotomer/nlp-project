ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, included elsewhere herein. This discussion may contain forward looking statements that anticipate results based on managements plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in Item 1A. Risk Factors. Overview of Our Business As of December 31, 2008, we are the second largest provider of services in the domestic non hazardous solid waste industry. We provide non hazardous solid waste collection services for commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers through 400 collection companies in 40 states and Puerto Rico. We also own or operate 242 transfer stations, 213 active solid waste landfills and 78 recycling facilities. In early 2008, we began to experience the impact of the economic slowdown on our operations. This slowdown intensified during 2008 which, combined with a tightening of the credit markets, resulted in unprecedented changes in the U.S. and global economies. Against this backdrop, consumption in the U.S. slowed dramatically. New housing construction, a primary driver of our temporary industrial collection business, declined in excess of 40% compared to 2007. More recently we are seeing a slowdown in commercial construction. A slowdown in manufacturing has resulted in a decrease in our permanent industrial collection business. Furthermore, volumes in our commercial collection business began to decline in the second half of 2008 as consumers decreased discretionary spending. We are also beginning to see lower commercial volumes due to store closures and increased commercial vacancies. Fuel prices, which reached historic highs in the summer, dropped quickly in the fall of 2008. This decrease in fuel prices was offset by corresponding declines in fuel surcharges and, therefore, did not significantly improve our profitability. In addition, prices for recycling commodities declined in response to a decline in global demand. Although we hedged a portion of our commodity sales, declines in commodity prices have had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our profitability. Despite the challenging economic environment, our business performed well during 2008 due in large part to the indispensible nature of our services and the scalability of our business. Our internal revenue growth during 2008 was 2.5%. Increases in core price and fuel recovery fees offset volume declines. This increase in price and fuel recovery fees, together with cost control steps taken by our operations management to scale the business down for lower volumes, also served to moderate profit margin declines associated with rising costs and declining revenue due to decreases in service volumes. During December 2008, we completed our merger with Allied, forming the second largest waste management company in the U.S. We believe that this merger creates a strong operating platform that will allow us to continue to provide quality service to our customers and superior returns to our stockholders. We expect that the economic challenges we experienced during the latter part of 2008 will continue throughout 2009. We anticipate a decrease in volumes in all lines of our business. We also anticipate that prices for recycling commodities will remain depressed. However, we believe that we will benefit from our cost control and pricing initiatives. Ours is a capital intensive business. Slower growth allows us to reduce capital spending, thus maintaining strong free cash flow despite a weaker economy. In addition, we intend to focus our attention on integrating our newly merged company and achieving cost synergies as a result of the merger. Business Acquisitions and Divestitures We make decisions to acquire, invest in or divest of businesses based on financial and strategic considerations. Businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. 38 Table of Contents Merger with Allied Waste Industries, Inc. On June 22, 2008, Republic entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with Allied. Prior to the merger, Allied was the second largest provider of non hazardous solid waste collection, transfer, recycling and disposal services in the United States, as measured by revenue. The completion of the merger was subject to certain terms and conditions, including, but not limited to, approval of the transaction by the stockholders of both Republic and Allied, regulatory approval from the DOJ, and receipt of credit ratings for the combined company classifying our senior unsecured debt as investment grade. Having met those terms and conditions on December 5, 2008, we completed the merger. As of the effective date of the merger, each share of Allied common stock outstanding was converted into .45 shares of our common stock. We issued approximately 195.8 million shares of common stock to Allied stockholders in the merger. Allied stockholders received approximately 52% of the outstanding common stock of the combined company in respect of their Allied shares on a diluted basis as a result of the merger, and Republic stockholders retained approximately 48% of the outstanding common stock of the combined company on a diluted basis. The total purchase price paid for Allied, including the value of common stock issued (based on the average closing prices of Republics common stock for the five day period around June 23, 2008 (the announcement date)) totaled approximately $11.5 billion. Republic has been determined to be the acquiring company for accounting purposes in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 141, Business Combinations (SFAS 141). Therefore, we have accounted for the merger as an acquisition of Allied by Republic, using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with GAAP. Our consolidated financial statements include the operating results of Allied from the date of the acquisition, and have not been retroactively restated to include Allieds historical financial position or results of operations. In accordance with the purchase method of accounting, the purchase price paid has been allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based upon their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date, with the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired being recorded as goodwill. Republic is in the process of valuing all of the assets and liabilities acquired in the acquisition, and, until we have completed our valuation process, there may be adjustments to our estimates of fair values and the resulting preliminary purchase price allocation. Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) associated with the acquisition of Allied totaled $9.0 billion. In addition, when we acquire landfills as part of a group of assets, we allocate part of the purchase price to airspace based on the estimated fair value of the landfills relative to the fair value of other assets within the acquired group. We allocated $2.6 billion of the total purchase price paid for the acquisition of Allied to landfill airspace. Landfill purchase price is amortized using the units of consumption method over total available airspace, which includes probable expansion airspace where appropriate. As a condition of the merger with Allied, we reached a settlement with the DOJ requiring us to divest of assets serving fifteen metropolitan areas, including Los Angeles and San Francisco, CA; Denver, CO; Atlanta, GA; Northwestern Indiana; Lexington, KY; Flint, MI; Cape Girardeau, MO; Charlotte, NC; Cleveland, OH; Philadelphia, PA; Greenville Spartanburg, SC; and Fort Worth, Houston and Lubbock, TX. The settlement requires us to divest of 87 commercial waste collection routes, nine municipal solid waste landfills and ten transfer stations, together with ancillary assets and, in three cases, access to landfill disposal capacity. In February 2009, we entered into an agreement to divest certain assets to Waste Connections, Inc. The assets that are being divested under this agreement include six municipal solid waste landfills, six collection operations and three transfer stations across the following seven markets: Los Angeles, CA; Denver, CO; Houston, TX; Lubbock, TX; Greenville Spartanburg, SC; Charlotte, NC; and Flint, MI. The transaction with Waste Connections is subject to closing conditions regarding due diligence, regulatory approval and other customary matters. Closing is expected to occur in the second quarter of 2009. Combined revenue of the assets being sold is approximately $110.0 million. During December 2008, we incurred $82.7 million of restructuring charges associated with integrating our operations with Allied. These charges primarily consist of severance and other employee termination and relocation benefits and consulting fees paid to outside parties. 39 Table of Contents Other Business Acquisitions and Divestitures In addition to the acquisition of Allied in December 2008, we acquired various other solid waste businesses during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. The aggregate purchase price we paid for these transactions was $13.4 million, $4.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively. Cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired (goodwill) associated with these acquisitions during 2008, 2007 and 2006 totaled $2.2 million, $1.0 million and $1.0 million, respectively. In November 2007, we divested of our Texas based compost, mulch and soil business and received proceeds of $36.5 million. A gain of $12.5 million was recorded in 2007 on this divestiture. Revenue We generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations. Our remaining revenue is from other services including landfill disposal and recycling. The following table reflects our revenue by service line for the respective years ended December 31 (in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Collection Residential $ 966.0 26.2 % $ 802.1 25.3 % $ 758.3 24.7 % Commercial 1,161.4 31.5 944.4 29.7 883.6 28.8 Industrial 711.4 19.3 645.6 20.3 654.1 21.3 Other 23.2 .7 19.5 .6 22.4 .7 Total Collection 2,862.0 77.7 2,411.6 75.9 2,318.4 75.5 Transfer and disposal 1,343.4 1,192.5 1,182.1 Less: Intercompany (683.5 ) (612.3 ) (588.6 ) Transfer and disposal, net 659.9 17.9 580.2 18.3 593.5 19.3 Other 163.2 4.4 184.4 5.8 158.7 5.2 Revenue $ 3,685.1 100.0 % $ 3,176.2 100.0 % $ 3,070.6 100.0 % Our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers. Our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on long term contracts with municipalities. We generally provide industrial and commercial collection services to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years. Our revenue from landfill operations is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties. In general, we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials. No one customer has individually accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated revenue or of our reportable segment revenue in any of the last three years. The cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes disposal, labor, self insurance, fuel and equipment maintenance costs. It also includes capital costs for equipment and facilities. We seek operating efficiencies by controlling the movement of waste from the point of collection through disposal. During December 2008, subsequent to our acquisition of Allied, approximately 67% of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills that we own or operate. Our landfill costs include daily operating expenses, costs of capital for cell development, costs for final capping, closure and post closure, and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance. Daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal, methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance, interim cap maintenance, and costs associated with the application of daily cover materials. We expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred. We use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to cell development. In life cycle accounting, certain direct costs are capitalized, and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. These costs include all 40 Table of Contents costs to acquire and construct a site including excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems, installation of groundwater monitoring wells, and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site. Obligations associated with final capping, closure and post closure are capitalized, and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed. Cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers. These estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs. Changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs, available airspace, inflation and applicable regulations. Changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates, changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted. Summarized financial information concerning our reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is shown in the following table (in millions, except percentages): Depreciation, Amortization, Depletion and SFAS 143 Accretion Adjustments Depreciation, Before to Amortization, Operating Net SFAS 143 Amortization Depletion and Income Operating Revenue Adjustments Expense(1) Accretion (Loss) Margin 2008: Eastern $ 576.1 $ 48.1 $ 5.6 $ 53.7 $ (99.9 ) (17.3 )% Central 674.4 85.6 (.8 ) 84.8 119.5 17.7 Southern 840.2 75.0 (.5 ) 74.5 177.1 21.1 Western 1,130.6 104.3 (4.2 ) 100.1 203.6 18.0 Allied 463.7 56.4 56.4 29.8 6.4 Corporate entities(3) .1 8.0 .5 8.5 (146.9 ) Total $ 3,685.1 $ 377.4 $ .6 $ 378.0 $ 283.2 7.7 2007(2): Eastern $ 577.0 $ 50.6 $ 1.0 $ 51.6 $ 66.1 11.5 % Central 647.5 88.0 (6.0 ) 82.0 119.9 18.5 Southern 828.8 72.8 .4 73.2 180.2 21.7 Western 1,122.2 100.7 7.9 108.6 233.9 20.8 Corporate entities(3) .7 7.2 7.2 (64.1 ) Total $ 3,176.2 $ 319.3 $ 3.3 $ 322.6 $ 536.0 16.9 2006(2): Eastern $ 568.8 $ 44.6 $ (.9 ) $ 43.7 $ 92.4 16.2 % Central 635.1 92.6 (1.9 ) 90.7 111.4 17.5 Southern 798.1 73.8 1.5 75.3 153.6 19.2 Western 1,070.1 97.2 (1.0 ) 96.2 229.6 21.5 Corporate entities(3) (1.5 ) 5.8 5.8 (67.5 ) Total $ 3,070.6 $ 314.0 $ (2.3 ) $ 311.7 $ 519.5 16.9 (1) Consists of adjustments to amortization expense for changes in estimates and assumptions related to our reviews of landfill asset retirement obligations under SFAS No. 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations (SFAS 143). (2) Certain amounts for 2007 and 2006 have been reclassified to conform with the 2008 presentation. (3) Corporate functions include legal, tax, treasury, information technology, risk management, human resources, corporate accounts and other typical administrative functions. Our operations are managed and reviewed through four geographic regions that we designate as our reportable segments. We acquired Allied on December 5, 2008, and, due to the timing of the acquisition, management reviewed and we have presented Allied as a separate reportable segment in our 41 Table of Contents consolidated financial statements. In addition, during the first quarter of 2008, we consolidated our Southwestern operations into our Western Region and, accordingly, the historical operating results of our Southwestern operations have been consolidated into our Western Region. 2008 compared to 2007: Eastern Region. Revenue in our Eastern Region decreased during 2008 compared to 2007 due to a decrease in volumes in all lines of business and a decrease in the prices of commodities. The decrease in volume is primarily attributable to less temporary work and lower transfer station volumes due to less construction activity. Landfill volumes were also lower. This decrease in revenue was partially offset by price increases in all lines of business. The operating loss in 2008 includes remediation charges of $99.9 million related to estimated costs to comply with the FOs issued by the OEPA and the AOC issued by the EPA related to our Countywide facility and an impairment charge of $75.9 million related to the anticipated loss of permitted airspace at Countywide based upon recent negotiations with the OEPA and EPA. It also includes $11.0 million of settlement reserves for certain legal matters. Operating income for 2007 includes a $44.6 million charge to operating expenses associated with environmental conditions at Countywide. Central Region. Revenue increased during 2008 compared to 2007 due to price increases in all lines of business. This increase in revenue was partially offset by lower volumes in all lines of business and lower prices of commodities due to the economic slowdown. Operating margins decreased during 2008 compared to 2007 due to an adjustment to landfill amortization expense associated with SFAS 143 during 2007. Southern Region. Price increases in all lines of business resulted in an increase in revenue during 2008 compared to 2007. This increase in revenue was partially offset by volume declines in our industrial and commercial collection lines of business and at our landfills and transfer stations. Operating margins decreased during 2008 compared to 2007 due to higher fuel costs partially offset by higher revenue, lower disposal costs and lower insurance costs. Western Region. Price increases in all lines of business resulted in an increase in revenue during 2008 compared to 2007. This increase in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in industrial collection, residential collection, transfer station and landfill volumes resulting from the economic slowdown. This increase in revenue was also partially offset by lower prices of commodities and by the sale of our Texas based compost, mulch and soil business in November 2007. Operating income in 2008 includes a $34.0 million charge related to estimated costs to comply with a Consent Decree and Settlement Agreement signed with the EPA, the Bureau of Land Management and Clark County, Nevada related to the Sunrise Landfill. It also includes a $21.9 million charge recorded during 2008 associated with environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in Contra Costa County, California. Operating income in 2007 includes an $8.1 million increase in landfill operating costs and a $5.2 million increase in SFAS 143 amortization expense associated with environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in Contra Costa County, California. Allied. The operating results for Allied are included in the consolidated financial statements of Republic from the date of the acquisition of December 5, 2008. These results include $17.2 million of bad debt expense related to conforming Allieds calculation of allowance for doubtful accounts with ours and providing for specific bankruptcy exposures, $3.9 million of restructuring charges for severance and other employee termination benefits and $5.6 million of amortization expense associated with the intangible assets recorded as a result of our merger. 42 Table of Contents Corporate Entities. The increase in operating costs for the Corporate Entities includes professional fees, distributions under cash and equity award programs, and relocation, severance and other employee termination benefits related to our merger with Allied. 2007 compared to 2006: Eastern Region. Revenue increased during 2007 compared to 2006 due to price increases in all lines of business and an increase in the prices of commodities. This increase in revenue was partially offset by lower volumes in the industrial collection line of business primarily due to less temporary work, and lower landfill volumes. These lower volumes resulted from less favorable weather conditions and a general slowdown in residential construction during 2007. Operating margins decreased from 16.2% to 11.5% primarily because of a $44.6 million charge to operating income associated with environmental conditions at our Countywide facility. Central Region. Revenue increased during 2007 compared to 2006 due to price increases in all lines of business and an increase in the prices of commodities. This increase in revenue was partially offset by lower volumes in the commercial collection, industrial collection and landfill lines of business. Lower volumes in the collection lines of business are primarily due to less favorable weather conditions during 2007 and the economic slowdown. Lower landfill volumes are primarily due to our decision to limit our acceptance of certain waste streams. Operating margins increased due to higher revenue, lower disposal costs and adjustments to landfill amortization expense associated with SFAS 143. This increase in operating margins was partially offset by increases in risk insurance and landfill operating costs. Southern Region. Price increases in all lines of business, increases in the prices of commodities, and increases in commercial collection, residential collection and landfill volumes resulted in an increase in revenue during 2007 compared to 2006. This increase in revenue was partially offset by lower industrial collection volumes. These lower volumes are primarily due to a slowdown in residential construction in 2007, and hurricane related work that was performed during 2006. Operating margins increased primarily due to higher revenue, lower disposal costs due to drier weather, lower truck and equipment maintenance costs, and lower labor costs. Western Region. Price increases in all lines of business, volume increases in the residential collection line of business and increases in the prices of commodities resulted in an increase in revenue during 2007 compared to 2006. This increase in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in industrial collection and landfill volumes resulting from a general slowdown in residential construction in 2007. Operating margins decreased because of an $8.1 million increase in landfill operating costs and a $5.2 million increase in SFAS 143 amortization expense associated with environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in Contra Costa County, California. Corporate Entities. The decrease in operating costs from 2006 to 2007 is due to a $4.3 million reduction to our allowance for doubtful accounts recorded during 2007 as a result of refining our estimate of our allowance based on our historical collection experience, which was partially offset by increases in operating costs associated with the expansion of our business. 2008 Business Performance During 2008, our internal revenue growth was 2.5% with a 4.0% increase in core price offset by a 3.9% decrease in core volume. During 2008, we experienced lower volumes in all of our lines of business due to the economic slowdown. Revenue growth from fuel surcharges and environmental fees was 1.8% and .4%, respectively. In addition, our merger with Allied in December 2008 resulted in a 13.4% increase in revenue. 43 Table of Contents The cost of fuel increased significantly during the summer and fall of 2008. The economic slowdown helped to moderate fuel prices in the later part of the year. Fuel ended the year at levels consistent with those experienced during 2007. This decrease in fuel prices was offset by corresponding declines in fuel surcharges and, therefore, did not significantly improve our profitability. Also during 2008, prices for recycling commodities declined in response to a decline in global demand. Although we hedged a portion of our commodity sales, declines in commodity prices have had, and will continue to have, a significant impact on our profitability. 2009 Business Initiatives Our business initiatives for 2009 focus on the timely integration of our operations with Allieds, while remaining focused on the aspects of our operations that have made us successful. Our initiatives include: Safety. Safety remains our highest priority for all of our employees. Both Republic and Allied have long standing commitments to ensuring a safe working environment for our employees. Our commitment to safety is unwavering and is evident in our mission statement. We will continue to foster a safe work environment for our employees and the communities that we service. In addition, we will continue to reward our people for operating in a safe and conscientious manner. Service Delivery. We believe that our focus on service delivery differentiates us from others in the waste management industry. During 2009, we will continue to exceed our customers expectations through the consistent delivery of high quality service. We will also focus on increasing the efficiency of our service delivery. We believe that our attention to efficient delivery of high quality customer service will enhance customer retention. Pricing. We remain dedicated to effective pricing practices. Our commitment to competitive pricing helps ensure that fees charged to our customers are fair relative to the services they receive. Our focus on pricing also creates long term value for our company and our stockholders. Integration. Our merger with Allied provides us with a unique opportunity to integrate two successful operations and create a best in class waste management company. During 2009, we will be keenly focused on the seamless integration of our operations and cultures. Synergy Capture. During 2009, we will remain committed to achieving and surpassing our approximately $150.0 million synergy goal. We have already developed a detailed plan for realizing this goal which includes participation at all levels throughout the company from the drivers of our fleet of collection vehicles to our board of directors. This plan anticipates achieving $100.0 million of annual run rate integration synergies by the end of fiscal 2009. We expect to incur approximately $135.0 million and $55.0 million of one time costs directly attributable to achieving our synergy goal during 2009 and 2010, respectively. We believe that our synergy goal is achievable despite the economic slowdown. Return on Invested Capital. Enhancing our return on invested capital is the culmination of all our 2009 initiatives. We will maintain our focus on disciplined growth and investing in our business to ensure increasing capital returns and shareholder value. Consolidated Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 Our net income was $73.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2008, or $.37 per diluted share, compared to $290.2 million, or $1.51 per diluted share, in 2007 and $279.6 million, or $1.39 per diluted share, in 2006. In January 2007, our Board of Directors approved a 3 for 2 stock split in the form of a stock dividend, effective on March 16, 2007, to stockholders of record as of March 5, 2007. We distributed approximately 64.5 million shares from treasury stock to effect the stock split. Our shares, per share data and weighted average common and common equivalent shares outstanding have been retroactively adjusted for all periods to reflect the stock split. 44 Table of Contents During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a number of charges and other expenses that impacted our pre tax income, net income and diluted earnings per share. These items primarily consist of the following (in millions, except per share data): Diluted Pre Tax Earnings Income Net Income per Share Remediation and related charges(1) $ 156.8 $ 94.6 $ .48 Asset impairments(2) 89.8 54.1 .27 Restructuring charges(3) 82.7 49.9 .25 Landfill amortization expense(4) 2.8 1.7 .01 Intangible asset amortization expense(5) 5.6 3.4 .02 Bad debt expense(6) 19.6 11.8 .06 Legal settlement reserves(7) 24.3 14.7 .07 Synergy incentive plan(8) 2.9 1.7 .01 Non cash interest expense(9) 10.1 6.1 .03 Tax impact on non deductible items(10) 31.1 .16 (1) Remediation and related charges of $156.8 million during 2008 were attributable to changes to our estimates of costs incurred at our Countywide facility in Ohio and our closed disposal facility in Contra Costa County, California as well as the Sunrise Landfill in Nevada. (2) During 2008, asset impairments of $89.8 million primarily relate to our Countywide facility, our former corporate headquarters in Florida and expected losses on sales of Department of Justice required divestitures as a result of our merger with Allied. (3) During 2008, we incurred restructuring charges of $82.7 million, consisting primarily of severance and other employee termination and relocation benefits attributable to integrating our operations with Allied. (4) During 2008, we recorded $2.8 million of incremental landfill amortization expense as compared to the amortization expense Allied would have recorded for the same period. The increase in the landfill amortization expense is the result of conforming Allieds policies for estimating the costs and timing for capping, closure and post closure obligations to Republics. (5) During 2008, we recorded $5.6 million of intangible asset amortization expense related to the intangible assets we recorded in the purchase price allocation for the acquisition of Allied. (6) During 2008, we recorded bad debt expense of $14.2 million related to conforming Allieds methodology for recording the allowance for doubtful accounts for accounts receivable with our methodology and $5.4 million to provide for specific bankruptcy exposures. (7) During 2008, we incurred $24.3 million of settlement charges related to our estimates of the outcome of various legal matters. (8) During 2008, we recorded $2.9 million to accrue for the synergy incentive plan pro rata over the periods earned. (9) During 2008, we incurred $10.1 million of non cash interest expense primarily associated with amortizing the discount on the debt we acquired from Allied that was recorded at fair value in purchase accounting. (10) During 2008, our effective tax rate was impacted by several expenses associated with the merger that are not tax deductible. The following table summarizes our operating revenue, costs and expenses in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: 2008 2007 2006 Revenue $ 3,685.1 100.0 % $ 3,176.2 100.0 % $ 3,070.6 100.0 % Cost of operations 2,416.7 65.6 2,003.9 63.1 1,924.4 62.7 Depreciation, amortization and depletion of property and equipment 342.3 9.3 299.0 9.4 289.0 9.4 Amortization of intangible assets 11.8 .3 6.5 .2 7.0 .2 Accretion 23.9 .7 17.1 .5 15.7 .5 Selling, general and administrative expenses 434.7 11.8 313.7 9.9 315.0 10.3 Asset impairments 89.8 2.4 Restructuring charges 82.7 2.2 Operating income $ 283.2 7.7 % $ 536.0 16.9 % $ 519.5 16.9 % Revenue. Revenue was $3.7 billion, $3.2 billion and $3.1 billion for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Revenue increased $508.9 million, or 16.0%, from 2007 to 2008. Our acquisition of Allied in December 2008 contributed $463.7 million to this increase in revenue. Revenue 45 Table of Contents increased by $105.6 million, or 3.4%, from 2006 to 2007. The following table reflects the components of our revenue growth for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: 2008 2007 2006 Core price 4.0 % 4.2 % 3.4 % Fuel surcharges 1.8 .2 1.1 Environmental fees .4 .2 .4 Recycling commodities .1 .9 (.1 ) Total price 6.3 5.5 4.8 Core volume(1) (3.9 ) (1.5 ) 2.4 Non core volume .1 (.1 ) Total volume (3.8 ) (1.6 ) 2.4 Total internal growth 2.5 3.9 7.2 Acquisitions, net of divestitures(2) 13.4 (.5 ) (.1 ) Taxes(3) .1 .1 Total revenue growth 16.0 % 3.4 % 7.2 % (1) Core volume growth for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes .8% associated with hauling waste from the city of Toronto to one of our landfills in Michigan. This hauling service is provided to the city at a rate that approximates our cost. (2) Includes the impact of the acquisition of Allied in December 2008. (3) Represents new taxes levied on landfill volumes in certain states that are passed on to customers. 2008: During the year ended December 31, 2008, our core revenue growth continued to benefit from a broad based pricing initiative. In addition, 14.7% of our revenue growth is due to our acquisition of Allied in December 2008. Revenue growth also benefited from higher fuel surcharges and environmental fees. However, during 2008 we experienced lower prices for commodities. We also experienced a decrease in core volumes primarily due to lower commercial and industrial collection volumes and lower landfill volumes resulting from the slowdown in the economy. We expect to continue to experience lower volumes until economic conditions improve. 2007: During the year ended December 31, 2007, our revenue growth from core pricing continued to benefit from a broad based pricing initiative. Our revenue growth also benefited from higher prices for commodities. However, we experienced a decrease in core volume growth primarily due to lower industrial collection and landfill volumes resulting from the slowdown in residential construction. 2006: During the year ended December 31, 2006, our revenue growth continued to benefit from our broad based pricing initiative. We experienced core volume growth in our collection and landfill lines of business. This core volume growth was partially offset by hurricane clean up efforts that took place during the fourth quarter of 2005. 2009 Outlook: We anticipate internal revenue from core operations to decrease approximately 4.0% during 2009. This decrease is the expected net of growth in core pricing of approximately 4.0% and an expected decrease in volume of approximately 8.0%. Our projections assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of 2008. However, our internal growth may remain flat or may decline in 2009 depending on economic conditions and our success in implementing pricing initiatives. Cost of Operations. Cost of operations was $2.4 billion, $2.0 billion and $1.9 billion, or, as a percentage of revenue, 65.6%, 63.1% and 62.7%, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in cost of operations in aggregate dollars for the year ended December 31, 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is primarily a result of our acquisition of Allied in December 2008. The remaining increase in cost of operations in aggregate dollars and the increase as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to charges we recorded during 2008 of $98.0 million related to estimated costs to comply with FOs issued by the OEPA and the AOC issued by the EPA in response to environmental conditions at our Countywide facility in Ohio, $21.9 million related to environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility 46 Table of Contents in Contra Costa County, California and $34.0 million related to environmental conditions at the Sunrise Landfill. The increase in cost of operations and as a percentage of our revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is primarily a result of the $41.0 million charge we recorded in cost of operations related to environmental conditions at our Countywide facility and an $8.1 million charge related to our closed disposal facility in Contra Costa County, California. The following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue: 2008 2007 2006 Subcontractor, disposal and third party fees $ 770.6 20.9 % $ 699.6 22.0 % $ 718.7 23.4 % Labor and benefits 705.5 19.2 620.0 19.5 588.5 19.2 Maintenance and operating expenses 721.8 19.6 511.0 16.1 457.3 14.9 Insurance and other 218.8 5.9 173.3 5.5 159.9 5.2 Cost of operations $ 2,416.7 65.6 % $ 2,003.9 63.1 % $ 1,924.4 62.7 % A description of our cost categories is as follows: Subcontractor, disposal and third party fees include costs such as third party disposal, transportation of waste, host fees and cost of goods sold. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for all periods presented is primarily due to higher revenue resulting from improved pricing. In addition, the decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is also due to lower costs of goods sold associated with the sale of our lower margin, Texas based compost, mulch and soil business in November 2007. During 2007, drier weather, particularly in our Southern Region, resulted in lower disposal costs. The reduction in costs were partially offset by additional third party hauling costs incurred during 2006 associated with our assuming responsibility for hauling waste from the city of Toronto to one of our landfills in Michigan. Labor and benefits include costs such as wages, salaries, payroll taxes and health benefits for our frontline service employees and their supervisors. Such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period decreased due to higher revenue resulting from improved pricing and lower labor costs associated with volume decreases in various lines of business. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is due to increases in benefits including health insurance. In addition, during December 2006, we assumed responsibility for hauling a portion of our transfer station volumes to one of our landfills. This hauling service reduced our third party fees and increased various other cost categories, the most significant of which was labor. Maintenance and operating includes costs such as fuel, parts, shop labor and benefits, third party repairs, and landfill monitoring and operating. The increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is primarily a result of the $98.0 million charge related to the Countywide facility, the $21.9 million charge related to our closed disposal facility in California and the $34.0 million charge related to the Sunrise Landfill. This increase is partially offset by the $41.0 million of charges related to our Countywide facility and the $8.1 million charge related to our closed disposal facility in California recorded during 2007. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is primarily due to an increase in landfill operating costs resulting from the charges recorded during the year ended December 31, 2007 of $41.0 million related to our Countywide facility and $8.1 million charge related to our closed disposal facility in California. Excluding these charges in the respective periods, the decrease in expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the years ended December 31, 2008 and 2007 are primarily due to increases in fuel prices. Our average cost of fuel per gallon increased approximately 32% from $2.76 per gallon during 2007 to $3.63 per gallon during 2008, and increased approximately 7% from $2.59 per gallon during 2006 to $2.76 per gallon for 2007. Current average fuel prices are $2.12 per gallon. 47 Table of Contents Insurance and other includes costs such as workers compensation, auto and general liability insurance, property taxes, property maintenance and utilities. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for all of the years presented is primarily due to an increase in the severity of our automobile insurance claims. The cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies. As such, care should be taken when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies. Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion of Property and Equipment. Depreciation, amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were $342.3 million, $299.0 million and $289.0 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 9.3%, 9.4% and 9.4%, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars for the year ended December 31, 2008 versus the comparable 2007 is primarily due to our acquisition of Allied in December 2008. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is primarily due to a reduction of amortization expense associated with lower landfill volumes. The increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is partially due to $3.3 million of adjustments to landfill amortization expense for changes in estimates and assumptions related to our reviews of landfill asset retirement obligations under SFAS 143. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2007, we incurred approximately $3.3 million of additional depletion and amortization expense associated with a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our Countywide facility. Depreciation expense during 2007 was also slightly higher due to our ongoing truck and equipment replacement program. Amortization of Intangible Assets. Intangible assets that have a finite life and are amortized generally consist of customer relationships, long term contracts and covenants not to compete. Expenses for amortization of intangible assets were $11.8 million, $6.5 million and $7.0 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, .3%, .2% and .2% for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 versus the comparable 2007 and 2006 periods is due to the amortization of intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisition of Allied. We expect this acquisition will increase our intangible asset amortization expense by approximately $65.0 million in 2009. Accretion Expense. Accretion expense was $23.9 million, $17.1 million and $15.7 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, .7%, .5% and .5% for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars in 2008 versus the comparable 2007 and 2006 periods is primarily due to an increase in asset retirement obligations associated with our acquisition of Allied. The asset retirement obligations acquired from Allied are recorded using a discount rate of 9.75%, which is higher than the credit adjusted, risk free rate we have used historically to record such obligations. Our accretion expense in 2009 will reflect the increase in asset retirement obligations recorded in the acquisition of Allied and the impact of using a higher overall average discount rate for recording these liabilities. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses. Selling, general and administrative expenses were $434.7 million, $313.7 million and $315.0 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 11.8%, 9.9% and 10.3%, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in such expenses both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is primarily due to $14.2 million of bad debt expense related to conforming Allieds methodology for recording the allowance for doubtful accounts on accounts receivable with ours and $5.4 million to provide for specific bankruptcy exposures. This increase is also due to $24.3 million of settlement charges related to our estimates of the outcome of various legal matters. Excluding these costs, selling, general and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 would have been $390.8 million, or 10.6% as a percentage of revenue. The increase in selling, 48 Table of Contents general and administrative expenses (excluding the costs mentioned above) in aggregate dollars during 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is primarily due to our merger with Allied. The increase in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is primarily due to our merger with Allied and a $4.3 million reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts which we recorded during the year ended December 31, 2007 as a result of refining our estimate for our allowance based on our historical collection experience. The increase in such expenses in aggregate dollars for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is primarily due to the expansion of our business. The decrease in such expenses as a percentage of revenue for 2007 versus 2006 is primarily due to a reduction in incentive compensation costs and the $4.3 million reduction to our allowance for doubtful accounts recorded during 2007. Upon the completion of the integration of Allied, our goal is to maintain our selling, general and administrative costs at no more than 10.0% of revenue, which we believe is appropriate given our existing business platform. Asset Impairments. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a $75.9 million charge related to the impairment of our Countywide facility. This impairment relates to the anticipated loss of permitted airspace associated with complying with FOs issued by the OEPA and the AOC issued by the EPA based upon recent negotiations with the OEPA and the EPA. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded a loss of $6.1 million for expected losses on asset divestitures mandated by the DOJ. Also during the year ended December 31, 2008, we recorded $7.8 million of other impairment charges, consisting primarily of charges related to our former corporate headquarters in South Florida. Restructuring Charges. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we incurred $82.7 million of restructuring charges associated with integrating our operations with Allied. These charges primarily consist of severance and other employee termination and relocation benefits and consulting fees paid to outside parties. Operating Income. Operating income was $283.2 million, $536.0 million and $519.5 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 7.7%, 16.9% and 16.9%, for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The reduction in operating income as a percentage of revenue for 2008 versus the comparable 2007 and 2006 periods is primarily due to the remediation, asset impairment and restructuring charges noted above. Interest Expense. We incurred interest expense primarily on our credit facilities, senior notes and tax exempt bonds. Interest expense was $131.9 million, $94.8 million and $95.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The increase in interest expense during the year ended December 31, 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is primarily due to the additional debt we acquired as a result of our acquisition of Allied. In addition, during December 2008, we incurred approximately $10.1 million of non cash interest expense. This expense relates primarily to a $624.3 million discount we recorded to fair value the debt we acquired from Allied that is being amortized generally over the term of the related debt. It also relates to accretion expenses associated with discounted environmental and risk insurance reserves. Capitalized interest was $2.6 million, $3.0 million and $2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Interest Income and Other Income (Expense), Net. Interest income and other income, net of other expense, was $8.0 million, $26.9 million and $20.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The amount in 2007 is primarily due to a $12.5 million gain related to the sale of our compost, mulch and soil business in Texas. Income Taxes. Our provision for income taxes was $85.4 million, $177.9 million and $164.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Our effective income tax rate was 53.6%, 38.0% and 37.0% for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2008, we incurred several expenses that were not tax deductible as a result of the 49 Table of Contents merger with Allied. In addition, lower pre tax earnings contributed to the increase in the effective tax rate. During the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded a net tax benefit of $4.8 million in our provision for income taxes related to the resolution of various income tax matters, including the effective completion of Internal Revenue Service audits of our consolidated tax returns for fiscal years 2001 through 2004. Income tax expense for the year ended December 31, 2006 includes a $5.1 million benefit related to the resolution of various income tax matters, including the effective completion of Internal Revenue Service audits for the years 1998 through 2000. Landfill and Environmental Matters Available Airspace The following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for active landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: Balance Permits Changes Balance as of Acquisition Granted, in Changes as of December 31, of Net of Airspace Engineering in December 31, 2007 Allied Closures Consumed Estimates(1) Design(1) 2008 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,537.3 3,061.1 22.5 (42.7 ) (18.6 ) 4,559.6 Number of sites 58 157 (2 ) 213 Probable expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 192.0 214.1 (18.9 ) (1.0 ) 386.2 Number of sites 11 15 (3 ) 23 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,729.3 3,275.2 3.6 (42.7 ) (18.6 ) (1.0 ) 4,945.8 Number of sites 58 157 (2 ) 213 Balance Landfill Permits Changes Balance as of New Operating Granted, in Changes as of December 31, Expansions Contracts, Net of Airspace Engineering in December 31, 2006 Undertaken Net Closures Consumed Estimates(1) Design(1) 2007 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,597.2 .2 1.2 (40.3 ) 6.9 (27.9 ) 1,537.3 Number of sites 59 (1 ) 58 Probable expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 124.6 74.4 .5 (7.5 ) 192.0 Number of sites 8 3 11 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,721.8 74.4 .2 1.2 (40.3 ) 7.4 (35.4 ) 1,729.3 Number of sites 59 (1 ) 58 Balance Permits Changes as of Granted, in Balance December 31, Net of Airspace Engineering as of December 31, 2005 Closures Consumed Estimates(1) 2006 Permitted airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,577.7 56.6 (43.5 ) 6.4 1,597.2 Number of sites 59 59 Probable expansion airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 177.7 (52.5 ) (.6 ) 124.6 Number of sites 9 (1 ) 8 Total available airspace: Cubic yards (in millions) 1,755.4 4.1 (43.5 ) 5.8 1,721.8 Number of sites 59 59 (1) Changes in engineering estimates typically include minor modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information. Changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfills footprint or vertical slopes. 50 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2008, we owned or operated 213 active solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 4.9 billion in place cubic yards. Total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace. These estimates are developed at least annually by engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys. As of December 31, 2008, total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 4.5 billion in place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus .4 billion in place cubic yards of probable expansion airspace. Before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and, therefore, included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity, it must meet all of our expansion criteria. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 8, Landfill and Environmental Costs, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information. During 2008, total available airspace increased by a net 3.2 billion cubic yards due the merger with Allied in December, which contributed 157 active landfills representing 3.3 billion cubic yards of permitted and probable expansion airspace to our landfill assets. Excluding the merger with Allied, total available airspace decreased by a net .1 billion cubic yards primarily due to airspace consumed, changes in engineering estimates and changes in design. The decrease during 2008 due to changes in engineering estimates is primarily due to a reduction of remaining airspace at our Countywide facility. During 2007, total available airspace increased by a net 7.5 million cubic yards due to new expansions undertaken, changes in engineering estimates and permits granted, partially offset by airspace consumed and changes in design. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2007, total available airspace increased as a result of obtaining a new contract to operate a landfill in Texas, which was substantially offset by a reduction resulting from not renewing a contract to operate a small landfill in Texas. Changes in design in 2007 are primarily due to a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our Countywide facility. During 2006, total available airspace decreased by 33.6 million cubic yards due to airspace consumption, partially offset by permits granted and changes in engineering estimates. At December 31, 2005, 10.1% of our total available airspace, or 177.7 million cubic yards, consisted of probable expansion airspace at nine of our landfills. At December 31, 2008, 7.8% of our total available airspace, or 386.2 million cubic yards, consisted of probable expansion airspace at 23 of our landfills. Between December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2008, we received permits for eight of our probable expansions, which demonstrates our continued success in obtaining permits for expansion airspace. As of December 31, 2008, 23 of our landfills meet all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity, 15 of which were added as a result of our acquisition of Allied. At projected annual volumes, these landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 32 years, including probable expansion airspace. The average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 42 years. We have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for probable expansion airspace. The following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of December 31, 2008: Number of Sites Number of Sites Percent without Expansion with Expansion Total of Airspace Airspace Sites Total 0 to 5 years 19 2 21 9.9 % 6 to 10 years 17 2 19 8.9 11 to 20 years 64 6 70 32.9 21 to 40 years 43 8 51 23.9 41+ years 47 5 52 24.4 Total 190 23 213 100.0 % Sites with expansion airspace include two landfills with less than five years of remaining permitted airspace. 51 Table of Contents Final Capping, Closure and Post Closure Costs As of December 31, 2008, accrued final capping, closure and post closure costs were $1.0 billion, of which $130.6 million is current and $910.0 million is long term as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs. Remediation and Other Charges for Landfill Matters In December 2008, we recorded a preliminary purchase price allocation of $208.1 million for the environmental liabilities we acquired as part of the acquisition of Allied. These liabilities represent our preliminary estimate of our costs to remediate sites that were previously owned or operated by Allied, or sites at which Allied, or a predecessor company that they had acquired, had been identified as a potentially responsible party. The remediation of these sites is in various stages of completion from having received an initial notice from a regulatory agency and commencing investigation to being in the final stages of postremedial monitoring. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Environmental Remediation Liabilities, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information. During 2007, we recorded pre tax charges of $45.3 million related to estimated costs to comply with FOs issued by the OEPA in response to environmental conditions at Countywide and to undertake certain other remedial actions that we agreed with the OEPA to perform, including, without limitation, installing a fire break and removing liquids from gas extraction wells. We also recorded $3.3 million of additional depletion and amortization expense during the year ended December 31, 2007 associated with a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at this landfill as a result of the OEPAs FOs. During 2008, Republic Ohio, an Ohio limited liability company and wholly owned subsidiary of ours and parent of Countywide, entered into an AOC with the EPA requiring the reimbursement of costs incurred by the EPA and requiring Republic Ohio to (a) design and install a temperature and gas monitoring system, (b) design and install a composite cap or cover, and (c) develop and implement an air monitoring program. The AOC became effective on April 17, 2008 and Republic Ohio is complying with the terms of the AOC. We received additional orders from the OEPA in 2008. Based upon current information and engineering analyses and discussions with the OEPA and EPA subsequent to the signing of the above mentioned agreement, we recorded an additional pre tax charge for remediation costs of $98.0 million during 2008. These costs include placing an enhanced cap (in excess of Countywides current permit requirements) over certain portions of the landfill. We have requested relief with respect to certain requirements of the orders received from the OEPA as we believe the requirements should no longer be considered essential in light of the work we have now agreed with the EPA to perform. While we are vigorously pursuing financial contributions from third parties for our costs to comply with the FOs and the additional remedial actions, we have not recorded any receivables for potential recoveries. In addition, during 2008 we recorded an impairment charge of $75.9 million related to a reduction in our estimated remaining airspace at Countywide. During 2007, we recorded a pre tax charge of $9.6 million associated with an increase in estimated leachate disposal costs and costs to upgrade onsite equipment that captures and treats leachate at our closed disposal facility in Contra Costa County, California. These additional costs are attributable to a consent agreement with the California Department of Toxic Substance Control. During 2008, we recorded an additional pre tax charge of $21.9 million for increases in our estimated leachate disposal costs and leachate treatment equipment costs at this facility. On August 1, 2008, Republic Services of Southern Nevada (RSSN), a wholly owned subsidiary of ours, signed a Consent Decree and Settlement Agreement (Consent Decree) with the EPA, the Bureau of Land Management and Clark County, Nevada related to the Sunrise Landfill. Under the Consent Decree, RSSN has agreed to perform certain remedial actions at the Sunrise Landfill for which RSSN and Clark County 52 Table of Contents were otherwise jointly and severally liable. As a result, we recorded, based on managements best estimates, a pre tax charge of $35.0 million during 2008, of which $34.0 million was recorded for remediation costs associated with complying with the Consent Decree. RSSN is currently working with the Clark County Staff and Board of Commissioners to develop a mechanism to fund the costs to comply with the Consent Decree. However, we have not recorded any potential recoveries. The majority of this remediation liability is expected to be paid during 2009 and 2010. It is reasonably possible that we will need to adjust the charges noted above to reflect the effects of new or additional information, to the extent that such information impacts the costs, timing or duration of the required actions. Future changes in our estimates of the costs, timing or duration of the required actions could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. No other significant amounts were charged to income for remediation costs during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. We accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated. We accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities associated with acquisitions of properties through business combinations as a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace, as appropriate. Investment in Landfills The following tables reflect changes in our investment in landfills for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 and the future expected investment as of December 31, 2008 (in millions): Non Cash Balance Additions Additions Transfers Balance as of Acquisition for Asset Charged and Impairments as of December 31, Capital of Retirement SFAS 143 to Other and Transfers December 31, 2007 Additions Allied Obligations Adjustments Expense Adjustments to Held for Sale 2008 Non depletable landfill land $ 52.7 $ .2 $ 115.7 $ $ $ $ .7 $ $ 169.3 Landfill development costs 1,809.1 3.6 2,610.8 20.5 (33.2 ) 74.8 (359.3 ) 4,126.3 Construction in progress landfill 66.4 105.1 .3 (74.0 ) (21.6 ) 76.2 Accumulated depletion and amortization (1,039.5 ) (1.2 ) 0.6 (119.1 ) 155.0 (1,004.2 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 888.7 $ 108.9 $ 2,725.6 $ 20.5 $ (32.6 ) $ (119.1 ) $ 1.5 $ (225.9 ) $ 3,367.6 Balance as of December 31, Expected Future Total 2008 Investment Expected Investment Non depletable landfill land $ 169.3 $ $ 169.3 Landfill development costs 4,126.3 6,137.3 10,263.6 Construction in progress landfill 76.2 76.2 Accumulated depletion and amortization (1,004.2 ) (1,004.2 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 3,367.6 $ 6,137.3 $ 9,504.9 Non Cash Balance Additions Additions Transfers Balance as of Landfill for Asset Charged and as of December 31, Capital Operating Retirement SFAS 143 to Other December 31, 2006 Additions Retirements Contracts Obligations Adjustments Expense Adjustments 2007 Non depletable landfill land $ 52.7 $ $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 52.7 Landfill development costs 1,710.6 .9 (2.5 ) 2.5 19.5 (.7 ) 78.8 1,809.1 Construction in progress landfill 61.1 95.9 (90.6 ) 66.4 Accumulated depletion and amortization (930.6 ) 2.3 (1.1 ) (110.1 ) (1,039.5 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 893.8 $ 96.8 $ (.2 ) $ 2.5 $ 19.5 $ (1.8 ) $ (110.1 ) $ (11.8 ) $ 888.7 53 Table of Contents Non Cash Balance Additions Additions Transfers Balance as of for Asset Charged and as of December 31, Capital Retirement SFAS 143 to Other December 31, 2005 Additions Retirements Obligations Adjustments Expense Adjustments 2006 Non depletable landfill land $ 51.6 $ 1.1 $ $ $ $ $ $ 52.7 Landfill development costs 1,618.4 1.6 (7.0 ) 22.8 (10.3 ) 85.1 1,710.6 Construction in progress landfill 55.8 90.1 (84.8 ) 61.1 Accumulated depletion and amortization (829.3 ) 7.0 .3 (108.1 ) (.5 ) (930.6 ) Net investment in landfill land and development costs $ 896.5 $ 92.8 $ $ 22.8 $ (10.0 ) $ (108.1 ) $ (.2 ) $ 893.8 The following table reflects our net investment in our landfills, excluding non depletable land, and our depletion, amortization and accretion expense for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006: 2008 2007 2006 Number of landfills owned or operated 213 58 59 Net investment, excluding non depletable land (in millions) $ 3,198.3 $ 836.0 $ 841.1 Total estimated available disposal capacity (in millions of cubic yards) 4,945.8 1,729.3 1,721.8 Net investment per cubic yard $ .65 $ .48 $ .49 Landfill depletion and amortization expense (in millions) $ 119.7 $ 110.1 $ 108.1 Accretion expense (in millions) 23.9 17.1 15.7 143.6 127.2 123.8 Airspace consumed (in millions of cubic yards) 42.7 40.3 43.5 Depletion, amortization and accretion expense per cubic yard of airspace consumed $ 3.36 $ 3.16 $ 2.85 The increase in the investment in our landfills, both in aggregate dollars and as an investment per cubic yard, is primarily due to the acquisition of Allied in December 2008. Landfill development cost in the above table include $2.6 billion of purchase price for the acquisition that has been allocated to the permitted and probable expansion airspace acquired based on its fair value as of the date of the acquisition. The increase in depletion, amortization and accretion expense from 2007 to 2008 is primarily due to $5.8 million of accretion expense associated with capping, closure and post closure liabilities acquired from Allied. The asset retirement obligations acquired from Allied are recorded using a discount rate of 9.75%, which is higher than the rate we have historically used. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, regarding SFAS 143 adjustments. The increase in depletion, amortization and accretion expense per cubic yard of airspace consumed from 2006 to 2007 is partially due to an increase of $3.3 million in landfill amortization expense that we recorded during the year ended December 31, 2007 related to reviews of landfill asset retirement obligations at our landfills. This increase is also partially due to $3.3 million of additional depletion and amortization expense we recorded during the year ended December 31, 2007 associated with a reduction of estimated remaining available airspace at our Countywide facility. During the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, our weighted average compaction rate was approximately 1,650 pounds per cubic yard based on our three year historical moving average. Our compaction rates may improve as a result of the settlement and decomposition of waste. As of December 31, 2008, we expect to spend an estimated additional $6.1 billion on existing landfills, primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures, over their expected remaining lives. Our total expected investment, excluding non depletable land, estimated to be $9.3 billion, or $1.89 per cubic yard, is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the units of consumption method. 54 Table of Contents Selected Balance Sheet Accounts The following tables reflect the activity in our allowance for doubtful accounts, final capping, closure, post closure liabilities, environmental remediation liabilities, and accrued self insurance during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (in millions): Allowance for Final Capping, Doubtful Closure and Self Accounts Post Closure Remediation Insurance Balance, December 31, 2007 $ 14.7 $ 277.7 $ 67.5 $ 178.0 Non cash asset additions 20.5 Acquisition of Allied 27.2 813.1 208.1 184.1 SFAS 143 adjustments (32.6 ) Accretion expense 23.9 1.7 1.1 Other additions charged to expense 36.5 155.9 203.0 Transfers to assets held for sale (34.1 ) Payments or usage (12.7 ) (27.9 ) (43.3 ) (180.9 ) Balance, December 31, 2008 65.7 1,040.6 389.9 385.3 Less: Current portion (65.7 ) (130.6 ) (102.8 ) (173.6 ) Long term portion $ $ 910.0 $ 287.1 $ 211.7 Allowance for Final Capping, Doubtful Closure and Self Accounts Post Closure Remediation Insurance Balance, December 31, 2006 $ 18.8 $ 257.6 $ 45.1 $ 157.7 Non cash asset additions 19.5 SFAS 143 adjustments (1.8 ) Accretion expense 17.1 Other additions charged to expense, net of adjustments 3.9 51.4 188.2 Divestitures (.2 ) Payments or usage (7.8 ) (14.7 ) (29.0 ) (167.9 ) Balance, December 31, 2007 14.7 277.7 67.5 178.0 Less: Current portion (14.7 ) (32.6 ) (33.4 ) (59.5 ) Long term portion $ $ 245.1 $ 34.1 $ 118.5 Allowance for Final Capping, Doubtful Closure and Self Accounts Post Closure Remediation Insurance Balance, December 31, 2005 $ 17.3 $ 239.5 $ 50.3 $ 158.6 Non cash asset additions 22.8 SFAS 143 adjustments (10.0 ) Accretion expense 15.7 Other additions charged to expense 8.4 8.5 164.4 Payments or usage (6.9 ) (10.4 ) (13.7 ) (165.3 ) Balance, December 31, 2006 18.8 257.6 45.1 157.7 Less: Current portion (18.8 ) (29.0 ) (13.0 ) (50.7 ) Long term portion $ $ 228.6 $ 32.1 $ 107.0 Our expense related to doubtful accounts as a percentage of revenue for 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 1.0%, .1% and .3%, respectively. The increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts during the year ended December 31, 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is primarily due to the following: $27.2 million related to the acquisition of Allied, $14.2 million to adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts acquired from 55 Table of Contents Allied to conform to Republics accounting policies and $5.4 million related to providing for specific bankruptcy exposures. The reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts during the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is due to an adjustment we recorded in 2007 of $4.3 million as a result of refining our estimate for our allowance based on our historical collection experience. As of December 31, 2008, accounts receivable were $945.5 million, net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $65.7 million, resulting in days sales outstanding of 40, or 25 days net of deferred revenue. At December 31, 2008, our accounts receivable in excess of 90 days old totaled $59.4 million, or 5.9% of gross receivables outstanding. Our expense for self insurance, which includes risk insurance and health insurance for all of our employees, as a percentage of revenue for 2008, 2007 and 2006 was 5.5%, 5.9% and 5.4%, respectively. The decrease in self insurance expense as a percentage of revenue for the year ended 2008 versus the comparable 2007 period is primarily due to lower health insurance costs. The increase in self insurance expense as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2007 versus the comparable 2006 period is primarily due to an increase in the severity of our automobile insurance claims. Property and Equipment The following tables reflect the activity in our property and equipment accounts for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 (in millions): Gross Property and Equipment Non Cash Balance Additions Transfers Impairments as of Acquisitions, for Asset and and Transfers Balance December 31, Capital Net of Retirement SFAS 143 Other to Held for as of December 31, 2007 Additions Retirements Divestitures Obligations Adjustments Adjustments Sale 2008 Other land $ 105.7 $ 1.4 $ (.1 ) $ 358.5 $ $ $ (.7 ) $ (.4 ) $ 464.4 Non depletable landfill land 52.7 .2 115.7 .7 169.3 Landfill development costs 1,809.1 3.6 2,610.8 20.5 (33.2 ) 74.8 (359.3 ) 4,126.3 Vehicles and equipment 1,965.1 232.8 (87.8 ) 1,380.4 2.8 (61.0 ) 3,432.3 Buildings and improvements 346.7 5.0 (7.5 ) 379.9 19.9 (38.0 ) 706.0 Construction in progress landfill 66.4 105.1 .3 (74.0 ) (21.6 ) 76.2 Construction in progress other 11.8 23.9 14.2 (23.5 ) (.1 ) 26.3 Total $ 4,357.5 $ 372.0 $ (95.4 ) $ 4,859.8 $ 20.5 $ (33.2 ) $ $ (480.4 ) $ 9,000.8 Accumulated Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion Additions Impairments Balance Balance Charged Acquisitions, and as of as of December 31, to Net of SFAS 143 Transfers to December 31, 2007 Expense Retirements Divestitures Adjustments Held for Sale 2008 Landfill development costs $ (1,039.5 ) $ (119.1 ) $ $ (1.2 ) $ .6 $ 155.0 $ (1,004.2 ) Vehicle and equipment (1,052.7 ) (208.3 ) 87.5 2.9 23.3 (1,147.3 ) Buildings and improvements (101.0 ) (15.0 ) 1.0 3.9 (111.1 ) Total $ (2,193.2 ) $ (342.4 ) $ 88.5 $ 1.7 $ .6 $ 182.2 $ (2,262.6 ) 56 Table of Contents Gross Property and Equipment Non Cash Balance Additions Balance as of Acquisitions, for Asset Transfers as of December 31, Capital Net of Retirement SFAS 143 and December 31, 2006 Additions Retirements Divestitures Obligations Adjustments Other Adjustments 2007 Other land $ 105.9 $ 1.4 $ (.3 ) $ (3.1 ) $ $ $ 1.8 $ 105.7 Non depletable landfill land 52.7 52.7 Landfill development costs 1,710.6 .9 (2.5 ) 2.5 19.5 (.7 ) 78.8 1,809.1 Vehicles and equipment 1,886.8 173.4 (77.8 ) (22.1 ) 4.8 1,965.1 Buildings and improvements 319.1 2.6 (.1 ) (2.5 ) 27.6 346.7 Construction in progress landfill 61.1 95.9 (90.6 ) 66.4 Construction in progress other 12.3 21.9 (22.4 ) 11.8 Total $ 4,148.5 $ 296.1 $ (80.7 ) $ (25.2 ) $ 19.5 $ (.7 ) $ $ 4,357.5 Accumulated Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion Balance Additions Transfers Balance as of Charged Acquisitions, and as of December 31, to Net of SFAS 143 Other December 31, 2006 Expense Retirements Divestitures Adjustments Adjustments 2007 Landfill development costs $ (930.6 ) $ (110.1 ) $ 2.3 $ $ (1.1 ) $ $ (1,039.5 ) Vehicle and equipment (963.5 ) (176.7 ) 72.1 15.7 (.3 ) (1,052.7 ) Buildings and improvements (90.6 ) (12.2 ) .2 1.6 (101.0 ) Total $ (1,984.7 ) $ (299.0 ) $ 74.6 $ 17.3 $ (1.1 ) $ (.3 ) $ (2,193.2 ) Gross Property and Equipment Non Cash Balance Additions Transfers Balance as of Acquisitions, for Asset and as of December 31, Capital Net of Retirement SFAS 143 Other December 31, 2005 Additions Retirements Divestitures Obligations Adjustments Adjustments 2006 Other land $ 100.9 $ 5.9 $ (1.3 ) $ .4 $ $ $ $ 105.9 Non depletable landfill land 51.6 1.1 52.7 Landfill development costs 1,618.4 1.6 (7.0 ) 22.8 (10.3 ) 85.1 1,710.6 Vehicles and equipment 1,746.8 216.7 (79.3 ) (2.7 ) 5.3 1,886.8 Buildings and improvements 298.7 4.3 (2.1 ) 18.2 319.1 Construction in progress landfill 55.8 90.1 (84.8 ) 61.1 Construction in progress other 18.0 17.9 (.3 ) (23.3 ) 12.3 Total $ 3,890.2 $ 337.6 $ (89.7 ) $ (2.6 ) $ 22.8 $ (10.3 ) $ .5 $ 4,148.5 Accumulated Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion Balance Additions Transfers Balance as of Charged Acquisitions, and as of December 31, to Net of SFAS 143 Other December 31, 2005 Expense Retirements Divestitures Adjustments Adjustments 2006 Landfill development costs $ (829.3 ) $ (108.1 ) $ 7.0 $ $ .3 $ (.5 ) $ (930.6 ) Vehicle and equipment (865.3 ) (169.2 ) 67.3 3.7 (963.5 ) Buildings and improvements (80.3 ) (11.7 ) 1.1 .3 (90.6 ) Total $ (1,774.9 ) $ (289.0 ) $ 75.4 $ 4.0 $ .3 $ (.5 ) $ (1,984.7 ) Liquidity and Capital Resources The major components of changes in cash flows for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 are discussed below. Cash Flows From Operating Activities. Cash provided by operating activities was $512.2 million, $661.3 million and $511.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. The changes in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are primarily due to the expansion of our business, the timing of payments received for accounts receivable, and the timing of payments made for accounts payable and federal income taxes. Cash flow for the year ended 57 Table of Contents December 31, 2008, was negatively impacted by $132.3 million of payments made to the IRS for interest and taxes related to the risk management companies matter discussed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings. This payment was accrued by Allied and in our purchase accounting for the acquisition, and paid in December 2008 to stop further accrual of interest and taxes on this matter. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2006, we paid approximately $83.0 million in income taxes related to fiscal 2005. This tax payment had been deferred as a result of an IRS notice issued in response to Hurricane Katrina. We use cash flows from operations to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments and debt repayments. Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities. Cash used in investing activities was $934.7 million, $260.3 million and $204.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of cash used for capital additions for all periods presented, cash paid, net of cash acquired, of $540.4 million related to the acquisition of Allied in 2008, cash provided by the disposition of our compost, mulch and soil business in Texas in 2007, and cash provided by a decrease in restricted cash in 2006. Capital additions were $386.9 million, $292.5 million and $326.7 million during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash used to acquire businesses, net of cash acquired, was $553.8 million, $4.4 million and $4.9 million during the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. We intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand, restricted cash held for capital expenditures, cash flows from operations, our revolving credit facilities, and tax exempt bonds and other financings. We expect to use primarily cash for future business acquisitions. Cash Flows Provided By (Used In) Financing Activities. Cash provided by financing activities was $469.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 and cash used in financing activities was $408.3 million and $409.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, and consists primarily of purchases of common stock for treasury, proceeds from and payments of notes payable and long term debt, proceeds from issuances of common stock due to stock option exercises and payments of cash dividends. Purchases of common stock for treasury were $138.4 million, $362.8 million and $492.0 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Dividends paid were $128.3 million, $93.9 million and $78.5 million during 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. From 2000 through 2008, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.6 billion of our common stock. As of December 31, 2008, we paid $2.3 billion to repurchase 82.6 million shares of our common stock, of which $138.4 million was paid during 2008 to repurchase 4.6 million shares of our common stock. The stock repurchase program was suspended in the second quarter of 2008 due to the pending merger with Allied. We expect that the share repurchase program will continue to be suspended until at least 2011. We used cash on hand, cash flows from operations and proceeds from issuances of tax exempt bonds to fund capital expenditures, repay debt and fund acquisitions. We intend to use the proceeds from asset divestitures in 2008 to repay debt. We intend to finance future dividend payments through cash on hand, cash flows from operations, our revolving credit facilities and other financings. Financial Condition At December 31, 2008, we had $68.7 million of cash and cash equivalents. We also had $281.9 million of restricted cash deposits, including $133.5 million of restricted cash held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities. In conjunction with the merger with Allied, we entered into a $1.75 billion revolving credit facility with a group of banks in September 2008. The credit facility matures in September 2013. It was used initially at the time of the merger to refinance borrowings and letters of credit under Allieds senior credit facility, to pay fees and expenses in connection therewith, and to pay fees and expenses incurred in connection with the merger. Since the merger, borrowings under the new credit facility are being used for working capital, 58 Table of Contents capital expenditures, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the $1.75 billion credit facility bear interest at a Base Rate, or a Eurodollar Rate, both terms defined in the agreements, plus an applicable margin based on our Debt Ratings, also a term defined in the agreements (see Note 9, Debt, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K). At December 31, 2008, we had $168.9 million available under the $1.75 billion credit facility. In April 2007, we increased our unsecured revolving credit facility to $1.0 billion and extended the term to 2012. In September 2008, we amended the $1.0 billion credit facility to conform certain terms of the facility to be consistent with the new $1.75 billion revolving credit facility. We did not change the maturity date of the credit facility. Borrowings under the $1.0 billion credit facility bear interest at a Base Rate, or a Eurodollar Rate, both terms defined in the agreements, plus an applicable margin based on our Debt Ratings, also a term defined in the agreements. At December 31, 2008, we had $229.6 million available under the $1.0 billion credit facility. In May 1999, we sold $375.0 million of unsecured notes in the public market. These notes bear interest at 7.125% per annum and mature in 2009. Interest on these notes is payable semi annually in May and November. The notes were offered at a discount of $.5 million. In March 2005, we exchanged $275.7 million of our outstanding 7.125% notes due 2009 for new notes due 2035. The new notes bear interest at 6.086%. We paid a premium of $27.6 million related to the exchange. This premium is being amortized over the life of the new notes using the effective yield method. In August 2001, we sold $450.0 million of unsecured notes in the public market. The notes bear interest at 6.75% and mature in 2011. Interest on these notes is payable semi annually in February and August. The notes were offered at a discount of $2.6 million. As part of our acquisition of Allied in December 2008, we acquired Allieds then outstanding senior notes totaling $4.25 billion, with interest rates ranging from 5.75% to 7.875% and maturity dates ranging from 2010 to 2017, $99.5 million and $360.0 million of Allieds debentures with interest rates of 9.25% and 7.40% and maturity dates of 2021 and 2035, respectively, and $230.0 million of Allieds 4.25% convertible debentures due 2034. We also acquired $400.0 million of receivables secured loans, which bear interest at a market based interest rate plus a margin as defined in the agreement. We intend to renew the accounts receivable securitization program when it matures in May 2009; however, if we are unable to renew this facility at favorable terms, we will refinance any then outstanding amounts with our existing credit facilities. In addition, we acquired $527.0 million of tax exempt bonds with interest rates ranging from 5.15% to 11.50% and maturity dates ranging from 2010 to 2031, and other debt of $106.7 million. The total fair value of the debt acquired in the acquisition was $5.4 billion as of the effective date of the merger. See Note 9, Debt to our consolidated financial statements under Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information regarding the debt acquired from Allied. In order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates, we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment grade rated financial institutions. Our outstanding swap agreements have a total notional value of $210.0 million and require us to pay interest at floating rates based on changes in LIBOR and receive interest at a fixed rate of 6.75%. Our swap agreements mature in August 2011. At December 31, 2008, we had $1.3 billion of tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings outstanding of which $527.0 million were acquired in the acquisition of Allied in 2008 and $207.4 million were issued during 2008 for Republic projects. Borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on fixed or floating interest rates at the prevailing market ranging from 3.25% to 11.50% at December 31, 2008 and have maturities ranging from 2010 to 2037. As of December 31, 2008, we had $133.5 million of restricted cash related to proceeds from tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings. This restricted cash will be used to reimburse capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements. 59 Table of Contents We intend to use excess cash on hand, cash from operating activities and proceeds from the asset divestitures to repay debt. We believe that our excess cash, cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due. Despite the current economic conditions, we believe that we will be able to raise additional debt or equity financing, if necessary. Credit Rating We have received investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2008, our senior debt was rated BBB, Baa3, and BBB by Standard Poors Rating Services, Inc., Moodys Investors Service, Inc. and Fitch, Inc., respectively. Fuel Hedges We use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices and other commodity prices. We have entered into multiple option agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases and other commodity prices. Under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities (SFAS 133), the options qualified for, and were designated as, effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases (fuel hedges). We have the following fuel hedges outstanding at December 31, 2008: Notional Amount Contract Price Inception Date Commencement Date Termination Date (in Gallons per Month) per Gallon September 22, 2008 January 1, 2009 December 31, 2011 150,000 $4.1600 4.1700 March 17, 2008 January 5, 2009 December 31, 2012 50,000 3.7200 March 17, 2008 January 5, 2009 December 31, 2012 50,000 3.7400 November 5, 2007 January 5, 2009 December 30, 2013 60,000 3.2815 January 26, 2007 January 5, 2009 December 28, 2009 500,000 2.8270 January 26, 2007 January 4, 2010 December 27, 2010 500,000 2.8100 If the national U.S. on highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel (average price) as published by the Department of Energy exceeds the contract price per gallon, we receive the difference between the average price and the contract price (multiplied by the notional gallons) from the counter party. If the national U.S. on highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel is less than the contract price per gallon, we pay the difference to the counter party. The fair values of our fuel hedges are obtained from third party counter parties and are determined using standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices being based on those observed in underlying markets (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). The aggregated fair values of the outstanding fuel hedges at December 31, 2008 and 2007 were $11.7 million and $11.4 million, respectively, and have been recorded in other current liabilities and other current assets in our consolidated balance sheets, respectively. In accordance with SFAS 133, the effective portions of the changes in fair values as of December 31, 2008 and December 31, 2007, net of tax, of $7.1 million and $6.9 million, respectively, have been recorded in stockholders equity as components of accumulated other comprehensive income. The ineffective portions of the changes in fair values as of December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 were immaterial and have been recorded in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statements of income. Realized gains of $5.9 million and realized losses of $1.6 million and $1.3 million related to these fuel hedges are included in cost of operations in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Commodity Hedges We use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of certain commodities. We have entered into multiple agreements related to certain forecasted 60 Table of Contents commodity sales. Under SFAS 133, the options qualified for, and were designated as, effective hedges of changes in the prices of certain forecasted commodity sales (commodity hedges). We have the following commodity hedges outstanding at December 31, 2008: Notional Amount Contract Price Commencement (in Short Tons per Short Inception Date Date Termination Date Hedged Transaction per Month) Ton May 16, 2008 January 1, 2009 December 31, 2010 Old Corrugated Cardboard 1,000 $ 105.00 May 16, 2008 January 1, 2009 December 31, 2010 Old Newspaper 1,000 102.00 May 16, 2008 January 1, 2009 December 31, 2010 Old Newspaper 1,000 106.00 May 16, 2008 January 1, 2009 December 31, 2010 Old Corrugated Cardboard 1,000 103.00 April 28, 2008 January 1, 2009 December 31, 2010 Old Corrugated Cardboard 1,000 106.00 April 28, 2008 January 1, 2009 December 31, 2010 Old Newspaper 1,000 106.00 April 28, 2008 January 1, 2009 December 31, 2010 Old Corrugated Cardboard 1,000 110.00 April 28, 2008 January 1, 2009 December 31, 2010 Old Newspaper 1,000 103.00 If the price per short ton of the hedging instrument (average price) as reported on the Official Board Market is less than the contract price per short ton, we receive the difference between the average price and the contract price (multiplied by the notional short tons) from the counter party. If the price of the commodity exceeds the contract price per short ton, we pay the difference to the counter party. The fair values of our commodity hedges are obtained from a third party counter party and are determined using standard option valuation models with assumptions about commodity prices being based on those observed in underlying markets (Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy). The aggregated fair value of the outstanding commodity hedges at December 31, 2008 was an asset of $8.8 million and has been recorded in other current assets in our consolidated balance sheet. In accordance with SFAS 133, the effective portions of the changes in fair values as of December 31, 2008, net of tax, of $5.3 million have been recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. The ineffective portion of the changes in fair values as of December 31, 2008 was immaterial and has been recorded in other income (expense), net in our consolidated statement of income. Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008 (in millions): Maturities of Notes Payable Final Capping, Unconditional Year Ending Operating Capital and Other Long Closure and Purchase December 31, Leases Leases(1) Term Debt(2) Post Closure(3) Remediation Commitments(4) Total 2009 $ 44.5 $ 10.3 $ 966.6 $ 130.6 $ 102.8 $ 171.3 $ 1,426.1 2010 36.0 16.2 824.6 86.2 81.1 66.9 1,111.0 2011 29.0 15.3 1,528.0 87.9 46.5 54.7 1,761.4 2012 22.6 40.4 358.0 105.1 35.1 43.9 605.1 2013 20.1 14.7 1,453.9 107.1 30.5 38.8 1,665.1 Thereafter 102.3 290.2 6,966.9 4,491.9 215.6 298.4 12,365.3 Total $ 254.5 $ 387.1 $ 12,098.0 $ 5,008.8 $ 511.6 $ 674.0 $ 18,934.0 (1) The present value of these obligations is included in our consolidated balance sheets. (2) Amounts include interest payments at the stated rate for fixed rate debt or at the applicable rate as of December 31, 2008 for variable rate debt. (3) The estimated remaining final capping, closure and post closure expenditures presented above are uninflated and undiscounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of December 31, 2008. (4) Unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of long term disposal agreements that require us to dispose of a minimum number of tons at third party facilities. In addition to the above, we have unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008 of $611.9 million of which we expect to settle approximately $10.0 million to $20.0 million within the following twelve months. Due to the 61 Table of Contents uncertainty with respect to the timing of future cash flows associated with the unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2008, we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the timing of any cash settlements. We also have letters of credit of $1.7 billion outstanding under our revolving credit facilities and $.1 billion outstanding under other agreements at December 31, 2008. Debt covenants. Our revolving credit facilities contain financial covenants. We have the ability to pay dividends and to repurchase common stock provided that we are in compliance with these covenants. At December 31, 2008, we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our revolving credit facilities. We were also in compliance with the non financial covenants of the indentures relating to our senior notes as of December 31, 2008. On December 10, 2008, we received the requisite consents for a previously announced consent solicitation to amend the supplemental indentures governing certain outstanding debt securities of Allied Waste North America, Inc. (AWNA). The amendment to each supplemental indenture modified the ongoing reporting obligations required of Allied. Under the amended supplemental indentures, the ongoing reporting obligations may be satisfied by Republic. The collateral that had secured the AWNA senior notes and the BFI debentures equally and ratably with the Allied bank credit facility was released upon the completion of the merger with Allied and the repayment of that facility. Failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our revolving credit facilities, as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events, would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under the revolving credit facilities to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreements. This could also have an adverse impact on availability of financial assurances. In addition, maturity acceleration on the revolving credit facilities constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments, including our senior notes and, therefore, our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity. If such acceleration of maturities were to occur, we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness. We would likely have to seek an amendment under our revolving credit facilities for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity, or asset sales, if necessary. We may be unable to amend the revolving credit facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated. Financial assurance. We are required to provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping, closure and post closure costs, and related to our performance under certain collection, landfill and transfer station contracts. We satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds, letters of credit, insurance policies or trust deposits. The amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and post closure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations. The financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and post closure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill. Generally, states will require a third party engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping, closure and post closure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill. The amount of financial assurance required can, and generally will, differ from the obligation determined and recorded under GAAP. The amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract. Additionally, we are required to provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations. We do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during 2009, although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change. These financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not debt of our company. Since we currently have no liability for these financial assurance instruments, they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. However, we record capping, closure and post closure liabilities and self insurance liabilities as they are incurred. The underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments, in excess of those already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, would be 62 Table of Contents recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations. We do not expect this to occur. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet debt or similar obligations, other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases that are not classified as debt. We do not guarantee any third party debt. Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with GAAP, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Our free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is calculated as follows (in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Cash provided by operating activities $ 512.2 $ 661.3 $ 511.2 Purchases of property and equipment (386.9 ) (292.5 ) (326.7 ) Proceeds from sales of property and equipment 8.2 6.1 18.5 Free cash flow $ 133.5 $ 374.9 $ 203.0 Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2008 was negatively impacted by $132.3 million of payments made to the IRS for interest and taxes related to the risk management companies matter discussed in Item 3. Legal Proceedings. This payment was accrued by Allied and included in our purchase accounting allocation for the acquisition, and paid in December 2008 to stop further accrual of interest and taxes on this matter. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2008 was positively impacted due to approximately $32.0 million of federal tax payments being deferred until February 2009 as a result of our merger with Allied. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2007 was higher than anticipated due to lower than expected purchases of property and equipment, higher deferred income taxes and lower payments for asset retirement obligations. Free cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2006 was negatively affected by an $83.0 million federal tax payment for 2005 that had been deferred until February 2006 as a result of an IRS notice issued in response to Hurricane Katrina. Purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the free cash flow above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006 is as follows (in millions): 2008 2007 2006 Purchases of property and equipment presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows $ 386.9 $ 292.5 $ 326.7 Adjustment for property and equipment received during the prior period but paid for in the following period, net (14.9 ) 3.2 10.9 Property and equipment received during the current period $ 372.0 $ 295.7 $ 337.6 The adjustments noted above do not affect either our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows or our free cash flow. 63 Table of Contents We believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment, net of proceeds from sales of property and equipment. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided, maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt, paying cash dividends, and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization. In addition, free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation. The presentation of free cash flow has material limitations. Free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Contingencies For a description of our commitments and contingencies, see Note 10, Income Taxes, and Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements included under Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management. The following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Such critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments. We have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas. Residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast. Accounting for the Acquisition of Allied Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with GAAP. The purchase method of accounting requires that the purchase price paid for an acquisition be allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired based on their estimated fair values as of the effective date of the acquisition, with the excess of the purchase price over the net assets acquired being recorded as goodwill. The consolidated financial statements of the acquirer include the operating results of the acquired business from the date of the acquisition, and are not retroactively restated to include the historical position or the results of operations of the acquired business. These estimates are revised during the allocation period when the information necessary to finalize the fair value estimates is received and analyzed, or if information regarding contingencies becomes available to further define and quantify the assets and liabilities acquired. Republic is in the process of valuing all of the assets and liabilities acquired in our acquisition of Allied. Until we have completed our valuation process, there may be adjustments to our estimates of fair values and the resulting preliminary purchase price allocation reflected in our consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2008. The significant areas of accounting where estimates of fair values are reflected in our consolidated financial statements include landfills and other property and equipment, other intangible assets, landfill asset retirement obligations, legal and environmental reserves, self insurance reserves, income taxes, other non current assets and long term obligations, and assets held for sale. Our consolidated financial statements also include our estimates of restructuring costs incurred through December 31, 2008, a portion of which will be paid in future periods. Changes in our estimates of fair values may impact our results of operations in future periods. 64 Table of Contents Residual risks: The residual risks identified below related to critical accounting judgments and estimates are relevant to the fair value estimation processes for acquisitions. For discussion of other significant residual risks inherent in the accounting for acquisitions, see Item 1A. Risk Factors. Landfill Accounting Landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further herein. Our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories, each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates: Landfill development costs that are capitalized as an asset. Landfill retirement obligations relating to our capping, closure and post closure liabilities which result in a corresponding landfill retirement asset. Landfill Development Costs We use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site. In life cycle accounting, all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized, and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. Obligations associated with final capping, closure and post closure are also capitalized, and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed. Cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers. Site permits. In order to develop, construct and operate a landfill, we are required to obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local, state and federal levels. The permitting process requires an initial siting study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations. The initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval. During the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but prior to the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted. Residual risks: Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes to the landfill site permitting process. These changes could make it more difficult and costly to obtain and maintain the landfill permit. Studies performed could be inaccurate, which could result in the denial or revocation of a permit and changes to accounting assumptions. Conditions could exist that were not identified in the study, which may make the location not feasible for a landfill and could result in the denial of a permit. Denial or revocation of a permit could impair the recorded value of the landfill asset. Actions by neighboring parties, private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain, maintain or expand permits could result in denial, revocation or suspension of a permit, which could adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill and could impair the recorded value of the landfill. As a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit, improved technical information as a project progresses, or changes in the anticipated economics associated with a project, we may decide to reduce the scope of or abandon a project which could result in an asset impairment. Technical landfill design. Upon receipt of initial regulatory approval, technical landfill designs are prepared. The technical designs, which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill, including the types and quantities of materials that will be required, are reviewed by our environmental management group. The technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval. Upon approval of the technical designs, the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill. 65 Table of Contents Residual risks: Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical design. These changes could make it more difficult and costly to meet new design standards. Technical design requirements, as approved, may need modifications at some future point in time. Technical designs could be inaccurate and could result in increased construction costs, difficulty in obtaining a permit or the use of rates to recognize the amortization of landfill development costs and asset retirement obligations that are not appropriate. Permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity. Included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill. These factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed, the depth of excavation, the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the side slope construction. The disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards. This measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a site specific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill. Residual risks: Estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements. The density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions, including waste compaction practices, site design, climate and the nature of the waste. Capacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is measured in tons. The number of tons per cubic yard varies by type of waste. Development costs. The types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes, installation of groundwater monitoring wells, construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site. We review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with third party bids or contractual arrangements, reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness, and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs. These development costs, together with any costs incurred to acquire, design and permit the landfill, including capitalized interest, are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred. Residual risk: Actual future costs of construction materials and third party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the impact from general economic conditions on the availability of the required materials and labor. Technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions, regulatory changes or legislative changes. Landfill development asset amortization. In order to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations, we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a per ton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill. The landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfills operating life. The per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs (as described above) for the landfill by the landfills estimated remaining disposal capacity. The expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted, but rather expressed in nominal dollars. This rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period. Amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill, including acquisition costs, which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values. We secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value. Amortization rates are also influenced by site specific engineering and cost factors. 66 Table of Contents Residual risk: Changes in our future development cost estimates or our disposal capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization rates and will impact amortization expense prospectively. An unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill and result in an asset impairment. On at least an annual basis, we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill. These costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually. Changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually. Landfill Asset Retirement Obligations We have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills: (1) capping and (2) closure and post closure. We account for our final capping, closure and post closure activities in accordance with SFAS 143. Under SFAS 143, obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event. Obligations related to closure and post closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill. Landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units of consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill, depending on the nature of the obligation. All obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value. Fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our credit adjusted, risk free rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred. Future costs for final capping, closure and post closure are developed at least annually by engineers, and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections. Landfill capping. As individual areas within each landfill reach capacity, we are required to cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit. These requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill siting process described above. Closure and post closure. Closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill site stops receiving waste, but prior to being certified as closed. After the entire landfill site has reached capacity and is certified closed, we are required to maintain and monitor the site for a post closure period, which generally extends for 30 years. Costs associated with closure and post closure requirements generally include maintenance of the site and the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems, and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste. Costs associated with post closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling, analysis and statistical reports, third party labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance, transportation and disposal of leachate and erosion control costs related to the final cap. Landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets. Estimates of the total future costs required to cap, close and monitor the landfill as specified by each landfill permit are updated annually. The estimates include inflation, the specific timing of future cash outflows, and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events. Our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation, which is updated annually (2.5% in both 2008 and 2007). The present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and post closure costs for the landfill are recorded as incurred on a per ton basis. These liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill. Capping, closure and post closure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our credit adjusted risk free rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred (6.6% in 2008 and 6.5% in 2007). 67 Table of Contents Retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the same credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities. This accretion expense is charged to operating expenses. Actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made. Corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping, closure and post closure liabilities. The retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a per ton basis as disposal capacity is consumed. The per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation assets net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity. A per ton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event. Closure and post closure per ton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill. Residual risks: Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements including changes in capping, closure activities or post closure monitoring activities, types and quantities of materials used, or term of post closure care could cause changes in our cost estimates. Changes in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in the anticipated waste flow, cost change in airspace compaction estimates or the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results of operations prospectively. This could result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense. Actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing, causing differences in timing of when amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping, closure and post closure liabilities. Changes in inflation rates could impact our actual future costs and our total liabilities. Changes in our capital structure or market conditions could result in changes to the credit adjusted risk free rate used to discount the liabilities, which could cause changes in future recorded liabilities, assets and expense. Amortization rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill capping design, post closure monitoring requirements, or the inflation or discount rate. On an annual basis, we update our estimates of future capping, closure and post closure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill. Revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping, closure and post closure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets. Changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively, except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills, where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed. In connection with the 2008 annual review of our calculations with respect to landfill asset retirement obligations, we made a change in estimate, which is considered to be a change in accounting estimate that is effected by a change in accounting principle as defined by SFAS 154, Accounting Changes and Error Corrections, a replacement of APB Opinion No. 20 and FASB Statement No. 3 (SFAS 154). This change, which we believe is preferable, was made to better align the estimated amount of waste placed in an area to be capped (which is used to calculate our capping rates) with the physical operation of our landfills. The expected costs related to our capping events did not change and we will continue to use separate rates for each capping event. This change resulted in a $32.6 million decrease in our capping asset retirement obligations and related assets. These assets will be amortized to expense prospectively as a change in estimate, in accordance with SFAS 154. This change in estimate will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows. 68 Table of Contents Permitted and probable disposal capacity. As described previously, disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit. We classify this disposal capacity as permitted. We also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates, thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion. Probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies, but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is probable. We have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace. We believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted. However, because some of these criteria are judgmental, they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted. In either of these scenarios, our amortization, depletion and accretion expense could change significantly. Our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion are as follows: We own or control the land associated with the expansion airspace pursuant to an option agreement; We are committed to supporting the expansion project financially and with appropriate resources; There are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated with the project, including political impediments; Progress is being made on the project; The expansion is attainable within a reasonable time frame; and We believe it is likely the expansion permit will be received. After successfully meeting these criteria, the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates. Additionally, for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping, closure and post closure rates, we include the incremental costs to develop, construct, close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity. Residual risk: We may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the final local, state or federal permits or due to other unknown reasons. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity, or the disposal capacity for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated, both our estimated total costs and disposal capacity will be reduced, which generally increases the rates we charge for landfill amortization and capping, closure and post closure accruals. An unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could also cause an asset impairment. Environmental Liabilities We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment. Under current laws and regulations, we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate, including sites that we have acquired, or sites where we have (or a company that we have acquired has) delivered waste. Our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater, surface water and soil contamination, as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs. To estimate our ultimate liability at these sites, we evaluate several factors, including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site, the required remediation methods, the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties. We accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable. We periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary. Changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are 69 Table of Contents recorded to operating income in the period in which the change in estimate is made. Adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts. The majority of our environmental remediation liabilities were acquired as part of our acquisition of Allied. We have accounted for the environmental remediation liabilities we acquired from Allied based on estimates of their fair values, and we have discounted these liabilities in accordance with SFAS 141. Prior to our acquisition of Allied, Allieds environmental remediation liabilities were accounted for in accordance with SFAS No. 5, Accounting for Contingencies (SFAS 5), and American Institute of Certified Public Accountants Statement of Position 96 1, Environmental Remediation Liabilities (SOP 96 1), which require that estimated losses be recorded for loss contingencies if, prior to the issuance of the financial statements, it is probable that liabilities have been incurred and the amounts of the losses can be reasonably estimated. If it is probable that a liability has been incurred, but no estimate of the liability is more likely than any other, a liability is recorded at the lower end of the range. However, amounts recorded under this guidance are generally not considered fair value. Our process for determining the fair value for the environmental liabilities we acquired includes first identifying the population of sites that we either are or have indications that we may be responsible for the costs of remediation. These sites are then assessed to determine the risks that they are, or may be subject to, that would significantly affect either the cost or timing of remediation activities. We use these risk scenarios to develop estimates of future cash flows based on the risks identified. Generally speaking, sites with a higher risk of significant variability in future cash flows or timing of those cash flows have more risk scenarios identified than sites which we deem to be at a lower risk. We then probability weight these risk scenarios and discount these liabilities to present value to determine their fair values. Although we have prepared and recorded a preliminary valuation of the environmental liabilities we acquired from Allied, we do not expect to complete our valuation of these liabilities until 2009. After we have finalized this valuation, future changes in these estimates will be recorded in accordance with SFAS 5 and SOP 96 1. Significant adjustments to these reserves may occur in the future. Our other environmental liabilities are accounted for in accordance with SFAS 5 and SOP 96 1. The recorded liabilities represent our estimate of the most likely outcome of the matters for which we have determined liability is probable. These estimates do not take into account discounts to present value the total estimated costs. We reevaluate these matters as additional information becomes available to ascertain whether the liabilities we have accrued are adequate. We have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies. Residual risks: We cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of our environmental remediation liabilities. Our estimates of these liabilities require assumptions about future events that are uncertain. Consequently, our estimates could change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of contamination, the required remediation methods, the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties identified, the financial viability of those parties, and the actions of governmental agencies or private parties with interests in the matter. Actual amounts could differ from the estimated liabilities as a result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution. An unanticipated environmental liability that arises could result in a material charge to our consolidated statement of income. Self Insurance Reserves and Related Costs Our insurance programs for workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured. Accruals for self insurance reserves are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. We maintain high deductibles for commercial 70 Table of Contents general liability, automobile liability and workers compensation coverages, ranging from $1.0 million to $3.0 million. Residual risks: Incident rates, including frequency and severity, and other actuarial assumptions could change causing our current and future actuarially determined obligations to change, which would be adjusted to our consolidated statement of income in the period in which such adjustment is known. It is possible that recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims. Adjustments, if any, to estimates recorded resulting from ultimate claim payments will be reflected in the consolidated statements of income in the periods in which such adjustments are known. The settlement costs to discharge our obligations, including legal and health care costs, could increase or decrease causing current estimates of our self insurance reserves to change. Loss Contingencies We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and regulatory matters, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. Consistent with SFAS 5, we determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or probable, and whether it can be reasonably estimated. We analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities. Managements assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies. We accrue for loss contingencies when such amounts are probable and reasonably estimable. If a contingent liability is only reasonably possible, we will disclose the potential range of the loss, if estimable. We record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency. Residual risks: Actual costs can vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons including differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments of the amount of damages. Loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and generally involve business matters that are by their nature unpredictable. If a loss contingency results in an adverse judgment or is settled for significant amounts, it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, result of operations or cash flows in the period in which such judgment or settlement occurs. Asset Impairment Valuation methodology. We evaluate our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets or we intend to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets. Residual risk: If events or changes in circumstances occur, including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations or determinations to divest assets, certain assets could be impaired which would result in a non cash charge to earnings. Evaluation criteria. We test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. Examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset, a change in its physical condition, or new circumstances that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not 71 Table of Contents that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a long lived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Residual risk: Our most significant asset impairment exposure, other than goodwill (which is discussed below) relates to our landfills. A significant reduction in our estimated disposal capacity as a result of unanticipated events such as regulatory developments, revocation of an existing permit or denial of an expansion permit, or changes in our assumptions used to calculate disposal capacity could trigger an impairment charge. Recognition criteria. If such circumstances arise, we recognize an impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. We generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value. Goodwill Recoverability Valuation methodology. We evaluate goodwill for impairment based on the estimated fair value of each of our reporting units, which we define as our geographic operating segments. We estimate fair value based on projected net cash flows discounted using our weighted average cost of capital, which was approximately 7.0% in 2008. Residual risk: The estimated fair value of our operating segments could change with changes in our capital structure, cost of debt, interest rates, actual capital expenditure levels, ability to perform at levels that were forecasted or our market capitalization, or other general economic conditions. For example, a reduction in long term growth assumptions could reduce the estimated fair value of the operating segments to below their carrying values, which would trigger an impairment charge. Similarly, an increase in our weighted average cost of capital could trigger an impairment charge. Evaluation criteria. We test goodwill for recoverability on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. For example, a significant adverse change in our liquidity or the business environment, unanticipated competition, a significant adverse action by a regulator, or the disposal of a significant portion of an operating segment could prompt an impairment test between annual assessments. Recognition criteria. We use a two step test to evaluate goodwill impairment. Under the first step, we compare the fair value of each operating segment to its carrying value (including goodwill). If the fair value of the operating segment is less than its carrying value, an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the operating segment and we perform step two of the impairment test. For purposes of performing the second step, we allocate the fair value of each operating segment to all the assets and liabilities of the operating segment as if the operating segment had been acquired in a business combination at the date of the impairment test. We deduct the fair value of tangible net assets and other intangible assets from the fair value of each operating segment to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill for each operating segment. If the implied fair value of an operating segments goodwill is lower than its carrying amount, goodwill is impaired and we write it down to its implied fair value. At the time of a divestiture of an individual business unit within an operating segment, goodwill of the operating segment is allocated to that business unit based on the relative fair value of the unit being disposed to the total fair value of the operating segment and a gain or loss on disposal is determined. Subsequently, the remaining goodwill in the operating segment from which the assets were divested is re evaluated for impairment, which could result in an impairment charge. 72 Table of Contents Residual risk: At the time of divestiture of an individual business unit, we allocate goodwill to the business unit divested and a gain or loss on disposal is calculated. We may incur non cash losses on future sales of business units primarily due to the goodwill allocated to the business units divested. Income Taxes We account for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes (SFAS 109). Accordingly, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets (other than non deductible goodwill) and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income taxes. Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with SFAS 109. FIN 48 provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. This interpretation also provides guidance on measurement, derecognition, classification, interest and penalties, and accounting in interim periods. We recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income. Accrued interest and penalties are included within other accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes and other long term tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Residual risks: Income tax assets and liabilities established in purchase accounting for acquisitions are based on assumptions that could differ from the ultimate outcome of the tax matters. Such adjustments would be charged or credited to earnings pursuant to SFAS 141(R), Business Combinations, unless they meet certain remeasurement criteria and are allowed to be adjusted to goodwill. Changes in the estimated realizability of deferred tax assets could result in adjustments to our provision for income taxes. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes are based on our judgment. If our judgments and estimates concerning valuation allowances and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards are incorrect, our provision for income taxes would change. We are currently under examination or administrative review by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years. The Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and income tax regulations are a complex set of rules that we are required to interpret and apply to our transactions. Positions taken in tax years under examination or subsequent years are subject to challenge. Accordingly, we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities arising from these audits if any positions taken by us or by companies we have acquired are disallowed by the taxing authorities. 73 Table of Contents We recognize tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions in accordance with FIN 48, and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, their ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimates of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to our provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan, the BFI Retirement Plan (the Plan), as a result of our acquisition of Allied in December 2008. The Plan covers certain employees in the United States, including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements. The Plans benefit formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in the Plan document. The benefits of approximately 97% of the current plan participants were frozen upon Allieds acquisition of BFI in 1999. Our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and IRC, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. No contributions were required during the last three years and no contributions are anticipated for 2009. The Plans assets are invested as determined by our Retirement Benefits Committee. At December 31, 2008, the plan assets were invested in fixed income bond funds, equity funds and cash. We annually review and adjust the plans asset allocation as deemed necessary. Residual risk: Changes in the plans investment mix and performance of the equity and bond markets and fund managers could impact the amount of pension income or expense recorded, the funded status of the plan and the need for future cash contributions. Assumptions. The benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the Plan are determined based on assumptions concerning items such as discount rates, expected rates of return and average rates of compensation increases. Our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary. We determine the discount rate based on a model which matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the Plan measurement date. Where that timing does not correspond to a published high quality bond rate, our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate. The yield on the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability. If the discount rate increases by 1%, our benefit obligation would decrease by approximately $34.0 million. If the discount rate were to decrease by 1%, our benefit obligation would increase by approximately $39.0 million. In developing our expected rate of return assumption, we evaluate long term expected and historical returns on the Plan assets, giving consideration to our asset mix and the anticipated duration of the Plan obligations. The average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned. Less than 3% of participants in the Plan continue to earn service benefits. Residual risks: Our assumed discount rate is sensitive to changes in market based interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate will increase our related benefit plan obligation. Our annual pension expense would be impacted if the actual return on plan assets were to vary from the expected return. 74 Table of Contents New Accounting Standards For a description of the new accounting standards that may affect us, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements included in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk The table below provides information about certain of our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement. Our major market risk exposure is changing interest rates in the United States and fluctuations in LIBOR. We intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. All items described below are non trading. Expected Maturity Date Fair Value of (Asset)/ Liability as of December 31, 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 Thereafter Total 2008 Fixed Rate Debt: Amount outstanding (in millions) $ 107.4 $ 387.5 $ 1,138.1 $ 38.4 $ 464.2 $ 4,463.7 $ 6,599.3 $ 6,143.8 Average interest rates 7.25 % 6.65 % 6.33 % 6.28 % 7.91 % 6.33 % 6.47 % Variable Rate Debt: Amount outstanding (in millions) $ 400.0 $ $ $ $ 675.0 $ 850.1 $ 1,925.1 $ 1,893.7 Average interest rates 3.00 % 3.19 % 1.24 % 2.29 % Interest Rate Swaps: Fixed to variable notional amount (in millions) $ $ $ 210.0 $ $ $ $ 210.0 $ 15.1 Average pay rate % % 3.74 % % % % 3.74 % Average receive rate % % 6.75 % % % % 6.75 % The fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value, since interest rates are variable and, thus, approximate current market rates. Fuel Price Risk Fuel costs represent a significant operating expense. When economically practical, we may enter into new or renewal contracts, or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk. Where appropriate, we have implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our fuel costs. While we charge these fees to a majority of our customers, we are unable to charge such fees to all customers. Consequently, an increase in fuel costs results in (1) an increase in our cost of operations, (2) a smaller increase in our revenue (from the fuel recovery fee) and (3) a decrease in our operating margin percentage, since the increase in revenue is more than offset by the increase in cost. Conversely, a decrease in fuel costs results in (1) a decrease in our cost of operations, (2) a smaller decrease in our revenue and (3) an increase in our operating margin percentage. At our current consumption levels, a one cent change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately $1.7 million on an annual basis, which would be partially offset by a smaller change in the fuel recovery fees charged to our customers. Accordingly, a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations. Our operations also require the use of certain petroleum based products (such as liners at our landfills) whose costs may vary with the price of oil. An increase in the price of oil could increase the cost of those products, which would increase our operating and capital costs. We are also susceptible to increases in indirect fuel surcharges from our vendors. Commodities Prices We market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from our material recycling facilities. As a result, changes in the market prices of these items will impact our results of operations. Revenue from sales of recycled cardboard and newspaper in 2008, 2007 and 2006 were approximately $121.1 million, $113.9 million and $80.1 million, respectively. 75 Table of Contents
