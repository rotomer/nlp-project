ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS You should read the following discussion in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto, included elsewhere in this Form 10 K. This discussion may contain forward looking statements that anticipate results based on managements plans that are subject to uncertainty. We discuss in more detail various factors that could cause actual results to differ from expectations in Item 1A, Risk Factors in this Form 10 K. Overview We are the second largest provider of services in the domestic non hazardous solid waste industry, as measured by revenue. We provide non hazardous solid waste collection services for commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers through 334 collection operations in 39 states and Puerto Rico. We own or operate 194 transfer stations, 191 active solid waste landfills and 74 materials recovery facilities. We also operate 69 landfill gas and renewable energy projects. Revenue for the year ended December 31, 2011 was $8,192.9 million compared to $8,106.6 million for the same period in 2010. Core price for the year ended December 31, 2011 increased 0.8%, fuel recovery fees increased 1.0%, commodity revenue increased 1.0% and acquisitions, net of divestitures increased 0.1%. Offsetting this revenue growth of 2.9% were decreases of 1.4% due to the expiration of our San Mateo County contract and our transportation and disposal contract with the City of Toronto effective December 31, 2010 and 0.4% from volume declines. The following table summarizes our operating revenue, costs and expenses in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009: $8,106.6 $8,106.6 $8,106.6 $8,106.6 $8,106.6 $8,106.6 2011 2010 2009 Revenue $ 8,192.9 100.0 % $ 8,106.6 100.0 % $ 8,199.1 100.0 % Expenses: Cost of operations 4,865.1 59.4 4,764.8 58.8 4,844.2 59.1 Depreciation, amortization anddepletion of property and equipment 766.9 9.4 762.2 9.4 799.1 9.7 Amortization of other intangible assetsand other assets 76.7 0.9 71.5 0.9 70.6 0.9 Accretion 78.0 0.9 80.5 1.0 88.8 1.1 Selling, general and administrative 825.4 10.1 858.0 10.6 880.4 10.7 Loss (gain) on disposition of assets andimpairments, net 28.1 0.3 19.1 0.2 (137.0 ) (1.7 ) Restructuring charges 11.4 0.1 63.2 0.8 Operating income $ 1,552.7 19.0 % $ 1,539.1 19.0 % $ 1,589.8 19.4 % Pre tax income was $906.3 million, $877.0 million and $865.0 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc. was $589.2 million, or $1.56 per diluted share, for the year ended December 31, 2011, compared to $506.5 million, or $1.32 per diluted share, in 2010 and $495.0 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, in 2009. 32 Table of Contents During each of the three years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recorded a number of gains, charges (recoveries) and other expenses that impacted our pre tax income, net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc. (Net Income Republic) and diluted earnings per share as noted in the following table (in millions, except per share data). Additionally, see our Income Taxes discussion contained in the Results of Operations section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.

During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we completed refinancing transactions that resulted in cash paid for premiums and professional fees to repurchase outstanding debt as well as the non cash write off of unamortized debt discounts and deferred issuance costs. For more detailed discussion of the components of these costs and the debt series to which they relate, see our Loss on Extinguishment of Debt discussion contained in the Results of Operations section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Costs to achieve synergies. During the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we incurred incremental costs to achieve our synergy plan that are recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. These incremental costs primarily relate to our synergy incentive plan as well as other integration costs. We did not incur any such expenses during the year ended December 31, 2011. We expect to pay amounts earned under the synergy incentive plan during the first quarter of 2012. Restructuring charges. During the year ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, we incurred restructuring and integration charges related to the Allied acquisition. These charges consist of severance and other employee termination and relocation benefits as well as consulting and professional fees. Substantially all of these charges were recorded in our corporate segment. We completed our restructuring plan in 2010, and we did not incur any additional restructuring charges related to the Allied acquisition in 2011. Remediation recoveries, net. During 2009, we recovered $12.0 million of insurance proceeds related to remediation costs at the Countywide facility, which were partially offset by additional charges of $5.2 million at our closed disposal facility in California. Loss (gain) on disposition of assets and impairments, net. For more detailed discussion of the components of these costs, see our Loss (Gain) on Disposition of Assets and Impairments, Net discussion contained in the Results of Operations section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. We believe the presentation of adjusted pre tax income, adjusted net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc. and adjusted diluted earnings per share, which are not measures determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, provide an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. We use these measures, and believe investors will find them helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our 33 Table of Contents operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. Comparable charges and costs have been incurred in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. Our definition of adjusted pre tax income, adjusted net income attributable to Republic Services, Inc. and adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. 2012 Guidance Our objectives for 2012 remain consistent with previous years and focus on enhancing stockholder value by increasing returns on invested capital and efficiently using free cash flow. We remain committed to continuing our broad based pricing initiatives across all lines of business to recover increasing costs and to expand our operating margins. Our guidance is based on current economic conditions and does not assume any improvement or deterioration in the overall economy in 2012. Specific guidance follows: Revenue We expect 2012 revenue to increase by approximately 1.5 to 2.0%. This consists of the following: Increase(Decrease) Core price 1.0 to 1.5 % Volume 0.5 % Fuel recovery fees 0.2 % Recycling commodities (0.7 )% Acquisitions / divestitures, net 0.5 % Total change 1.5 to 2.0 % Changes in price are restricted on approximately 50% of our annual revenue. These restrictions include: price changes based upon fluctuation in a specific index as defined in the contract; fixed price increases based on stated contract terms; or price changes based on a cost plus a specific profit margin or other measurement. Of these restricted pricing arrangements, approximately 65% are based on a consumer price index, 20% are fixed arrangements and the remainder are based upon a cost plus or other specific arrangement. The consumer price index varies from a single historical stated period of time or an average of trailing historical rates over a stated period of time. In addition, many pricing resets lag between the measurement period and the date the revised pricing goes into effect. As a result, current changes in a specific index, such as the consumer price index, may not manifest themselves in our reported pricing for several quarters into the future. Adjusted Diluted Earnings per Share The following is a summary of anticipated adjusted diluted earnings per share for the year ended December 31, 2012, which are not measures determined in accordance with GAAP, excluding loss on extinguishment of debt: (Anticipated)YearEndedDecember 31,2012 Diluted earnings per share $ 1.80 1.84 Loss on extinguishment of debt 0.18 Adjusted diluted earnings per share $ 1.98 2.02 34 Table of Contents We believe that the presentation of adjusted diluted earnings per share, which excludes loss on extinguishment of debt, provides an understanding of operational activities before the financial impact of certain items. We use this measure, and believe investors will find it helpful, in understanding the ongoing performance of our operations separate from items that have a disproportionate impact on our results for a particular period. Comparable charges and costs have been incurred in prior periods, and similar types of adjustments can reasonably be expected to be recorded in future periods. Our definition of adjusted diluted earnings per share may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. During 2012, we expect to call and refinance $750.0 million of our June 2017 6.875% Senior Notes. As of December 31, 2011 the unamortized discount associated with these notes was $75.8 million. Early extinguishment of the notes will result in an impairment charge in the amount of the unamortized note discount as well as any premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase. Property and Equipment In 2012, we anticipate receiving approximately $860 million of property and equipment as follows: Trucks and equipment $ 319 Landfill 289 Containers 126 Facilities and other 126 Property and equipment received during 2012 $ 860 Purchases of property and equipment as reflected on our consolidated statement of cash flows for 2012 are expected to be approximately $920 million. The difference between property and equipment received and purchases of property and equipment is approximately $60 million of property and equipment received during 2011 but paid for in 2012. Results of Operations Years Ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 Revenue We generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations. Our remaining revenue is from other services, including transfer stations, landfill disposal and recycling. Our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial, industrial, municipal and residential customers. Our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on long term contracts with municipalities. We generally provide commercial and industrial collection services to customers under contracts with terms up to three years. Our transfer stations, landfills and, to a lesser extent, our material recovery facilities generate revenue from disposal or tipping fees. In general, we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials. Other revenue consists primarily of revenue from National Accounts. National Accounts revenue represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas, where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators. Consequently, substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations. 35 Table of Contents The following table reflects our revenue by line of business for the years ended December 31 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue): 2011 2010 2009 Collection: Residential $ 2,135.7 26.1 % $ 2,173.9 26.8 % $ 2,187.0 26.7 % Commercial 2,487.5 30.4 2,486.8 30.7 2,553.4 31.1 Industrial 1,515.4 18.5 1,482.9 18.3 1,541.4 18.8 Other 32.9 0.4 29.6 0.4 26.9 0.3 Total collection 6,171.5 75.4 6,173.2 76.2 6,308.7 76.9 Transfer 978.0 1,030.3 1,111.1 Less: Intercompany (556.6 ) (587.9 ) (611.2 ) Transfer, net 421.4 5.1 442.4 5.4 499.9 6.1 Landfill 1,867.6 1,865.8 1,892.5 Less: Intercompany (846.9 ) (861.7 ) (891.6 ) Landfill, net 1,020.7 12.5 1,004.1 12.4 1,000.9 12.2 Sale of recyclable materials 438.6 5.4 337.9 4.2 229.8 2.8 Other non core 140.7 1.6 149.0 1.8 159.8 2.0 Other 579.3 7.0 486.9 6.0 389.6 4.8 Total revenue $ 8,192.9 100.0 % $ 8,106.6 100.0 % $ 8,199.1 100.0 % The following table reflects changes in our adjusted revenue for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. We have presented the components of our revenue changes for the year ended December 31, 2009 assuming the Allied acquisition occurred on January 1, 2008: 2011 2010 2009 Core price 0.8 % 1.6 % 3.0 % Fuel recovery fees 1.0 0.5 (2.5 ) Recycling commodities 1.0 1.4 (1.7 ) Total price 2.8 3.5 (1.2 ) Volume (0.4 ) (3.5 ) (9.5 ) San Mateo and Toronto contract losses (1.4 ) Total internal growth 1.0 (10.7 ) Acquisitions / divestitures, net 0.1 (1.1 ) (1.4 ) Intercompany eliminations (0.3 ) Total 1.1 % (1.1 )% (12.4 )% The intercompany eliminations relates to prior year transactions between Republic and Allied that would have been eliminated if the companies had merged on January 1, 2008. Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current years presentation. Revenue 2011 versus 2010 The increase in revenue in 2011 compared to 2010 is due to the following: Changes in core price increased revenue by 0.8% in 2011 compared to 1.6% in 2010. The lower core price increase in 2011 compared to 2010 is due primarily to the competitive municipal and franchise contract pricing environment in our residential collection line of business and the continued low 36 Table of Contents inflationary environment, which limits our price increases on index based contracts, partially offset by our continued broad based pricing initiatives particularly in our landfill line of business. Changes in fuel recovery fees increased revenue by 1.0% in 2011 compared to 0.5% in 2010. Revenue benefited from increased fuel recovery fees due to higher fuel prices during 2011 that were passed along to our customers. Changes in recycling commodity prices increased revenue by 1.0% in 2011 compared to 1.4% in 2010. Revenue benefited from higher commodity prices for recovered materials until the fourth quarter of 2011, when changes in recycling commodity prices decreased revenue by 0.1% year over year. Changes in core volume decreased revenue by 0.4% in 2011 compared to 3.5% in 2010. Core volume continued to decline throughout 2011, but at a lower rate of decline than earlier in the year or during 2010. Core volume in our industrial collection and landfill lines of business was positive in 2011 primarily driven by special event work, offset by declines in our commercial and residential collection and transfer station lines of business. Our San Mateo County contract and our transportation and disposal contract with the City of Toronto ended effective December 31, 2010, which reduced our revenue growth by 1.4%. Revenue 2010 versus 2009 The decrease in revenue in 2010 compared to 2009 is due to the following: Changes in core price increased revenue by 1.6% in 2010 compared to 3.0% in 2009. The lower core price increase in 2010 compared to 2009 is due primarily to the lower inflationary environment, which limits our price increases on index based contracts, partially offset by our continued broad based pricing initiatives. Changes in fuel recovery fees increased revenue by 0.5% in 2010 compared to a decrease of 2.5% in 2009. Revenue benefited from fuel recovery fees resulting from higher fuel costs that were passed along to our customers in 2010. The increase in fuel recovery fees in 2010 compared to 2009 is directly attributable to an increase in fuel costs. Changes in recycling commodity prices increased revenue by 1.4% in 2010 compared to a decrease of 1.7% in 2009. Revenue benefited from higher commodity prices for recovered materials in 2010 compared to 2009. Changes in core volume decreased revenue by 3.5% in 2010 compared to 9.5% in 2009. During 2010, we continued to experience negative core growth in all lines of business, especially in temporary roll off within our industrial collection business in the first half of 2010. Core volume continued to decline throughout 2010, but at a lower rate than earlier in the year or in 2009. The DOJ required us to divest of certain assets and related liabilities in connection with the Allied acquisition. The resulting divestitures, as well as other divestitures in the normal course of business, decreased revenue by 1.1% in 2010 and 1.4% in 2009. Cost of Operations Cost of operations includes labor and related benefits, which consists of salaries and wages, health and welfare benefits, incentive compensation and payroll taxes. It also includes transfer and disposal costs representing tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities and transfer stations; maintenance and repairs relating to our vehicles, equipment and containers, including related labor and benefit costs; transportation and subcontractor 37 Table of Contents costs, which include costs for independent haulers who transport our waste to disposal facilities and costs for local operators who provide waste handling services associated with our national accounts in markets outside our standard operating areas; fuel, which includes the direct cost of fuel used by our vehicles, net of fuel credits; disposal franchise fees and taxes consisting of landfill taxes, municipal franchise fees, host community fees and royalties; landfill operating costs, which includes financial assurance, leachate disposal and other landfill maintenance costs; risk management, which includes casualty insurance premiums and claims; cost of goods sold, which includes material costs paid to suppliers associated with recycling commodities; and other, which includes expenses such as facility operating costs, equipment rent and gains or losses on sale of assets used in our operations. The following table summarizes the major components of our cost of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of our revenue): 2011 2010 2009 Labor and related benefits $ 1,530.4 18.7 % $ 1,534.4 18.9 % $ 1,561.0 19.0 % Transfer and disposal costs 636.1 7.8 664.3 8.2 707.3 8.6 Maintenance and repairs 632.1 7.7 609.7 7.5 649.2 7.9 Transportation and subcontract costs 443.4 5.4 466.7 5.8 490.5 6.0 Fuel 516.5 6.3 407.6 5.0 349.8 4.3 Franchise fees and taxes 395.7 4.8 395.8 4.9 403.7 4.9 Landfill operating costs 126.1 1.5 136.2 1.7 117.8 1.4 Risk management 167.5 2.0 171.6 2.1 212.0 2.6 Cost of goods sold 146.8 1.8 103.9 1.3 63.3 0.8 Other 270.5 3.4 274.6 3.4 289.6 3.6 Total cost of operations $ 4,865.1 59.4 % $ 4,764.8 58.8 % $ 4,844.2 59.1 % The cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies. Thus, you should take care when comparing our cost of operations by cost component to that of other companies. Cost of Operations 2011 versus 2010 Our cost of operations, as a percentage of revenue, increased 0.6% in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily as a result of the following: An increase in fuel expenses of $108.9 million, or 26.7% year over year. The average fuel price per gallon for 2011 was $3.85, an increase of $0.86 or approximately 28.8% from an average price of $2.99 for 2010. At our current consumption levels, a one cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately $1.4 million on an annual basis, which would be partially offset by a smaller change in the fuel recovery fees charged to our customers. Accordingly, a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations. An increase in cost of goods sold primarily due to changes in the market price of recycling commodities and an increase in volumes processed year over year. The average price for old corrugated cardboard (OCC) for 2011 was $159 per ton versus $142 per ton for the comparable 2010 period. The average price of old newspaper (ONP) for 2011 was $142 per ton versus $111 per ton for the comparable 2010 period. At current volumes and mix of materials, we believe a ten dollar per ton change in the price of recyclable materials will change revenue and operating income by approximately $27 million and $18 million, respectively, on an annual basis. 38 Table of Contents These increases were partially offset by: A decrease in labor and related benefits expenses due to volume related workforce reductions, including the expiration of the San Mateo contract, as well as increased productivity gains primarily due to the automation of our residential fleet and lower benefit plan costs. Partially offsetting these declines were increases in overall wages and increases in workforce due to acquisitions. A decrease in transfer and disposal costs due to the divestiture of transfer stations in 2010 as well as overall lower collection volumes. During 2011, 2010 and 2009, approximately 66%, 67% and 68%, respectively, of the total waste volume that we collected was disposed at landfill sites that we own or operate (internalization). A decrease in transportation and subcontract costs primarily due to the expiration of our San Mateo County contract and our transportation and disposal contract with the City of Toronto and a decline in our overall collection volumes. Partially offsetting these decreases were increases due to fuel recovery fees related to project work with certain of our National Accounts customers. Cost of Operations 2010 versus 2009 Our cost of operations, as a percentage of revenue, decreased 0.3% for 2010 compared to 2009, primarily as a result of the following: Transfer and disposal, maintenance and repair, and transportation and subcontract costs decreased versus the comparable 2009 period due to lower waste volumes and cost control measures. Risk management costs decreased during 2010 as we continued to experience favorable actuarial developments primarily attributable to our continued focus on safety. These decreases were partially offset by: Fuel expenses increased by $57.8 million, or 16.5%, year over year. The average fuel price per gallon for 2010 was $2.99, an increase of $0.52 or approximately 21% from an average price of $2.47 for 2009. Landfill operating costs increased by $18.4 million, or 15.6%, year over year. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recovered $12.0 million of insurance proceeds related to remediation costs at the Countywide facility, which reduced our landfill operating costs during that period. There were no such recoveries during 2010. The remainder of the increase in landfill operating costs is due to adjustments recorded to remediation reserves. Depreciation, Amortization and Depletion of Property and Equipment The following table summarizes depreciation, amortization and depletion of property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue): 2011 2010 2009 Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment $ 511.4 6.2 % $ 511.6 6.3 % $ 520.6 6.3 % Landfill depletion and amortization 255.5 3.1 250.6 3.1 278.5 3.4 Depreciation, amortization and depletion expense $ 766.9 9.3 % $ 762.2 9.4 % $ 799.1 9.7 % 39 Table of Contents Landfill depletion and amortization increased in aggregate dollars slightly during 2011 due to increased volumes year over year. The decrease in landfill depletion and amortization in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue for 2010 versus 2009 is due to a reduction of amortization expense associated with lower landfill volumes and assets divested as required by the DOJ. Depreciation and amortization of property and equipment, as a percentage of revenue, has remained consistent for 2011, 2010 and 2009. Amortization of Other Intangible and Other Assets Expenses for amortization of intangible and other assets were $76.7 million, $71.5 million and $70.6 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 0.9% for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our other intangible and other assets primarily relate to customer lists, franchise agreements, municipal contracts, trade names, favorable lease assets and to a lesser extent non compete agreements. Amortization of intangible assets in aggregate dollars increased slightly during 2011 as compared to 2010 due to increased acquisition activity. Accretion Expense Accretion expense was $78.0 million, $80.5 million and $88.8 million, or, as a percentage of revenue, 1.0% for 2011 and 2010 and 1.1% for 2009. The amounts have remained relatively unchanged as our asset retirement obligations remained relatively consistent period over period. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses include salaries, health and welfare benefits and incentive compensation for corporate and field general management, field support functions, sales force, accounting and finance, legal, management information systems, and clerical and administrative departments. Other expenses include rent and office costs, fees for professional services provided by third parties, marketing, investor and community relations, directors and officers insurance, general employee relocation, travel, entertainment and bank charges, but excludes any such amounts recorded as restructuring charges. The following table provides the components of our selling, general and administrative expenses for the three years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue): 2011 2010 2009 Salaries $ 539.6 6.6 % $ 538.6 6.6 % $ 548.1 6.7 % Provision for doubtful accounts 20.9 0.3 23.6 0.3 27.3 0.3 Costs to achieve synergies 33.3 0.4 41.6 0.5 Other 264.9 3.2 262.5 3.3 263.4 3.2 Total selling, general and administrative expenses $ 825.4 10.1 % $ 858.0 10.6 % $ 880.4 10.7 % The cost categories shown above may change from time to time and may not be comparable to similarly titled categories used by other companies. Thus, you should take care when comparing our selling, general and administrative expenses by cost component to that of other companies. Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2011 versus 2010 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $32.6 million for 2011 versus 2010, or 0.5% as a percentage of revenue. Selling, general and administrative expenses include an accrual for synergy bonus related to the Allied acquisition of approximately $33 million in 2010. In 2011, we did not incur any additional costs to achieve synergies. 40 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expenses 2010 versus 2009 Selling, general and administrative expenses decreased $22.4 million for 2010 versus 2009 and, as a percentage of revenue, remained consistent with 2009. Loss (Gain) on Disposition of Assets and Impairments, Net Loss (gain) on disposition of assets and impairments, net of costs to sell, was $28.1 million, $19.1 million and $(137.0) million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2011, we disposed of businesses in various markets, resulting in a gain of $21.0 million including transaction costs. In connection with the dispositions, we closed a landfill, resulting in an asset impairment charge of $28.7 million for the remaining landfill assets and the acceleration of capping, closure and post closure obligations. Additionally, we recorded asset impairments of $20.4 million primarily related to certain long lived assets that are held for sale and for losses on the divestiture of certain businesses and related goodwill. Proceeds from dispositions of solid waste assets were $14.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2011. We divested certain assets throughout 2010 resulting in a net loss on disposition of assets of $4.0 million, including transaction costs. Additionally, we recorded an impairment loss of $15.1 million related to certain long lived assets that are held and used. During the year ended December 31, 2009, we divested of certain assets as required by the DOJ as a condition of the Allied acquisition and recorded a gain of $153.5 million. Offsetting this gain was a loss of $10.2 million recognized in connection with the divestiture of a hauling operation in Miami Dade County, Florida as well as $7.1 million of additional asset impairments, primarily related to our former corporate offices and other assets sold or held for sale. Restructuring Charges During 2010 and 2009, we incurred $11.4 million and $63.2 million, respectively, of restructuring and integration charges related to the integration of Allied, which consisted of charges and adjustments for severance, employee termination and relocation benefits. The remainder of the charges primarily related to consulting and professional fees. Substantially all of these charges were recorded in our corporate segment. We completed our restructuring plan in 2010, and we did not incur any additional restructuring charges related to the Allied acquisition in 2011. Interest Expense The following table provides the components of interest expense, including accretion of debt discounts and accretion of discounts primarily associated with environmental and self funded risk insurance liabilities assumed in the Allied acquisition (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Interest expense on debt and capital lease obligations $ 372.9 $ 413.2 $ 453.5 Accretion of debt discounts 25.6 52.4 92.1 Accretion of remediation and risk reserves 49.8 48.1 58.1 Less: capitalized interest (8.1 ) (6.3 ) (7.8 ) Total interest expense $ 440.2 $ 507.4 $ 595.9 The decrease in interest expense is due to refinancing our higher interest rate debt and the net reduction of borrowings. Accretion of debt discounts continues to decrease as the discounts are written off upon refinancing the associated debt. 41 Table of Contents The debt we assumed from Allied was recorded at fair value as of December 5, 2008. We recorded a discount of $624.3 million, which is amortized as interest expense over the applicable terms of the related debt instruments or written off upon refinancing. The remaining unamortized discounts on the outstanding debt assumed from Allied as of December 31, 2011 are as follows (in millions): RemainingDiscount ExpectedAmortizationOver the NextTwelve Months $750.0 million 6.875% senior notes due June 2017 $ 75.8 $ 11.3 $99.5 million 9.250% debentures due May 2021 2.0 0.1 $360.0 million 7.400% debentures due September 2035 41.9 0.5 Other, maturing 2014 through 2031 15.8 2.9 Total $ 135.5 $ 14.8 Loss on Extinguishment of Debt During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we completed financing transactions that resulted in cash paid for premiums and professional fees to repurchase debt as well as the non cash write off of unamortized debt discounts and deferred issuance costs.

Our effective income tax rate was 35.0%, 42.1% and 42.6% for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our 2011 effective tax rate was favorably impacted by our December 2011 settlement with the IRS related to Allieds 2000 2003 tax years, which contributed to a net favorable impact to our tax provision of approximately $23 million. Additionally, our 2011 tax provision was favorably impacted by the realization of tax credits and lower state rates due to changes in estimates of approximately $19 million. In 2010 and 2009 our effective income tax rate was adversely impacted by the disposition of assets that had little or no basis for tax and accruals for penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions. Our effective income tax rate can be adversely impacted by expenses incurred that are non deductible for tax purposes, disposition of assets that have little or no basis for tax, and accruals for penalties and interest on uncertain tax positions. In the future we may choose to divest of certain operating assets that have little or no tax basis, thereby resulting in a higher taxable gain than otherwise would be recognized. The higher taxable gain will increase our effective rate in the quarter in which the divestiture is consummated. We made income tax payments (net of refunds received) of $173 million, $418 million and $444 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Income taxes paid in 2011 reflect the favorable tax depreciation provisions of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010 (Tax Relief Act) that was signed into law in December 2010 (Bonus Depreciation). The Tax Relief Act included 100% Bonus Depreciation for property placed in service after September 8, 2010 and through December 31, 2011 (and for certain long term construction projects to be placed in service in 2012) and 50% Bonus Depreciation for property placed in service in 2012 (and for certain long term construction projects to be placed in service in 2013). We anticipate our cash paid for income taxes for 2012 will be approximately $140 million higher than that of 2011. For additional discussion and detail regarding our income taxes, see Note 10, Income Taxes, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. 43 Table of Contents Reportable Segments Our operations are managed and reviewed through four geographic regions that we designate as our reportable segments. Summary financial information concerning our reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 is shown in the following table (in millions of dollars and as a percentage of revenue): NetRevenue Depletion andAccretion BeforeAdjustments forAsset RetirementObligations AmortizationExpensefor AssetRetirementObligations Depreciation,Amortization,Depletion andAccretion Gain (Loss) onDisposition ofAssets, Netand AssetImpairment OperatingIncome(Loss) OperatingMargin 2011: Eastern $ 2,103.1 $ 214.3 $ (11.9 ) $ 202.4 $ (12.2 ) $ 493.0 23.4 % Midwestern 1,806.5 214.9 (8.4 ) 206.5 (0.2 ) 375.9 20.8 Southern 2,029.9 227.5 2.4 229.9 (11.6 ) 460.7 22.7 Western 2,155.7 223.5 (3.0 ) 220.5 (5.2 ) 486.4 22.6 Corporate entities 97.7 51.0 11.3 62.3 1.1 (263.3 ) Total $ 8,192.9 $ 931.2 $ (9.6 ) $ 921.6 $ (28.1 ) $ 1,552.7 19.0 % 2010: Eastern $ 2,075.5 $ 208.8 $ (3.3 ) $ 205.5 $ (15.0 ) $ 488.4 23.5 % Midwestern 1,766.9 214.2 (10.6 ) 203.6 9.3 402.0 22.8 Southern 1,977.3 225.3 (3.8 ) 221.5 1.8 482.8 24.4 Western 2,188.6 224.2 (6.0 ) 218.2 (0.9 ) 521.2 23.8 Corporate entities 98.3 51.9 13.5 65.4 (14.3 ) (355.3 ) Total $ 8,106.6 $ 924.4 $ (10.2 ) $ 914.2 $ (19.1 ) $ 1,539.1 19.0 % 2009: Eastern $ 2,115.0 $ 215.5 $ (1.2 ) $ 214.3 $ 4.0 $ 483.0 22.8 % Midwestern 1,777.0 227.3 (1.4 ) 225.9 27.1 367.3 20.7 Southern 2,046.2 241.9 (8.8 ) 233.1 29.8 522.9 25.6 Western 2,170.0 228.5 6.4 234.9 88.1 582.0 26.8 Corporate entities 90.9 50.4 (0.1 ) 50.3 (12.0 ) (365.4 ) Total $ 8,199.1 $ 963.6 $ (5.1 ) $ 958.5 $ 137.0 $ 1,589.8 19.4 % Corporate entities include legal, tax, treasury, information technology, risk management, human resources, closed landfills, and other typical administrative functions. National Accounts revenue included in corporate entities represents the portion of revenue generated from nationwide contracts in markets outside our operating areas, where the associated waste handling services are subcontracted to local operators. Consequently, substantially all of this revenue is offset with related subcontract costs, which are recorded in cost of operations. Significant changes in the revenue and operating margins of our reportable segments comparing 2011 to 2010 and 2010 to 2009 are discussed in the following paragraphs. The results of our reportable segments were also affected by the disposition of certain assets and liabilities, as required by the DOJ in connection with the Allied acquisition, and in the normal course of business. 2011 compared to 2010 Eastern Region Revenue for 2011 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business, except residential collection, and an increase in commodity recycling revenue. Volume increases in our residential collection and landfill lines of business also helped to increase our revenue. 44 Table of Contents Operating margins were 23.4% in 2011 versus 23.5% in 2010. The decrease in operating margins is due primarily to higher fuel, commodities and sales and marketing costs. These unfavorable items were partially offset by the favorable adjustments to landfill amortization expense for asset retirement obligations of $11.9 million in 2011 compared to a favorable adjustment of $3.3 million in 2010. Operating margins for 2011 also were impacted by lower disposal, subcontract and transportation costs as a result of a decline in subcontracted volumes and a lower loss on the disposition of assets and impairments. Midwestern Region Revenue for 2011 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business and an increase in recycling commodity revenue. These increases were offset by volume declines in our residential collection, transfer station and disposal lines of business, in part due to the expiration of the City of Toronto transportation and disposal contract. Operating margins were 20.8% in 2011 versus 22.8% in 2010. The decrease in operating margins is due primarily to the gain on disposition of assets of $9.3 million in 2010 compared to a loss of $0.2 million in 2011. Operating margins were also impacted by higher fuel costs and costs of commodities sold as well as sales and marketing costs and legal settlements. These decreases were partially offset by lower disposal, subcontract and transportation costs primarily due to the expiration of the City of Toronto contract. Southern Region Revenue for 2011 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business, except residential collection and transfer station, an increase in landfill volume and an increase in recycling commodity revenue. These increases were partially offset by volume declines in our commercial and residential collection lines of business. Operating margins were 22.7% in 2011 versus 24.4% in 2010. The decrease in operating margins is due primarily to the early closure of a landfill resulting in an impairment charge of $28.7 million. The impairment was partially offset by a gain of $17.2 million relating to the disposition of businesses in three markets during the second quarter of 2011. Operating margins were also impacted by unfavorable adjustments to landfill amortization expense for asset retirement obligations of $2.4 million in 2011 compared to a favorable adjustment of $3.8 million in 2010. Additionally, operating margins were impacted by higher fuel, commodities and sales and marketing costs, partially offset by lower disposal costs, during 2011 versus 2010. Western Region Revenue for 2011 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business and an increase in recycling commodity revenues. The increases were partially offset by volume declines in all lines of business, primarily due to the expiration of our San Mateo County contract. Operating margins were 22.6% in 2011 versus 23.8% in 2010. The decrease in operating margins is due primarily to the losses on dispositions of assets and impairments during 2011 of $5.2 million from the divestiture of a business versus $0.9 million for 2010 and higher fuel costs in 2011. Additionally, in 2010, there was a favorable $6.0 million adjustment to landfill amortization expense for asset retirement obligations. These decreases were partially offset by lower labor, benefit and disposal costs due to the expiration of our San Mateo County contract. Corporate Entities Operating loss improved $91.9 million in 2011 versus 2010. During 2010, we incurred $33.3 million of incremental costs to achieve our synergy plan and $11.4 million of restructuring and integration charges related to our acquisition of Allied. Operating margins for 2010 also were impacted by higher litigation and management incentive plan costs. Additionally, during 2011 we recorded a gain on the disposition of assets and impairments of $1.1 million versus an impairment loss of $14.4 million related to certain long lived assets that were held and used for 2010. 45 Table of Contents 2010 compared to 2009 Eastern Region Revenue for 2010 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business. However, the increase in revenue from core price was more than offset by volume declines in our collection and transfer station lines of business while our landfill line of business reflected a modest increase. 2010 includes revenue of $20.8 million associated with divested locations. 2009 includes revenue of $61.9 million associated with divested locations. Excluding the effect of the divested revenue, revenue increased $1.6 million for 2010 versus 2009. Operating margins were 23.5% in 2010 versus 22.8% in 2009. The increase in operating margins is due primarily to lower labor, benefits, disposal, transportation, repair and maintenance expenses as a result of lower volumes and cost control measures. Operating margins for 2010 also were impacted by lower risk insurance costs. These increases were partially offset by the loss on the disposition of assets of $15.0 million in 2010 compared to the gain of $4.0 million in 2009 and by higher fuel costs and costs of commodities sold in 2010. We also recorded a $12.0 million recovery of insurance proceeds related to remediation costs at the Countywide facility that reduced our landfill operating costs during the third quarter of 2009. Midwestern Region Revenue for 2010 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business except landfill. While price associated with municipal solid waste volumes increased during 2010, this increase was offset by a higher mix of special waste volumes. However, the increase in revenue from core price for 2010 was more than offset by volume declines in our collection and transfer station lines of business. Landfill volumes increased for 2010 primarily due to special waste event driven work. 2010 includes revenues of $22.5 million associated with divested locations. 2009 includes revenue of $31.5 million associated with divested locations. Excluding the effect of the divested revenue, revenue decreased $1.1 million for 2010 versus 2009. Operating margins were 22.8% in 2010 versus 20.7% in 2009. The increase in operating margins is due primarily to lower labor, benefits, disposal, transportation, and repair and maintenance expenses as a result of lower volumes and cost control measures. Operating margins for 2010 also were impacted by lower risk insurance costs and a favorable adjustment to amortization expense for asset retirement obligations of $10.6 million in 2010 compared to a favorable adjustment of $1.4 million in 2009. These increases were partially offset by the lower gain on the disposition of assets of $9.3 million in 2010 compared to a gain of $27.1 million in 2009 and higher fuel costs and costs of commodities sold in 2010. Southern Region Revenue for 2010 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business except transfer station. However, the increase in revenue from core price was more than offset by volume declines, especially in our collection and landfill lines of business. Contributing to the decline in revenue for 2009 was $30.4 million of revenue associated with divested locations. Excluding the effect of the divested revenue, revenue decreased $38.5 million for 2010 versus 2009. Operating margins were 24.4% in 2010 versus 25.6% in 2009. The decrease in operating margins is due primarily to the gain on disposition of assets of $1.8 million in the 2010 period compared to the gain of $29.8 million in 2009. Operating margins for 2010 also were impacted by higher fuel costs and costs of commodities sold. These decreases were partially offset by lower labor, benefits, disposal and repair and maintenance expenses as a result of lower volumes and cost control measures and lower risk insurance costs. Western Region Revenue for 2010 benefited from core price growth in all lines of business. However, the increase in revenue from core price was more than offset by volume declines, especially in our collection and transfer station lines of 46 Table of Contents business. Landfill volumes in 2010 increased primarily due to special waste event driven work. 2009 includes revenues of $11.0 million associated with divested locations. Excluding the divested revenue, revenue increased $29.6 million for 2010 versus 2009. Operating margins were 23.8% in 2010 versus 26.8% in 2009. The decrease in operating margins is primarily attributed to the loss on disposition of assets of $0.9 million in 2010 compared to the gain of $88.1 million in 2009. Operating margins for 2010 also were impacted by higher fuel costs and costs of commodities sold. These decreases were partially offset by lower risk insurance costs and a favorable adjustment to amortization expense for asset retirement obligations of $6.0 million in 2010 compared to an unfavorable adjustment of $6.4 million in 2009. We also recorded a $5.2 million remediation charge in 2009 related to environmental conditions at our closed disposal facility in California. Corporate Entities The changes in net revenue relates to our National Accounts program. Included in our gain (loss) on disposition of assets and impairments, net, for 2010 and 2009 are transaction related expenses from the disposition of assets in our other segments. Additionally, during 2010 we recorded an impairment loss of $14.4 million related to certain long lived assets that are held and used. Landfill and Environmental Matters Our landfill costs include daily operating expenses, costs of capital for cell development, costs for final capping, closure and post closure, and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance. Daily operating expenses include leachate treatment and disposal, methane gas and groundwater monitoring and system maintenance, interim cap maintenance, and costs associated with applying daily cover materials. We expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred. We use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs related to landfill development. In life cycle accounting, certain direct costs are capitalized and charged to depletion expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. These costs include all costs to acquire and construct a site, including excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas collection and monitoring systems, installation of groundwater monitoring wells, and other costs associated with the acquisition and development of the site. Obligations associated with final capping, closure and post closure are capitalized and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed. Cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers. These estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to adjust the rates we use to expense capitalized costs. Changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in costs, available airspace, inflation and applicable regulations. Changes in available airspace include changes in engineering estimates, changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe have a probable likelihood of being permitted. 47 Table of Contents Available Airspace The following tables reflect landfill airspace activity for active landfills owned or operated by us for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009: Balanceas ofDecember 31,2010 NewExpansionsUndertaken LandfillsAcquired,Net ofDivestitures PermitsGranted,Net ofClosures AirspaceConsumed ChangesinEngineeringEstimates Balanceas ofDecember 31,2011 Cubic yards (in millions): Permitted airspace 4,595.5 7.9 98.1 (79.9 ) 0.2 4,621.8 Probable expansion airspace 149.1 69.4 (52.1 ) 0.1 166.5 Total cubic yards (in millions) 4,744.6 69.4 7.9 46.0 (79.9 ) 0.3 4,788.3 Number of sites: Permitted airspace 193 1 (3 ) 191 Probable expansion airspace 8 4 (4 ) 8 Balanceas ofDecember 31,2009 NewExpansionsUndertaken LandfillsAcquired,Net ofDivestitures PermitsGranted,Net ofClosures AirspaceConsumed ChangesinEngineeringEstimates Balanceas ofDecember 31,2010 Cubic yards (in millions): Permitted airspace 4,436.4 15.3 222.6 (84.3 ) 5.5 4,595.5 Probable expansion airspace 212.5 29.8 (93.1 ) (0.1 ) 149.1 Total cubic yards (in millions) 4,648.9 29.8 15.3 129.5 (84.3 ) 5.4 4,744.6 Number of sites: Permitted airspace 192 3 (2 ) 193 Probable expansion airspace 12 2 (6 ) 8 Balanceas ofDecember 31,2008 NewExpansionsUndertaken LandfillsAcquired,Net ofDivestitures PermitsGranted,Net ofClosures AirspaceConsumed ChangesinEngineeringEstimates Balanceas ofDecember 31,2009 Cubic yards (in millions): Permitted airspace 4,559.6 (176.8 ) 134.2 (86.9 ) 6.3 4,436.4 Probable expansion airspace 386.2 22.4 (62.2 ) (133.2 ) (0.7 ) 212.5 Total cubic yards (in millions) 4,945.8 22.4 (239.0 ) 1.0 (86.9 ) 5.6 4,648.9 Number of sites: Permitted airspace 213 (9 ) (12 ) 192 Probable expansion airspace 23 1 (1 ) (11 ) 12 48 Table of Contents Changes in engineering estimates typically include modifications to the available disposal capacity of a landfill based on a refinement of the capacity calculations resulting from updated information. Changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfills footprint or vertical slopes. As of December 31, 2011, we owned or operated 191 active solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be 4.8 billion in place cubic yards. Total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace. Engineers develop these estimates at least annually using information provided by annual aerial surveys. As of December 31, 2011, total available disposal capacity is estimated to be 4.6 billion in place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 0.2 billion in place cubic yards of probable expansion airspace. Before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and, therefore, included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity, it must meet all of our expansion criteria. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, and Note 8, Landfill and Environmental Costs, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information. As of December 31, 2011, eight of our landfills met all of our criteria for including their probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity. At projected annual volumes, these landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of 53 years, including probable expansion airspace. The average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is 61 years. We have other expansion opportunities that are not included in our total available airspace because they do not meet all of our criteria for probable expansion airspace. The following table reflects the estimated operating lives of our active landfill sites based on available and probable disposal capacity using current annual volumes as of December 31, 2011: Numberof SiteswithoutProbableExpansionAirspace Numberof SiteswithProbableExpansionAirspace TotalSites PercentofTotal 0 to 5 years 12 12 6.3 % 6 to 10 years 21 21 11.0 11 to 20 years 34 1 35 18.3 21 to 40 years 51 2 53 27.7 41+ years 65 5 70 36.7 Total 183 8 191 100.0 % Final Capping, Closure and Post Closure Costs As of December 31, 2011, accrued final capping, closure and post closure costs were $1,037.0 million, of which $85.2 million is current and $951.8 million is long term as reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill and environmental costs. Remediation and Other Charges for Landfill Matters In December 2009, we finalized our purchase price allocation for the environmental liabilities we assumed as part of the Allied acquisition. These liabilities represent our estimate of costs to remediate sites that were previously owned or operated by Allied or sites at which Allied, or a predecessor company that it had acquired, had been identified as a potentially responsible party. The remediation of these sites is in various stages of completion from having received an initial notice from a regulatory agency and commencing investigation to being in the final stages of post remedial monitoring. See also Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Environmental Remediation Liabilities, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K for further information. We have 49 Table of Contents recorded these liabilities at their estimated fair values using a discount rate of 9.75%. Discounted liabilities are accreted to interest expense through the period that they are paid. The following is a discussion of certain of our significant remediation matters: Countywide Landfill. In September 2009, Republic Services of Ohio II, LLC entered into Final Findings and Orders with the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency that require us to implement a comprehensive operation and maintenance program to manage the remediation area at the Countywide Recycling and Disposal Facility (Countywide). The remediation liability for Countywide recorded as of December 31, 2011 is $56.8 million, of which $5.0 million is expected to be paid during 2012. We believe the reasonably possible range of loss for remediation costs is $53 million to $74 million. Congress Landfill. In August 2010, Congress Development Company agreed with the State of Illinois to have a Final Consent Order (Final Order) entered by the Circuit Court of Illinois, Cook County. Pursuant to the Final Order, we have agreed to continue to implement certain remedial activities at the Congress Landfill. The remediation liability recorded as of December 31, 2011 is $83.6 million, of which $7.4 million is expected to be paid during 2012. We believe the reasonably possible range of loss for remediation costs is $53 million to $154 million.

Our compaction rates may improve as a result of the settlement and decomposition of waste. As of December 31, 2011, we expect to spend an estimated additional $6.5 billion on existing landfills, primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures, over their expected remaining lives. Our total expected investment, excluding non depletable land, estimated to be $9.8 billion, or $2.04 per cubic yard, is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based on airspace consumed using the units of consumption method.

The following table summarizes our cash flow from operating activities, investing activities and financing activities for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 1,766.7 $ 1,433.7 $ 1,396.5 Net cash used in investing activities (950.2 ) (690.5 ) (242.5 ) Net cash used in financing activities (838.5 ) (702.9 ) (1,174.7 ) Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities Certain of the more significant items affecting our operating cash flows for 2011 and 2010 are summarized below: Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures. Changes in assets and liabilities decreased our cash flow from operations by $403.3 million in 2011 versus a decrease of $360.9 million in 2010, an increase of $42.4 million, primarily as a result of the following: At December 31, 2011 and 2010, we recorded a tax receivable of $68.4 million and $69.8 million, respectively primarily due to the effects of current deductions for property placed into service during the fourth quarter, and referred to as Bonus Depreciation. We expect a refund of approximately $50 million in the first quarter of 2012. During 2011, our cash paid for taxes, net of refunds for bonus depreciation, was approximately $173 million. During 2010, we made income tax payments (net of refunds received) of approximately $418 million, of which approximately $111 million related to the settlement of certain tax liabilities regarding BFI risk management companies. During 2011, we paid $150.7 million to settle capping, closure, post closure and remediation obligations, a decrease of $11.1 million from the $161.8 million paid in 2010. The decrease in cash paid for capping, closure, and post closure and remediation activities is primarily due to the timing of obligations. During 2011, we paid $3.0 million for restructuring and synergy related costs incurred in connection with the restructuring plan related to the Allied acquisition, a decrease of $17.0 million from the $20.0 million paid in 2010. The decrease in cash expenditures is due to a decrease in restructuring and synergy plan activities in 2011. Cash paid for interest was $21.6 million lower during 2011 versus 2010 due to reductions in debt balances and the refinancing of our higher interest rate debt in the second half of 2009, throughout 2010 and 2011. The most significant items affecting our operating cash flows for 2010 and 2009 are summarized below: 53 Table of Contents Changes in assets and liabilities, net of effects from business acquisitions and divestitures. Changes in assets and liabilities decreased our cash flow from operations by $360.9 million in 2010 versus a decrease of $251.9 million in 2009, an increase of $109.0 million, primarily as a result of the following: During the fourth quarter of 2010, we recorded a tax receivable of approximately $70 million primarily due to the effects of current deductions for property placed into service during the fourth quarter, referred to as Bonus Depreciation. During 2010, we paid $161.8 million to settle capping, closure, post closure and remediation obligations, an increase of $4.7 million from the $157.1 million we paid in 2009. The increase in cash paid for capping, closure, and post closure and remediation activities is primarily due to the timing of obligations. During 2010, we paid $20.0 million for restructuring and synergy related costs incurred in connection with the restructuring plan related to the Allied acquisition, a decrease of $46.5 million from the $66.5 million we paid in 2009. The decrease in cash expenditures is due to a decrease in restructuring and synergy plan activities in 2010. During 2010, we made income tax payments (net of refunds received) of approximately $418 million, of which approximately $111 million related to the settlement of certain tax liabilities regarding BFI risk management companies. During 2009, we made income tax payments (net of refunds received) of approximately $444 million, of which approximately $105 million related to taxes on our divestitures. Cash paid for interest was $53.8 million lower during 2010 versus 2009 due to reductions in debt balances and the refinancing of our higher interest rate debt in the second half of 2009 and throughout 2010. Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities The most significant items affecting the comparison of our investing cash flows for the periods presented are summarized below: Capital expenditures. Capital expenditures during 2011 were $936.5 million, compared with $794.7 million in 2010 and $826.3 million in 2009. Property and equipment received during 2011 was $885.7 million. Proceeds from sales of property and equipment. Proceeds from sales of property and equipment during 2011 were $34.6 million, compared with $37.4 million in 2010 and $31.8 million in 2009. Proceeds from sales of property and equipment in 2010 were higher than 2009 due to the sale of our former headquarters building in Florida. Cash used in acquisitions and development projects, net of cash acquired. During 2011 we paid $42.6 million for acquisitions, including one landfill privatization, one recycling business and a variety of collection businesses. During 2010, we paid $58.9 million for acquisitions, including a landfill development project. In addition, during 2011 we paid $3.1 million in relation to holdback liabilities resulting from acquisitions. Such holdback related disbursements were $0.6 million in 2010 and 2009. Proceeds from divestitures. Proceeds from divestitures (net of cash divested) and other sales of assets were $14.2 million in 2011, $60.0 million in 2010, and $511.1 million in 2009. Proceeds received in 2011 were primarily related to certain hauling and transfer station assets sold in Southern California and New England markets as well as three markets in our Southern region. Proceeds received in 2010 primarily related to certain hauling and transfer station assets sold in our Eastern Region. Proceeds received in 2009 were primarily the result of divesting certain assets as required by the DOJ as a condition of the Allied acquisition. Change in restricted cash and marketable securities. Investments in our restricted cash and marketable securities balances, which are related to the issuance of tax exempt bonds for our capital needs, collateral for certain of our 54 Table of Contents obligations and amounts held in trust as a guarantee of performance, increased by $16.8 million during 2011 thus increasing cash used in investing activities. Changes in our restricted cash and marketable securities balances contributed $66.3 million and $41.6 million to our investing activities in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Funds received from issuances of tax exempt bonds are deposited directly into trust accounts by the bonding authority at the time of issuance. As we do not have the ability to use these funds for general operating purposes, they are classified as restricted cash in our consolidated balance sheets. Proceeds from bond issuances into restricted trust accounts represent cash used in investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Reimbursements from the trust for qualifying expenditures are presented as cash provided by investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand, restricted cash held for capital expenditures, cash flows from operations, our revolving credit facilities, and tax exempt bonds and other financings. We expect to use primarily cash for future business acquisitions. Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities The most significant items affecting the comparison of our cash flows from financing activities for the periods presented are summarized below: Net debt repayments or borrowings. Proceeds from notes payable and long term debt and issuance of senior notes net of payments of notes payable and long term debt were $36.8 million in 2011 versus net payments of $397.4 million in 2010 and $865.9 million in 2009. For a more detailed discussion, see our Financial Condition section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. Premiums and fees paid to issue and retire senior notes. Cash premiums and fees paid in connection with the issuance of our 2011 Notes, premiums paid for note redemptions and fees paid to issue tax exempt indebtedness and to settle certain hedging relationships were $148.4 million during 2011. Cash premiums and fees paid in connection with the issuance of our 2010 Notes, premiums paid for note redemptions and fees paid to issue tax exempt indebtedness and to settle certain hedging relationships were $56.6 million during 2010. In connection with the issuance of our senior notes as well as purchasing and retiring certain indebtedness in 2009, we incurred cash premiums and fees totaling $61.6 million. Purchase of common stock for treasury. In August 2011, our board of directors approved a share repurchase program pursuant to which we may repurchase up to $750 million of our outstanding shares of common stock through December 31, 2013. This authorization is in addition to the $400 million repurchase program authorized in November 2010. From November 2010 to December 31, 2011, we repurchased 17.1 million shares of our stock for $500.8 million at a weighted average cost per share of $29.21. During 2011 we repurchased 15.7 million shares for $459.7 million at a weighted average cost per share of $29.28. During 2010 we repurchased 1.4 million shares for $41.1 million at a weighted average cost per share of $28.46. Cash dividends paid. We initiated a quarterly cash dividend in July 2003. The dividend has been increased from time to time thereafter. In July 2011, the board of directors approved an increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.22 per share. Dividends paid were $309.4 million, $294.6 million, and $288.3 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Financial Condition Cash and Cash Equivalents As of December 31, 2011, we had $66.3 million of cash and cash equivalents, and $189.6 million of restricted cash deposits and restricted marketable securities, including $22.5 million of restricted cash and marketable securities held for capital expenditures under certain debt facilities. 55 Table of Contents Credit Facilities In April 2011, we amended and restated our $1.0 billion revolving credit facility due April 2012 (the Amended and Restated Credit Facility) to increase the borrowing capacity to $1.25 billion and to extend the maturity to April 2016. The Amended and Restated Credit Facility includes a feature that allows us to increase availability, at our option, by an aggregate amount up to $500 million, through increased commitments from existing lenders or the addition of new lenders. At our option, borrowings under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility bear interest at a Base Rate, or a Eurodollar Rate, plus an applicable margin based on our Debt Ratings (all as defined in the agreements). Substantially all of our subsidiaries guarantee all obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Facility. Contemporaneous with the execution of the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, we entered into Amendment No. 2 to our existing $1.75 billion credit facility (the Existing Credit Facility and, together with the Amended and Restated Credit Facility, the Credit Facilities), to reduce the commitments under the Existing Credit Facility to $1.25 billion and conform certain terms of the Existing Credit Facility to those of the Amended and Restated Credit Facility. Amendment No. 2 does not extend the maturity date under the Existing Credit Facility, which matures in September 2013. Substantially all of our subsidiaries continue to guarantee all obligations under the Existing Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, the interest rate for our borrowings under our Credit Facilities was 3.25% and 1.56%, respectively. Our Credit Facilities also are subject to facility fees based on applicable rates defined in the agreements and the aggregate commitments, regardless of usage. Availability under our Credit Facilities can be used for working capital, capital expenditures, letters of credit and other general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, we had $34.4 million and $75.0 million of Base Rate Prime and Eurodollar Rate borrowings, respectively. We had $950.2 million and $1,037.5 million of letters of credit using availability under our Credit Facilities, leaving $1,515.4 million and $1,637.5 million of availability under our Credit Facilities, at December 31, 2011 and December 31, 2010, respectively. The agreements governing our Credit Facilities require us to comply with certain financial and other covenants. We may pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants. Compliance with these covenants is a condition for any incremental borrowings under our Credit Facilities and failure to meet these covenants would enable the lenders to require repayment of any outstanding loans (which would adversely affect our liquidity). At December 31, 2011, our EBITDA to interest ratio was 5.25 compared to the 3.00 minimum required by the covenants, and our total debt to EBITDA ratio was 2.99 compared to the 3.50 maximum allowed by the covenants. At December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with the covenants of the Credit Facilities, and we expect to be in compliance throughout 2012. EBITDA, which is a non GAAP measure, is calculated as defined in our Credit Facility agreements. In this context, EBITDA is used solely to provide information regarding the extent to which we are in compliance with debt covenants and is not comparable to EBITDA used by other companies or used by us for other purposes. We intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments, share repurchases and debt repayments. Debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise. We believe that our excess cash, cash from operating activities and our availability to draw from our Credit Facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due. In the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings. Early extinguishment of debt will result in an impairment charge in the period in which the debt is repaid. The loss on early extinguishment of debt relates to premiums paid to effectuate the repurchase and the relative portion of unamortized note discounts and debt issue costs. 56 Table of Contents Senior Notes and Debentures During 2011, 2010 and 2009, we completed financing transactions that resulted in cash paid for premiums and professional fees to repurchase debt as well as the non cash write off of unamortized debt discounts and deferred issuance costs. For a more detailed discussion, see our Loss on Extinguishment of Debt section of this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. In August 2011, our 6.750% senior notes matured. We used cash on hand and incremental borrowings under our Credit Facilities to repay $387.0 million of principal due on these notes. In May 2011, we issued $700.0 million of 3.800% senior notes due 2018 (the 3.800% Notes), $550.0 million of 4.750% senior notes due 2023 (the 4.750% Notes) and $600.0 million of 5.700% senior notes due 2041 (the 5.700% Notes and, together with the 3.800% Notes and the 4.750% Notes, the 2011 Notes). The 2011 Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of our subsidiary guarantors. We used the net proceeds from the 2011 Notes as follows: (i) $621.4 million to fund the redemption of our $600.0 million 7.125% senior notes maturing in 2016; (ii) $81.6 million to purchase $59.2 million of our subsidiary Browning Ferris Industries, LLCs 9.250% debentures maturing in 2021; (iii) $221.8 million to purchase $180.7 million of our subsidiary Browning Ferris Industries, LLCs 7.400% debentures maturing in 2035; (iv) $619.0 million to repay borrowings under our Credit Facilities; and (v) the remainder for general corporate purposes. In May 2011, our 6.375% senior notes matured. We used cash on hand and incremental borrowings under our Credit Facilities to repay $216.9 million of principal due on these notes. In February 2011, our 5.750% senior notes matured. We used cash on hand and incremental borrowings under our Credit Facilities to repay $262.9 million of principal due on these notes. In November 2010, our 6.50% senior notes matured. We used cash on hand and incremental borrowings under our Credit Facilities to repay $221.6 million of principal due on these notes. In March 2010, we issued $850.0 million of 5.00% senior notes due 2020 (the 2020 Notes), with an unamortized discount of $0.1 million at December 31, 2010, and $650.0 million of 6.20% senior notes due 2040 (the 2040 Notes, and, together with the 2020 Notes, the 2010 Notes). The 2010 Notes are general senior unsecured obligations of our subsidiary guarantors. We used the net proceeds from the 2010 Notes as follows: (i) $433.7 million to redeem the 6.125% senior notes due 2014 at a premium of 102.042% ($425.0 million principal outstanding); (ii) $621.8 million to redeem the 7.250% senior notes due 2015 at a premium of 103.625% ($600.0 million principal outstanding); and (iii) the remainder to reduce amounts outstanding under our Credit Facilities and for general corporate purposes. During the first quarter of 2010, we incurred a loss of $132.1 million for premiums paid to repurchase debt, to write off unamortized debt discounts and for professional fees paid to effectuate the repurchase of the senior notes. Tax Exempt Financings As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had $1,126.4 million and $1,151.8 million, respectively, of fixed and variable rate tax exempt financings outstanding with maturities ranging from 2012 to 2035. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the total of the unamortized adjustment to fair value recorded in purchase accounting for the tax exempt financings assumed from Allied was $15.8 million and $21.9 million, respectively, which is being amortized to interest expense over the remaining terms of the debt. Approximately 75% of our tax exempt financings are remarketed quarterly, weekly or daily by a remarketing agent to effectively maintain a variable yield. Certain of these variable rate tax exempt financings are credit enhanced with letters of credit having terms in excess of one year issued by banks with investment grade credit ratings. The holders of the bonds can put them back to the remarketing agent at the end of each interest period. To date, the remarketing agents have been able to remarket our variable rate unsecured tax exempt bonds. These bonds have been classified as long term because of our ability and intent to refinance them using availability under our Credit Facilities, if necessary. 57 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2011, we had $189.6 million of restricted cash and marketable securities, of which $22.5 million represented proceeds from the issuance of tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings and will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements. Restricted cash and marketable securities also include amounts held in trust as a financial guarantee of our performance. Fuel Hedges We use derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in diesel fuel prices. We have entered into multiple agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases. The agreements qualified for, and were designated as, effective hedges of changes in the prices of forecasted diesel fuel purchases (fuel hedges). For a detailed listing of our outstanding fuel hedges during 2011 and 2010, see Note 15, Financial Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The aggregated fair values of our outstanding fuel hedges at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were current assets of $1.6 million, and current liabilities of $4.7 million and $1.9 million, respectively, and have been recorded in other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, respectively. The effective portions of the changes in fair values as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, net of tax, of $1.8 million and $0.2 million, respectively, have been recorded in stockholders equity as components of accumulated other comprehensive income. During 2011, approximately 4% of our fuel volume purchases were hedged with swap agreements. Additionally, we were able to recover approximately 68% of our fuel costs with fuel recovery fees from certain of our customers. Recycling Commodity Hedges Revenue from sale of recycling commodities is primarily from sales of old corrugated cardboard (OCC) and old newspaper (ONP). We use derivative instruments such as swaps and costless collars designated as cash flow hedges to manage our exposure to changes in prices of these commodities. We have entered into multiple agreements related to the forecasted OCC and ONP sales. The agreements qualified for, and were designated as, effective hedges of changes in the prices of certain forecasted recycling commodity sales (recycling commodity hedges). For a detailed listing of our outstanding recycling commodity hedges during 2011 and 2010, see Note 15, Financial Instruments, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. The aggregated fair values of the outstanding recycling commodity hedges at December 31, 2011 and 2010 were current assets of $1.4 million and $1.9 million, respectively, and current liabilities of $0.7 million and $6.5 million, respectively, and have been recorded in other current assets and other accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, respectively. The effective portions of the changes in fair values of our recycling commodity hedges as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, net of tax, of $0.4 million and $(2.6) million have been recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Approximately 33% of our 2011 sales volume of commodities was subject to cash flow hedges. 58 Table of Contents Contractual Obligations The following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of December 31, 2011 (in millions): Year Ending December 31, OperatingLeases Maturities ofNotes Payable,Capital Leasesand Other Long Term Debt Final Capping,Closure andPost Closure Remediation UnconditionalPurchaseCommitments DefinedBenefitPensionPlan Total 2012 $ 28.4 $ 30.7 $ 85.2 $ 99.0 $ 196.8 $ 24.4 $ 464.5 2013 24.8 32.7 111.0 64.3 80.0 20.7 333.5 2014 18.5 16.0 97.0 45.7 68.1 21.9 267.2 2015 15.3 25.7 98.7 37.7 31.7 21.2 230.3 2016 13.5 21.7 94.3 32.6 25.3 21.9 209.3 Thereafter 61.0 6,965.4 4,628.9 458.7 242.4 113.7 12,470.1 Total $ 161.5 $ 7,092.2 $ 5,115.1 $ 738.0 $ 644.3 $ 223.8 $ 13,974.9 We intend to use excess cash on hand and cash from operating activities to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, dividend payments, share repurchases and debt repayments. Actual debt repayments may include purchases of our outstanding indebtedness in the secondary market or otherwise. We believe that our excess cash, cash from operating activities and proceeds from our revolving credit facilities provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and maturing obligations as they come due. In the future we may choose to voluntarily retire certain portions of our outstanding debt before their maturity dates using cash from operations or additional borrowings. We also may explore opportunities in the capital markets to fund redemptions should market conditions be favorable. The present value of capital lease obligations is included in our consolidated balance sheets. The estimated remaining final capping, closure and post closure and remediation expenditures presented above are not inflated or discounted and reflect the estimated future payments for liabilities incurred and recorded as of December 31, 2011. Unconditional purchase commitments consist primarily of (i) disposal related agreements which include fixed or minimum royalty payments, host agreements and take or pay and put or pay agreements and (ii) other obligations including committed capital expenditures and consulting service agreements. Debt covenants Our Credit Facilities contain financial covenants. We can pay dividends and repurchase common stock if we are in compliance with these covenants. At December 31, 2011, we were in compliance with all financial and other covenants under our Credit Facilities. We were also in compliance with the non financial covenants in the indentures relating to our senior notes as of December 31, 2011. We expect to be in compliance with our covenants during 2012. Failure to comply with the financial and other covenants under our Credit Facilities, as well as the occurrence of certain material adverse events, would constitute defaults and would allow the lenders under our Credit Facilities to accelerate the maturity of all indebtedness under the related agreements. This could also have an adverse impact on the availability of financial assurances. In addition, maturity acceleration on our Credit Facilities constitutes an event of default under our other debt instruments, including our senior notes, and, therefore, our senior notes would also be subject to acceleration of maturity. If such acceleration were to occur, we would not have sufficient liquidity available to repay the indebtedness. We would likely have to seek an amendment under 59 Table of Contents our Credit Facilities for relief from the financial covenants or repay the debt with proceeds from the issuance of new debt or equity, or asset sales, if necessary. We may be unable to amend our Credit Facilities or raise sufficient capital to repay such obligations in the event the maturities are accelerated. Financial assurance We must provide financial assurance to governmental agencies and a variety of other entities under applicable environmental regulations relating to our landfill operations for capping, closure and post closure costs, and related to our performance under certain collection, landfill and transfer station contracts. We satisfy these financial assurance requirements by providing surety bonds, letters of credit, or insurance policies (the Financial Assurance Instruments), or trust deposits which are included in restricted cash and marketable securities. The amount of the financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and post closure costs is determined by applicable state environmental regulations. The financial assurance requirements for capping, closure and post closure costs may be associated with a portion of the landfill or the entire landfill. Generally, states require a third party engineering specialist to determine the estimated capping, closure and post closure costs that are used to determine the required amount of financial assurance for a landfill. The amount of financial assurance required can, and generally will, differ from the obligation determined and recorded under U.S. GAAP. The amount of the financial assurance requirements related to contract performance varies by contract. Additionally, we must provide financial assurance for our insurance program and collateral for certain performance obligations. We do not expect a material increase in financial assurance requirements during 2011, although the mix of financial assurance instruments may change. These financial instruments are issued in the normal course of business and are not considered company indebtedness. Because we currently have no liability for the Financial Assurance Instruments, they are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheets. However, we record capping, closure and post closure liabilities and self insurance liabilities as they are incurred. The underlying obligations of the financial assurance instruments, in excess of those already reflected in our consolidated balance sheets, would be recorded if it is probable that we would be unable to fulfill our related obligations. We do not expect this to occur. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements We have no off balance sheet debt or similar obligations, other than financial assurance instruments and operating leases, that are not classified as debt. We do not guarantee any third party debt. Free Cash Flow We define free cash flow, which is not a measure determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment, plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment as presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows. Our free cash flow for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 is calculated as follows (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Cash provided by operating activities $ 1,766.7 $ 1,433.7 $ 1,396.5 Purchases of property and equipment (936.5 ) (794.7 ) (826.3 ) Proceeds from sales of property and equipment 34.6 37.4 31.8 Free cash flow $ 864.8 $ 676.4 $ 602.0 For a discussion of the changes in the components of free cash flow, you should read our discussion regarding Cash Flows Provided By Operating Activities and Cash Flows Used In Investing Activities contained elsewhere in this Form 10 K. 60 Table of Contents Purchases of property and equipment as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows and as presented in the free cash flow table above represent amounts paid during the period for such expenditures. A reconciliation of property and equipment reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows to property and equipment received during the period for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 is as follows (in millions): 2011 2010 2009 Purchases of property and equipment per the consolidated statements of cash flows $ 936.5 $ 794.7 $ 826.3 Adjustments for property and equipment received during the prior period but paid for in the following period, net (50.8 ) 53.9 36.3 Property and equipment received during the period $ 885.7 $ 848.6 $ 862.6 The adjustments noted above do not affect our net change in cash and cash equivalents as reflected in our consolidated statements of cash flows. We believe that the presentation of free cash flow provides useful information regarding our recurring cash provided by operating activities after expenditures for property and equipment received, plus proceeds from sales of property and equipment. It also demonstrates our ability to execute our financial strategy, which includes reinvesting in existing capital assets to ensure a high level of customer service, investing in capital assets to facilitate growth in our customer base and services provided, maintaining our investment grade rating and minimizing debt, paying cash dividends and repurchasing common stock, and maintaining and improving our market position through business optimization. In addition, free cash flow is a key metric used to determine compensation. The presentation of free cash flow has material limitations. Free cash flow does not represent our cash flow available for discretionary expenditures because it excludes certain expenditures that are required or that we have committed to such as debt service requirements and dividend payments. Our definition of free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. Contingencies For a description of our contingencies, see Note 10, Income Taxes, and Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. Critical Accounting Judgments and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management. The following is a list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows and that may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain. Such critical accounting policies, estimates and judgments are applicable to all of our operating segments. We have noted examples of the residual accounting and business risks inherent in the accounting for these areas. Residual accounting and business risks are defined as the inherent risks that we face after the application of our policies and processes that are generally outside of our control or ability to forecast. Landfill Accounting Landfill operating costs are treated as period expenses and are not discussed further herein. Our landfill assets and liabilities fall into the following two categories, each of which requires accounting judgments and estimates: Landfill development costs that are capitalized as an asset. 61 Table of Contents Landfill retirement obligations relating to our capping, closure and post closure liabilities which result in a corresponding landfill retirement asset. Landfill Development Costs We use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize landfill development costs over the life of the site. In life cycle accounting, all costs to acquire and construct a site are capitalized, and charged to expense based on the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace. Obligations associated with final capping, closure and post closure are also capitalized, and amortized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed. Cost and airspace estimates are developed at least annually by engineers. Site permits. In order to develop, construct and operate a landfill, we must obtain permits from various regulatory agencies at the local, state and federal levels. The permitting process requires an initial site study to determine whether the location is feasible for landfill operations. The initial studies are reviewed by our environmental management group and then submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval. During the development stage we capitalize certain costs that we incur after site selection but before the receipt of all required permits if we believe that it is probable that the site will be permitted. Residual risks: Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may cause changes to the landfill site permitting process. These changes could make it more difficult and costly to obtain and maintain a landfill permit. Studies performed could be inaccurate, which could result in the denial or revocation of a permit and changes to accounting assumptions. Conditions could exist that were not identified in the study, which may make the location not feasible for a landfill and could result in the denial of a permit. Denial or revocation of a permit could impair the recorded value of the landfill asset. Actions by neighboring parties, private citizen groups or others to oppose our efforts to obtain, maintain or expand permits could result in denial, revocation or suspension of a permit, which could adversely impact the economic viability of the landfill and could impair the recorded value of the landfill. As a result of opposition to our obtaining a permit, improved technical information as a project progresses, or changes in the anticipated economics associated with a project, we may decide to reduce the scope of or abandon a project, which could result in an asset impairment. Technical landfill design. Upon receipt of initial regulatory approval, technical landfill designs are prepared. The technical designs, which include the detailed specifications to develop and construct all components of the landfill including the types and quantities of materials that will be required, are reviewed by our environmental management group. The technical designs are submitted to the regulatory agencies for approval. Upon approval of the technical designs, the regulatory agencies issue permits to develop and operate the landfill. Residual risks: Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements may require changes in the landfill technical designs. These changes could make it more difficult and costly to meet new design standards. Technical design requirements, as approved, may need modifications at some future point in time. Technical designs could be inaccurate and could result in increased construction costs, difficulty in obtaining a permit or the use of rates to recognize the amortization of landfill development costs and asset retirement obligations that are not appropriate. 62 Table of Contents Permitted and probable landfill disposal capacity. Included in the technical designs are factors that determine the ultimate disposal capacity of the landfill. These factors include the area over which the landfill will be developed, such as the depth of excavation, the height of the landfill elevation and the angle of the side slope construction. The disposal capacity of the landfill is calculated in cubic yards. This measurement of volume is then converted to a disposal capacity expressed in tons based on a site specific expected density to be achieved over the remaining operating life of the landfill. Residual risks: Estimates of future disposal capacity may change as a result of changes in legislative or regulatory design requirements. The density of waste may vary due to variations in operating conditions, including waste compaction practices, site design, climate and the nature of the waste. Capacity is defined in cubic yards but waste received is measured in tons. The number of tons per cubic yard varies by type of waste and our rate of compaction. Development costs. The types of costs that are detailed in the technical design specifications generally include excavation, natural and synthetic liners, construction of leachate collection systems, installation of methane gas collection systems and monitoring probes, installation of groundwater monitoring wells, construction of leachate management facilities and other costs associated with the development of the site. We review the adequacy of our cost estimates on an annual basis by comparing estimated costs with third party bids or contractual arrangements, reviewing the changes in year over year cost estimates for reasonableness, and comparing our resulting development cost per acre with prior period costs. These development costs, together with any costs incurred to acquire, design and permit the landfill, including capitalized interest, are recorded to the landfill asset on the balance sheet as incurred. Residual risk: Actual future costs of construction materials and third party labor could differ from the costs we have estimated because of the availability of the required materials and labor. Technical designs could be altered due to unexpected operating conditions, regulatory changes or legislative changes. Landfill development asset amortization. In order to match the expense related to the landfill asset with the revenue generated by the landfill operations, we amortize the landfill development asset over its operating life on a per ton basis as waste is accepted at the landfill. The landfill asset is fully amortized at the end of a landfills operating life. The per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of the landfill development asset net book value plus estimated future development costs (as described above) for the landfill by the landfills estimated remaining disposal capacity. The expected future development costs are not inflated or discounted, but rather expressed in nominal dollars. This rate is applied to each ton accepted at the landfill to arrive at amortization expense for the period. Amortization rates are influenced by the original cost basis of the landfill, including acquisition costs, which in turn is determined by geographic location and market values. We secure significant landfill assets through business acquisitions and value them at the time of acquisition based on fair value. Amortization rates are also influenced by site specific engineering and cost factors. Residual risk: Changes in our future development cost estimates or our disposal capacity will normally result in a change in our amortization rates and will impact amortization expense prospectively. An unexpected significant increase in estimated costs or reduction in disposal capacity could affect the ongoing economic viability of the landfill and result in asset impairment. 63 Table of Contents On at least an annual basis, we update the estimates of future development costs and remaining disposal capacity for each landfill. These costs and disposal capacity estimates are reviewed and approved by senior operations management annually. Changes in cost estimates and disposal capacity are reflected prospectively in the landfill amortization rates that are updated annually. Landfill Asset Retirement Obligations We have two types of retirement obligations related to landfills: (1) capping and (2) closure and post closure. Obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event. Obligations related to closure and post closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations are recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire life of the landfill. Landfill retirement obligations are capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units of consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed within the entire landfill, depending on the nature of the obligation. All obligations are initially measured at estimated fair value. Fair value is calculated on a present value basis using an inflation rate and our credit adjusted, risk free rate in effect at the time the liabilities were incurred. Future costs for final capping, closure and post closure are developed at least annually by engineers, and are inflated to future value using estimated future payment dates and inflation rate projections. Landfill capping. As individual areas within each landfill reach capacity, we must cap and close the areas in accordance with the landfill site permit. These requirements are detailed in the technical design of the landfill site process previously described. Closure and post closure. Closure costs are costs incurred after a landfill stops receiving waste, but prior to being certified as closed. After the entire landfill has reached capacity and is certified closed, we must to maintain and monitor the site for a post closure period, which generally extends for 30 years. Costs associated with closure and post closure requirements generally include maintenance of the site, the monitoring of methane gas collection systems and groundwater systems, and other activities that occur after the site has ceased accepting waste. Costs associated with post closure monitoring generally include groundwater sampling, analysis and statistical reports, third party labor associated with gas system operations and maintenance, transportation and disposal of leachate, and erosion control costs related to the final cap. Landfill retirement obligation liabilities and assets. Estimates of the total future costs required to cap, close and monitor the landfill as specified by each landfill permit are updated annually. The estimates include inflation, the specific timing of future cash outflows, and the anticipated waste flow into the capping events. Our cost estimates are inflated to the period of performance using an estimate of inflation, which is updated annually and is based upon the ten year average consumer price index (2.5% in both 2011 and 2010). The present value of the remaining capping costs for specific capping events and the remaining closure and post closure costs for the landfill are recorded as incurred on a per ton basis. These liabilities are incurred as disposal capacity is consumed at the landfill. Capping, closure and post closure liabilities are recorded in layers and discounted using our credit adjusted risk free rate in effect at the time the obligation is incurred (6.0% in 2011 and 5.5% in 2010). Retirement obligations are increased each year to reflect the passage of time by accreting the balance at the weighted average credit adjusted risk free rate that was used to calculate each layer of the recorded liabilities. This accretion is charged to operating expenses. Actual cash expenditures reduce the asset retirement obligation liabilities as they are made. Corresponding retirement obligation assets are recorded for the same value as the additions to the capping, closure and post closure liabilities. The retirement obligation assets are amortized to expense on a per ton basis 64 Table of Contents as disposal capacity is consumed. The per ton rate is calculated by dividing the sum of each of the recorded retirement obligation assets net book value and expected future additions to the retirement obligation asset by the remaining disposal capacity. A per ton rate is determined for each separate capping event based on the disposal capacity relating to that event. Closure and post closure per ton rates are based on the total disposal capacity of the landfill. Residual risks: Changes in legislative or regulatory requirements, including changes in capping, closure activities or post closure monitoring activities, types and quantities of materials used, or term of post closure care, could cause changes in our cost estimates. Changes in the landfill retirement obligation due to changes in the anticipated waste flow, changes in airspace compaction estimates or changes in the timing of expenditures for closed landfills and fully incurred but unpaid capping events are recorded in results of operations prospectively. This could result in unanticipated increases or decreases in expense. Actual timing of disposal capacity utilization could differ from projected timing, causing differences in timing of when amortization and accretion expense is recognized for capping, closure and post closure liabilities. Changes in inflation rates could impact our actual future costs and our total liabilities. Changes in our capital structure or market conditions could result in changes to the credit adjusted risk free rate used to discount the liabilities, which could cause changes in future recorded liabilities, assets and expense. Amortization rates could change in the future based on the evaluation of new facts and circumstances relating to landfill capping design, post closure monitoring requirements, or the inflation or discount rate. On an annual basis, we update our estimates of future capping, closure and post closure costs and of future disposal capacity for each landfill. Revisions in estimates of our costs or timing of expenditures are recognized immediately as increases or decreases to the capping, closure and post closure liabilities and the corresponding retirement obligation assets. Changes in the assets result in changes to the amortization rates which are applied prospectively, except for fully incurred capping events and closed landfills, where the changes are recorded immediately in results of operations since the associated disposal capacity has already been consumed. Permitted and probable disposal capacity. Disposal capacity is determined by the specifications detailed in the landfill permit. We classify this disposal capacity as permitted. We also include probable expansion disposal capacity in our remaining disposal capacity estimates, thus including additional disposal capacity being sought through means of a permit expansion. Probable expansion disposal capacity has not yet received final approval from the applicable regulatory agencies, but we have determined that certain critical criteria have been met and the successful completion of the expansion is probable. We have developed six criteria that must be met before an expansion area is designated as probable expansion airspace. We believe that satisfying all of these criteria demonstrates a high likelihood that expansion airspace that is incorporated in our landfill costing will be permitted. However, because some of these criteria are judgmental, they may exclude expansion airspace that will eventually be permitted or include expansion airspace that will not be permitted. In either of these scenarios, our amortization, depletion and accretion expense could change significantly. Our internal criteria to classify disposal capacity as probable expansion airspace are as follows: We own the land associated with the expansion airspace or control it pursuant to an option agreement; We are committed to supporting the expansion project financially and with appropriate resources; 65 Table of Contents There are no identified fatal flaws or impediments associated with the project, including political impediments; Progress is being made on the project; The expansion is attainable within a reasonable time frame; and We believe it is likely we will receive the expansion permit. After successfully meeting these criteria, the disposal capacity that will result from the planned expansion is included in our remaining disposal capacity estimates. Additionally, for purposes of calculating landfill amortization and capping, closure and post closure rates, we include the incremental costs to develop, construct, close and monitor the related probable expansion disposal capacity. Residual risk: We may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity because of the failure to obtain the final local, state or federal permits or due to other unknown reasons. If we are unsuccessful in obtaining permits for probable expansion disposal capacity, or the disposal capacity for which we obtain approvals is less than what was estimated, both our estimated total costs and disposal capacity will be reduced, which generally increases the rates we charge for landfill amortization and capping, closure and post closure accruals. An unexpected decrease in disposal capacity could also cause an asset impairment. Environmental Liabilities We are subject to an array of laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment, and we remediate sites in the ordinary course of our business. Under current laws and regulations, we may be responsible for environmental remediation at sites that we either own or operate, including sites that we have acquired, or sites where we have (or a company that we have acquired has) delivered waste. Our environmental remediation liabilities primarily include costs associated with remediating groundwater, surface water and soil contamination, as well as controlling and containing methane gas migration and the related legal costs. To estimate our ultimate liability at these sites, we evaluate several factors, including the nature and extent of contamination at each identified site, the required remediation methods, the apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties and the financial viability of those parties. We accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable in accordance with accounting for loss contingencies. We periodically review the status of all environmental matters and update our estimates of the likelihood of and future expenditures for remediation as necessary. Changes in the liabilities resulting from these reviews are recognized currently in earnings in the period in which the adjustment is known. Adjustments to estimates are reasonably possible in the near term and may result in changes to recorded amounts. With the exception of those obligations assumed in the acquisition of Allied that were recorded at estimated fair value, environmental obligations are recorded on an undiscounted basis. We have not reduced the liabilities we have recorded for recoveries from other potentially responsible parties or insurance companies. Residual risks: We cannot determine with precision the ultimate amounts of our environmental remediation liabilities. Our estimates of these liabilities require assumptions about future events that are uncertain. Consequently, our estimates could change substantially as additional information becomes available regarding the nature or extent of contamination, the required remediation methods, the final apportionment of responsibility among the potentially responsible parties identified, the financial viability of those parties, and the actions of governmental agencies or private parties with interests in the matter. 66 Table of Contents Actual amounts could differ from the estimated liabilities as a result of changes in estimated future litigation costs to pursue the matter to ultimate resolution. An unanticipated environmental liability that arises could result in a material charge to our consolidated statement of income. Self Insurance Reserves and Related Costs Our insurance programs for workers compensation, general liability, vehicle liability and employee related health care benefits are effectively self insured. Accruals for self insurance reserves are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported. We maintain high deductibles for commercial general liability, automobile liability and workers compensation coverage, ranging from $2.0 million to $5.0 million. Residual risks: Incident rates, including frequency and severity, and other actuarial assumptions could change causing our current and future actuarially determined obligations to change, which would be reflected in our consolidated statement of income in the period in which such adjustment is known. Recorded reserves may not be adequate to cover the future payment of claims. Adjustments, if any, to estimates recorded resulting from ultimate claim payments would be reflected in the consolidated statements of income in the periods in which such adjustments are known. The settlement costs to discharge our obligations, including legal and health care costs, could increase or decrease causing current estimates of our self insurance reserves to change. Loss Contingencies We are subject to various legal proceedings, claims and regulatory matters, the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty. We determine whether to disclose or accrue for loss contingencies based on an assessment of whether the risk of loss is remote, reasonably possible or probable, and whether it can be reasonably estimated. We analyze our litigation and regulatory matters based on available information to assess the potential liabilities. Managements assessment is developed based on an analysis of possible outcomes under various strategies. We record and disclose loss contingencies pursuant to the applicable accounting guidance for such matter. We record losses related to contingencies in cost of operations or selling, general and administrative expenses, depending on the nature of the underlying transaction leading to the loss contingency. Residual risks: Actual costs may vary from our estimates for a variety of reasons, including differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments of the amount of damages. Loss contingency assumptions involve judgments that are inherently subjective and generally involve matters that are by their nature unpredictable. If a loss contingency results in an adverse judgment or is settled for a significant amount, it could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial position, result of operations or cash flows in the period in which such judgment or settlement occurs. Asset Impairment Valuation methodology. We evaluate our long lived assets (other than goodwill) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset or asset group may not be recoverable based on projected cash flows anticipated to be generated from the ongoing operation of those assets or we intend to sell or otherwise dispose of the assets. 67 Table of Contents Residual risk: If events or changes in circumstances occur, including reductions in anticipated cash flows generated by our operations or determinations to divest assets, certain assets could be impaired, which would result in a non cash charge to earnings. Evaluation criteria. We test long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of the assets may not be recoverable. Examples of such events could include a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which we use a long lived asset, a change in its physical condition, or new circumstances that could cause an expectation that it is more likely than not that we would sell or otherwise dispose of a long lived asset significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life. Residual risk: Our most significant asset impairment exposure, other than goodwill (which is discussed below) relates to our landfills. A significant reduction in our estimated disposal capacity as a result of unanticipated events such as regulatory developments, revocation of an existing permit or denial of an expansion permit, or changes in our assumptions used to calculate disposal capacity, could trigger an impairment charge. Recognition criteria. If such circumstances arise, we recognize impairment for the difference between the carrying amount and fair value of the asset if the net book value of the asset exceeds the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. We generally use the present value of the expected cash flows from that asset to determine fair value. Goodwill Recoverability We annually test goodwill for impairment at December 31 or when an indicator of impairment exists. We test goodwill for impairment using the two step process. The first step is a screen for potential impairment, while the second step measures the amount of the impairment, if any. The first step of the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill. We have defined our reporting units to be consistent with our operating segments: Eastern, Midwestern, Southern, and Western. In determining fair value, we primarily use discounted future cash flows and operating results based on a comparative multiple of earnings or revenues. Significant estimates used in our fair value calculation using discounted future cash flows include: (i) estimates of future revenue and expense growth by reporting unit, which we estimate to range from 2% to 4%; (ii) future estimated effective tax rates, which we estimate to be 40%; (iii) future estimated capital expenditures as well as future required investments in working capital; (iv) estimated discount rates, which we estimate to range between 7% and 8%; and (v) the future terminal value of the reporting unit, which is based on its ability to exist into perpetuity. Significant estimates used in the fair value calculation using market value multiples include: (i) estimated future growth potential of the reporting unit; (ii) estimated multiples of revenue or earnings a willing buyer is likely to pay; and (iii) estimated control premium a willing buyer is likely to pay. In addition, we evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests, indicating a possible impairment. Examples of such events or circumstances include: (i) a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; (ii) an adverse action or assessment by a regulator; (iii) a more likely than not expectation that a reporting unit or a significant portion thereof will be sold; (iv) continued or sustained losses at a reporting unit; (v) a significant decline in our market capitalization as compared to our book value; or (vi) the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit. We assign assets and liabilities from our corporate operating segment to our four reporting units to the extent that such assets or liabilities relate to the cash flows of the reporting unit and would be included in determining the reporting units fair value. 68 Table of Contents In preparing our annual test for impairment as of December 31, 2011, we determined that our indicated fair value of total invested capital exceeded our total market capitalization. We believe one of the primary reconciling differences between the indicated fair value of total invested capital and our total market capitalization is due to a control premium. We believe the control premium represents the value a market participant could extract as savings and or synergies by obtaining control, and thereby eliminating duplicative overhead and operating costs resulting from the consolidation of routes and internalization of waste streams. As of December 31, 2011, we determined that the indicated fair value of our reporting units exceeded their carrying value by a range of 30% to approximately 60% and, therefore, we noted no indicators of impairment at our reporting units. We will continuously monitor market trends in our business, the related expected cash flows and our calculation of market capitalization for purposes of identifying possible indicators of impairment. If our book value per share exceeds our market price per share or if we have other indicators of impairment, we will be required to perform an interim step one impairment analysis, which may lead to a step two analysis and possible impairment of our goodwill. Additionally, we would then be required to review our remaining long lived assets for impairment. Our operating segments, which also represent our reporting units, are comprised of several vertically integrated businesses. When an individual business within an integrated operating segment is divested, goodwill is allocated to that business based on its fair value relative to the fair value of its operating segment. Residual risks: Future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with acquired businesses is impaired. The valuation of identifiable goodwill requires significant estimates and judgment about future performance, cash flows and fair value. Our future results could be affected if these current estimates of future performance and fair value change. For example, a reduction in long term growth assumptions could reduce the estimated fair value of the operating segments to below their carrying values, which could trigger an impairment charge. Similarly, an increase in our discount rate could trigger an impairment charge. Any resulting impairment charge could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Income Taxes Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and income tax bases of assets (other than non deductible goodwill) and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the income tax rate in effect during the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We record net deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets will more likely than not be realized. In making this determination, we consider all available positive and negative evidence, including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income, tax planning strategies and recent financial operations. In the event we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount, we will make an adjustment to the valuation allowance which would reduce our provision for income taxes. Our income tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect managements best assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid. We are subject to U.S. federal income taxes and numerous state jurisdictions. Significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the combined income tax expense. Regarding the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements, we record a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon 69 Table of Contents examination, including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. We recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions within the provision for income taxes in our consolidated statements of income. Accrued interest and penalties are included within other accrued liabilities and deferred income taxes and other long term tax liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. Residual risks: Income tax assets and liabilities established in purchase accounting for acquisitions are based on assumptions that could differ from the ultimate outcome of the tax matters. Such adjustments would be charged or credited to earnings, unless they meet certain remeasurement criteria and are allowed to be adjusted to goodwill. Changes in the estimated realizability of deferred tax assets could result in adjustments to our provision for income taxes. Valuation allowances for deferred tax assets and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes are based on our judgment. If our judgments and estimates concerning valuation allowances and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards are incorrect, our provision for income taxes would change. We are currently under examination or administrative review by various state and federal taxing authorities for certain tax years. The Internal Revenue Code and income tax regulations are a complex set of rules that we must interpret and apply. Positions taken in tax years under examination or subsequent years are subject to challenge. Accordingly, we may have exposure for additional tax liabilities arising from these audits if any positions taken by us or by companies we have acquired are disallowed by the taxing authorities. We adjust our liabilities for uncertain tax positions when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available. Due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, their ultimate resolution may result in payments that are materially different from our current estimates of the tax liabilities. These differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to our provision for income taxes in the period in which they are determined. Defined Benefit Pension Plans We currently have one qualified defined benefit pension plan, the BFI Retirement Plan (the Plan). The Plan covers certain employees in the United States, including some employees subject to collective bargaining agreements. The Plans benefit formula is based on a percentage of compensation as defined in the Plan document. The benefits of approximately 97% of the current plan participants were frozen upon Allieds acquisition of BFI in 1999. Our pension contributions are made in accordance with funding standards established by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code, as amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. The Plans assets are invested as determined by our Retirement Benefits Committee. At December 31, 2011, the plan assets were invested in fixed income bond funds, equity funds and cash. We annually review and adjust the plans asset allocation as deemed necessary. Our unfunded benefit obligation for the Plan was $39.9 million as of December 31, 2011 compared to $7.7 million as of December 31, 2010. Residual risk: Changes in the plans investment mix and performance of the equity and bond markets and fund managers could impact the amount of pension income or expense recorded, the funded status of the plan and the need for future cash contributions. 70 Table of Contents Assumptions. The benefit obligation and associated income or expense related to the Plan are determined based on assumptions concerning items such as discount rates, expected rates of return and average rates of compensation increases. Our assumptions are reviewed annually and adjusted as deemed necessary. We determine the discount rate based on a model which matches the timing and amount of expected benefit payments to maturities of high quality bonds priced as of the Plan measurement date. Where that timing does not correspond to a published high quality bond rate, our model uses an expected yield curve to determine an appropriate current discount rate. The yield on the bonds is used to derive a discount rate for the liability. If the discount rate were to increase by 1%, our benefit obligation would decrease by approximately $31 million. If the discount rate were to decrease by 1%, our benefit obligation would increase by approximately $37 million. In developing our expected rate of return assumption, we evaluate long term expected and historical returns on the Plan assets, giving consideration to our asset mix and the anticipated duration of the Plan obligations. The average rate of compensation increase reflects our expectations of average pay increases over the periods benefits are earned. Less than 3% of participants in the Plan continue to earn service benefits. Residual risks: Our assumed discount rate is sensitive to changes in market based interest rates. A decrease in the discount rate will increase our related benefit plan obligation. Our annual pension expense would be impacted if the actual return on plan assets were to vary from the expected return. New Accounting Standards For a description of new accounting standards that may affect us, see Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, to our consolidated financial statements in Item 8 of this Form 10 K. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Interest Rate Risk Our major market risk exposure of our financial instruments is changing interest rates in the United States and fluctuations in LIBOR. We intend to manage interest rate risk through the use of a combination of fixed and floating rate debt. The carrying value of our variable rate debt approximates fair value because interest rates are variable and, accordingly, approximates current market rates for instruments with similar risk and maturities. The fair value of our debt is determined as of the balance sheet date and is subject to change. The table below provides information about certain of our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement. Expected Maturity Date 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Thereafter Total Fair Valueof (Asset) /Liability as ofDecember 31,2011 Fixed Rate Debt: Amount outstanding (in millions) $ 30.7 $ 5.5 $ 16.0 $ 25.7 $ 4.5 $ 6,108.9 $ 6,191.3 $ 6,191.3 Average interest rates 5.2 % 7.0 % 6.0 % 5.7 % 7.5 % 5.5 % 5.5 % Variable Rate Debt: Amount outstanding (in millions) $ $ 27.2 $ $ $ 17.2 $ 856.5 $ 900.9 $ 900.9 Average interest rates % 2.1 % % % 3.3 % 0.8 % 0.9 % 71 Table of Contents The fixed and variable rate debt amounts above exclude the remaining non cash discounts, premiums and adjustments to fair value recorded in purchase accounting totaling $170.4 million. Fuel Price Risk Fuel costs represent a significant operating expense. When economically practical, we may enter into new or renew contracts, or engage in other strategies to mitigate market risk. Where appropriate, we have implemented a fuel recovery fee that is designed to recover our fuel costs. While we charge these fees to a majority of our customers, we are unable to charge such fees to all customers. Consequently, an increase in fuel costs results in (1) an increase in our cost of operations, (2) a smaller increase in our revenue (from the fuel recovery fee) and (3) a decrease in our operating margin percentage, because the increase in revenue is more than offset by the increase in cost. Conversely, a decrease in fuel costs results in (1) a decrease in our cost of operations, (2) a smaller decrease in our revenue and (3) an increase in our operating margin percentage. At our current consumption levels, a one cent per gallon change in the price of diesel fuel changes our fuel costs by approximately $1.4 million on an annual basis, which would be partially offset by a smaller change in the fuel recovery fees charged to our customers. Accordingly, a substantial rise or drop in fuel costs could result in a material impact to our revenue and cost of operations. Our operations also require the use of certain petrochemical based products (such as liners at our landfills) whose costs may vary with the price of petrochemicals. An increase in the price of petrochemicals could increase the cost of those products, which would increase our operating and capital costs. We also are susceptible to increases in indirect fuel recovery fees from our vendors. Commodities Prices We market recycled products such as cardboard and newspaper from our materials recovery facilities. Market demand for recyclable materials causes volatility in commodity prices. At current volumes and mix of materials, we believe a ten dollar per ton change in the price of recyclable materials will change revenue and operating income by approximately $27 million and $18 million, respectively, on an annual basis. Revenue from sales of these products in 2011, 2010 and 2009 was approximately $438.6 million, $337.9 million and $229.8 million, respectively. 72 Table of Contents
