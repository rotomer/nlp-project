Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Overview Raytheon Company (the Company) is one of the largest defense electronics contractors in the world, serving all branches of the U.S. military and other U.S. government agencies, NATO, and many allied governments. The Company is a leader in defense electronics, including missiles; radar; sensors and electro optics; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); command, control, communication, and information systems; naval systems; air traffic control systems; and technical services. The Companys defense electronics businesses are well positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities in missile defense; precision engagement; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; and homeland security. Due to the multi year defense spending cycle, recent increased budget authorizations in these areas are expected to favorably impact the Companys defense electronics businesses over the next several years. Raytheons commercial electronics businesses leverage defense technologies in commercial markets. Raytheon Aircraft is a leading provider of business and special mission aircraft and delivers a broad line of jet, turboprop, and piston powered airplanes to corporate and government customers worldwide. The Company continues to see soft demand for new and used aircraft in 2003. Defense Industry Considerations Few recent developments have altered the defense and security environment of the United States as dramatically as the events of September 11, 2001. In response, the U.S. has committed itself to a long term war on terrorism. Simultaneously, the U.S. must also replenish war materials consumed during operations in Afghanistan while also making progress toward Secretary Rumsfelds goal of military transformation. The latest U.S. Department of Defense budget reflects these three diverse objectives. Military transformation, which had been under review prior to September 11th, is expected to gain momentum. Secretary Rumsfeld is focused on 4 pillars of transformation: Strengthening joint operations Experimenting with new approaches to warfare Exploiting U.S. intelligence advantages Developing transformational capabilities Transformation is focused on meeting the military challenges of the future. In this new environment, the need for advanced technology and defense electronics is clear. In order to respond quickly to global threats and protect our forces in theater, the U.S. will have to rely more heavily on intelligence and instantaneous, secure communication. At the same time, our military must also help defend the homeland against terrorist and missile attack. The Companys strategy is focused on meeting domestic and international customers needs in areas where the Company has both experience and technology discriminators. The Companys growth strategy is focused on four strategic business areas: Missile Defense Precision Engagement Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Homeland Security The President has made a commitment to have a U.S. missile defense system operational by 2004. The Company has a broad array of technology and capabilities in this growing area. From the Companys hit to kill weapons, to radar sensors, to space based infrared sensors, to command and control, the Company is positioned to meet the nations needs. While the Companys position as a leader in Missile Defense is well recognized, Precision Engagement is a much broader concept. It includes the identification and tracking of targets as well as engagement and effectiveness assessment. The Company produces products across the entire engagement chain. The Companys innovative sensing, processing, and dissemination technologies effectively compress the information gap from hours to minutes. The Companys Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance programs cover the full spectrum of information management, providing the ability to task, collect, process, exploit, and disseminate national and tactical target data. These abilities are crucial for warfighters to achieve information dominance throughout the entire battlespace. In the area of Homeland Security, the Company has skills, experience, and technology in areas such as airport security; command, control, and communications; and the integration and fusion of sensory inputs for real time decision support. This is still a new market with significant uncertainty and the ultimate customers and available funding have yet to be determined. Unlike many major defense contractors, the Company provides electronics for a wide range of missions and platforms. The Company has several thousand programs. This reduces some of the risk and volatility often inherent in the defense industry. The Company generally acts as a prime contractor or subcontractor on its programs. The funding of U.S. government programs is subject to Congressional authorization and appropriation. While Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis, major defense programs are usually conducted under binding contracts over multiple years, which provides a level of continuity uncommon to many industries. The termination of funding for a U.S. government program could result in a loss of future revenues, which would have a negative effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations. U.S. government contracts are generally subject to oversight audits and contain provisions for termination. Failure to comply with U.S. government regulations could lead to suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting. Sales to the U.S. government may be affected by changes in procurement policies, budget considerations, changing defense requirements, and political developments. The influence of these factors, which are largely beyond the Companys control, could impact the Companys operations. Consolidated Results of Operations Net sales were $16.8 billion in 2002, $16.0 billion in 2001, and $15.8 billion in 2000. Sales to the U.S. Department of Defense were 62 percent of sales in 2002 and 59 percent in 2001 and 2000. Total sales to the U.S. government, including foreign military sales, were 73 percent of sales in 2002, 70 percent in 2001, and 65 percent in 2000. International sales, including foreign military sales, were 21 percent of sales in 2002, 22 percent in 2001, and 20 percent in 2000. Gross margin, net sales less cost of sales, was $3.4 billion in 2002, $2.4 billion in 2001, and $3.2 billion in 2000, or 20.3 percent of sales in 2002, 14.7 percent in 2001, and 20.3 percent in 2000. Included in gross margin in 2001 were charges of $745 million at Raytheon Aircraft, described below in Segment Results, and goodwill amortization of $334 million which was discontinued January 1, 2002 in accordance with SFAS No. 142, described below. Included in gross margin in 2000 was a $74 million favorable adjustment to restructuring related reserves that was more than offset by unfavorable contract adjustments. Also included in gross margin in 2000 was goodwill amortization of $337 million. Excluding the Raytheon Aircraft charges and goodwill amortization, gross margin was $3.4 billion or 21.4 percent of sales in 2001. Excluding goodwill amortization, gross margin was $3.5 billion or 22.4 percent of sales in 2000. The decrease in gross margin as a percent of sales in 2002 was due to lower pension income. The decrease in gross margin as a percent of sales in 2001 was due to lower margins at Raytheon Aircraft. Included in gross margin was pension income of $89 million, $297 million, and $143 million in 2002, 2001, and 2000, respectively. Beginning in the first quarter of 2003, the Company will change the way pension expense or income is reported in the Companys segment results, described below in Segment Reorganization. Administrative and selling expenses were $1,199 million or 7.2 percent of sales in 2002, $1,131 million or 7.1 percent of sales in 2001, and $1,117 million or 7.1 percent of sales in 2000. Research and development expenses were $449 million or 2.7 percent of sales in 2002, $456 million or 2.8 percent of sales in 2001, and $507 million or 3.2 percent of sales in 2000. The decrease in research and development expenses in 2002 and 2001 was due to more focused research and development efforts and new program investments made in 2000. Operating income was $1,754 million or 10.5 percent of sales in 2002, $766 million or 4.8 percent of sales in 2001, and $1,580 million or 10.0 percent of sales in 2000. Excluding the Raytheon Aircraft charges and goodwill amortization, operating income was $1,845 million or 11.5 percent of sales in 2001. Excluding goodwill amortization, 24 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations continued operating income was $1,917 million or 12.1 percent of sales in 2000. The changes in operating income by segment are described below in Segment Results. Interest expense from continuing operations was $497 million in 2002, $696 million in 2001, and $761 million in 2000. In 2002 and 2001, the Company allocated $79 million and $18 million, respectively, of interest expense to discontinued operations. The Company will not allocate interest expense to discontinued operations in 2003. Total interest expense was $576 million in 2002 and $714 million in 2001. The decrease in 2002 and 2001 was due to lower average debt and lower weighted average cost of borrowing due, in part, to the interest rate swaps entered into in 2001, described below in Capital Structure and Resources. The weighted average cost of borrowing was 6.7 percent in 2002, 7.1 percent in 2001, and 7.3 percent in 2000. Interest income was $27 million in 2002, $36 million in 2001, and $25 million in 2000. Other expense, net was $210 million in 2002 versus other income, net of $18 million in 2001 and other expense, net of $12 million in 2000. Included in other expense, net in 2002 was a $175 million charge to write off the Companys investment in Space Imaging&reg; and accrue for a related credit facility guarantee on which the Company expects to make payment in 2003, described below in Major Affiliated Entities, and a $29 million gain on the sale of the Companys corporate headquarters. Other income and expense also included gains and losses on divestitures and equity losses in unconsolidated subsidiaries, as described in Note S, Other Income and Expense of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The effective tax rate was 29.7 percent in 2002, reflecting the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent reduced by foreign sales corporation tax credits, ESOP dividend deductions, and research and development tax credits applicable to certain government contracts. The effective tax rate was 85.5 percent in 2001, reflecting the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent reduced by foreign sales corporation tax credits, ESOP dividend deductions, and research and development tax credits applicable to certain government contracts, and increased by non deductible amortization of goodwill. The effective tax rate was 42.7 percent in 2000, reflecting the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent reduced by foreign sales corporation tax credits and research and development tax credits applicable to certain government contracts, and increased by non deductible amortization of goodwill. Excluding the effect of the Raytheon Aircraft charges and goodwill amortization, the effective tax rate was 32.9 percent in 2001. Excluding the effect of goodwill amortization, the effective tax rate was 32.7 percent in 2000. At December 31, 2002, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $1.2 billion that expire in 2020 through 2022 and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $87 million that expire in 2005 through 2007. The Company believes it will be able to utilize all of these carryforwards over the next 3 to 4 years. Income from continuing operations was $755 million or $1.85 per diluted share on 408.0 million average shares outstanding in 2002, $18 million or $0.05 per diluted share on 361.3 million average shares outstanding in 2001, and $477 million or $1.40 per diluted share on 341.1 million average shares outstanding in 2000. Excluding the Raytheon Aircraft charges and goodwill amortization, income from continuing operations was $807 million or $2.23 per diluted share in 2001. Excluding goodwill amortization, income from continuing operations was $787 million or $2.31 per diluted share in 2000. The increase in average shares outstanding was due primarily to the issuance of 14,375,000 and 31,578,900 shares of common stock in May and October 2001, respectively. The loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, described below in Discontinued Operations, was $887 million or $2.17 per diluted share in 2002, $757 million or $2.10 per diluted share in 2001, and $339 million or $0.99 per diluted share in 2000. There was an extraordinary gain from debt repurchases of $1 million after tax in 2002 and an extraordinary loss from debt repurchases of $16 million after tax or $0.04 per diluted share in 2001. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142). This accounting standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets and requires that goodwill amortization be discontinued and replaced with periodic tests of impairment. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill amortization was discontinued as of January 1, 2002. In 2002, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $360 million related to its former Aircraft Integration Systems business (AIS) as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. Due to the non deductibility of this goodwill, the Company did not record a tax benefit in connection with this impairment. Also in 2002, the Company completed its transitional review for potential goodwill impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142, whereby the Company utilized a market multiple approach to determine the fair value of the 13 reporting units within the defense businesses and allocated goodwill to the defense businesses based upon an estimate of the fair value of the portion of a previously acquired company contribution to the new segment. The Company utilized a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of the commercial business reporting units. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $185 million pretax or $149 million after tax, which represented all of the goodwill at Raytheon Aircraft, as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. The Company also determined that there was no impairment of goodwill related to any of its defense businesses beyond the $360 million related to AIS. The total goodwill impairment charge in 2002 was $545 million pretax, $509 million after tax, or $1.25 per diluted share. The net loss was $640 million or $1.57 per diluted share in 2002 versus $755 million or $2.09 per diluted share in 2001 and net income of $138 million or $0.40 per diluted share in 2000. Excluding the Raytheon Aircraft charges and goodwill amortization, net income was $62 million or $0.17 per diluted share in 2001. Excluding goodwill amortization, net income was $481 million or $1.41 per diluted share in 2000. Prior Period Restructuring Initiatives The Company essentially completed all prior period restructuring initiatives in 2000 except for ongoing idle facility costs. At December 31, 2002, the accrued liability related to prior period restructuring initiatives was $4 million. In 2002, the Company determined that the cost of certain prior period restructuring initiatives would be lower than originally planned and recorded a $4 million favorable adjustment to cost of sales, a $3 million favorable adjustment to general and administrative expenses, and a $1 million reduction in goodwill. In 2001, the Company determined that the cost of certain prior period restructuring initiatives would be lower than originally planned and recorded an $8 million favorable adjustment to cost of sales. In 2000, the Company determined that the cost of certain prior period restructuring initiatives would be lower than originally planned and recorded a $74 million favorable adjustment to cost of sales and an $11 million reduction in goodwill.

The increase in sales in 2002 was due to higher U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) expenditures. The increase in sales in 2001 was due to higher volume across most business units. Operating income was $1,260 million in 2002 versus $1,111 million in 2001 and $1,044 million in 2000. Excluding goodwill amortization, operating income was $1,302 million in 2001 and $1,237 million in 2000. The decrease in operating income in 2002 was due to lower pension income, offset by higher volume. The increase in operating income in 2001 was due to higher volume and higher pension income. C3I had 2002 sales of $4.1 billion versus $3.8 billion in 2001 and $3.4 billion in 2000. The increase in sales in 2002 was due to higher U.S. DoD expenditures. The increase in sales in 2001 was due to higher volume in U.S. Navy, domestic air traffic control, classified, and secure network programs. Operating income was $420 million in 2002 versus $396 million in 2001 and $358 million in 2000. Included in operating income in 2002 was a charge related to a dispute on a previously terminated commercial contract and a charge related to a current contract dispute that could affect the collection of amounts due. These charges totaled $20 million. Also included was a charge of $19 million to write down receivables related to programs that ended in prior years. Excluding goodwill amortization, operating income was $496 million in 2001 and $458 million in 2000. The decrease in operating income in 2002 was due to the charges described above, cost growth on certain programs, and lower pension income, offset by higher volume. The increase in operating income in 2001 was due to higher volume and higher pension income. TS had 2002 and 2001 sales of $2.1 billion versus $1.8 billion in 2000. The sales volume at TS remained flat in 2002 despite higher U.S. DoD expenditures due to the loss of several key programs. The increase in sales in 2001 was due to higher volume from new programs. Operating income was $128 million in 2002 versus $158 million in 2001 and $123 million in 2000. Excluding goodwill amortization, operating income was $186 million in 2001 and $152 million in 2000. The decrease in operating income in 2002 was due to a $28 million write off of contract costs that the Company determined were unbillable. The decrease was offset by a similarly sized reserve at corporate established by the Company in the second half of 2001 to address the issue. The increase in operating income in 2001 was due to higher volume and higher pension income. Commercial Electronics (CE) had 2002 sales of $423 million versus $453 million in 2001 and $666 million in 2000. The decrease in sales in 2002 and 2001 was due to the divestiture of the Companys recreational marine business in January 2001 and lower 26 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations continued volume at RF Components due to reduced industry wide demand and pricing pressures for cellular handset components. The operating loss was $4 million in 2002 versus $57 million in 2001 and $4 million in 2000. The decrease in the operating loss in 2002 was due to the closure of certain unprofitable businesses and cost reduction actions taken. The increase in the operating loss in 2001 was due to the decline in volume. Contributing to the loss in 2000 was an $8 million restructuring charge at Raytheon Marines High Seas division and investments in new technology ventures, offset by a $21 million favorable settlement on a commercial training contract. Excluding goodwill amortization, CE had an operating loss of $50 million in 2001 and operating income of $4 million in 2000. RAC had 2002 sales of $2.2 billion versus $2.6 billion in 2001 and $3.2 billion in 2000. The decrease in sales was due to lower aircraft deliveries, the divestiture of a majority interest in the Companys fractional ownership business in March 2002, and the divestiture of a majority interest in the Companys aviation support business in June 2001. The operating loss was $4 million in 2002 versus $760 million in 2001 and operating income of $159 million in 2000. Included in the 2001 results was a charge of $693 million related to the Companys commuter aircraft business. This was a result of continued weakness in the commuter aircraft market and the impact of the events of September 11, 2001 on the commuter airline industry. During the first half of 2001, the Company experienced a significant decrease in the volume of used commuter aircraft sales. An evaluation of commuter aircraft market conditions and the events of September 11, 2001 indicated that the market weakness would continue into the foreseeable future. As a result, the Company completed an analysis of the estimated fair value of the various models of commuter aircraft and reduced the book value of commuter aircraft inventory and equipment leased to others accordingly. In addition, the Company adjusted the book value of long term receivables and established a reserve for off balance sheet receivables based on the Companys estimate of exposures on customer financed assets due to defaults, refinancing, and remarketing of these aircraft. In 2002, the Company bought back the remaining off balance sheet receivables, described below in Off Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements. The Company also recorded a $52 million charge related to a fleet of Starship&reg; aircraft in 2001. During the first three quarters of 2001, the Company had not sold any of these aircraft and recorded a charge to reduce the value of the aircraft to their estimated fair value. In connection with the buyback of the off balance sheet receivables, the Company recorded the long term receivables at estimated fair value, which included an assessment of the value of the underlying aircraft. As a result of this assessment, the Company adjusted the value of certain underlying aircraft, including both commuter and Starship aircraft, some of which were written down to scrap value. There was no net income statement impact as a result of this activity. Excluding the 2001 charges and goodwill amortization, the operating loss was $7 million in 2001. Excluding goodwill amortization, operating income was $166 million in 2000. The decrease in the operating loss in 2002 was due to cost reductions and an $18 million favorable contract adjustment recorded in 2002, partially offset by lower pension income and lower volume. The decrease in operating income in 2001 was due to adverse sales mix and margin pressure on T 6A, Beechjet, and used aircraft due to the market environment. The Company remains concerned about the market outlook for both new and used aircraft. Backlog at December 31 (In millions) 2002 2001 2000 Electronic Systems $ 13,632 $ 13,423 $ 13,260 Command, Control, Communication and Information Systems 5,633 5,592 5,396 Technical Services 1,603 1,958 2,142 Commercial Electronics 402 467 513 Aircraft 4,396 4,165 4,398 Total $ 25,666 $ 25,605 $ 25,709 U.S. government backlog included above $ 18,254 $ 16,943 $ 16,650 Included in Aircraft backlog is approximately $900 million related to an order for the Hawker Horizon which, due to current market conditions and development and certification delays, could be restructured or cancelled. Also included in Aircraft backlog is approximately $850 million related to an order received from Flight Options&reg;. If the Company consolidates Flight Options, as described below in Major Affiliated Entities, the Company would reduce its reported Aircraft backlog by approximately $850 million. In addition, in connection with the sale of a majority interest in the Companys aviation support business in June 2001, Aircraft backlog was reduced by $228 million. Approximately $275 million of backlog was reclassified from Electronic Systems to Command, Control, Communication and Information Systems in 2001 in connection with the formation of TRS, described above. Bookings (In millions) 2002 2001 2000 Electronic Systems $ 8,986 $ 8,778 $ 8,912 Command, Control, Communication and Information Systems 4,335 3,744 4,036 Technical Services 1,339 1,250 1,586 Commercial Electronics 240 331 615 Aircraft 2,409 2,567 3,336 Total $ 17,309 $ 16,670 $ 18,485 Significant bookings in 2002 included the U.S. Navys contract award for the DD(X) program of $1.1 billion at ES and the National Polar orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System of $900 million at C3I. The decrease in bookings in 2001 was due to the impact of divestitures as well as several large bookings with extended periods of performance at C3I and TS in 1999. In addition, the Companys commercial businesses have been affected by softening market conditions, resulting in declining orders. Segment Reorganization Effective January 1, 2003, the Company will begin reporting its government and defense businesses in six segments. In addition, the Companys Commercial Electronics businesses have been reassigned to the new government and defense businesses. The Companys Aircraft segment will continue to be reported separately. Accordingly, beginning in the first quarter of 2003, the Company will report its financial results in the following segments: IDS, IIS, MS, NCS, SAS, TS, and RAC. Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) provides integrated air and missile defense and naval and maritime war fighting systems and modeling and simulation capabilities.

Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) manufactures, markets, and supports business jets, turboprops, and piston powered aircraft for the worlds commercial, regional airline, fractional ownership, and military aircraft markets. Also beginning in the first quarter of 2003, the Company will change the way pension expense or income is reported in the Companys segment results. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, outlines the methodology used to determine pension expense or income for financial reporting purposes, which is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements of pension plans, 27 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations continued which are determined by other factors. A major factor for determining pension funding requirements are Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) that proscribe the allocation to and recovery of pension costs on U.S. government contracts. The Company will report the difference between SFAS No. 87 (FAS) pension expense or income and CAS pension expense as a separate line item in the Companys segment results called FAS/CAS Income Adjustment. The Companys individual segment results will now only include pension expense as determined under CAS, which can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. Previously, the Companys individual segment results included FAS pension expense or income, which consisted of CAS pension expense and an adjustment to reconcile CAS pension expense to FAS pension expense or income. The following information reflects the Companys segment results during 2002 and 2001 in the realigned structure. In addition, the individual segment results below include pension expense determined under CAS.

Discontinued Operations In 2002, the Company sold its Aircraft Integration Systems business (AIS) for $1,123 million, net, subject to purchase price adjustments. The Company is currently involved in a purchase price dispute related to the sale of AIS. There was no pretax gain or loss on the sale of AIS, however, due to the non deductible goodwill associated with AIS, the Company recorded a tax provision of $212 million, resulting in a $212 million after tax loss on the sale of AIS. As part of the transaction, the Company retained the responsibility for performance of the Boeing Business Jet&reg; (BBJ) program. The Company also retained $106 million of BBJ related assets, $18 million of receivables and other assets, and rights to a $25 million jury award related to a 1999 claim against Learjet&reg;. At December 31, 2002, the balance of these retained assets was $64 million. Schedule delays, cost growth, and other variables could continue to have a negative effect on these retained assets. The timing and amount of net realizable value of these retained assets are uncertain and subject to a number of unpredictable market forces. In 2002, the Company recorded charges related to AIS of $66 million, which included a $23 million write down of a BBJ related aircraft owned by the Company, a $28 million charge for cost growth on one of the two BBJ aircraft not yet delivered, and a $10 million 28 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations continued charge to write down other BBJ related assets to net realizable value, offset by a $13 million gain resulting from the finalization of the 1999 claim, described above. The write down of the BBJ related aircraft resulted from the Companys decision to market this aircraft unfinished due to the current environment of declining prices for BBJ related aircraft. The Company was previously marketing this aircraft as a customized executive BBJ. The write down of other BBJ related assets reflects the difficulty the Company has been experiencing in liquidating these assets. In 2002, the pretax loss from discontinued operations related to AIS was $47 million. In 2001 and 2000, pretax income from discontinued operations related to AIS was $5 million and $40 million, respectively. In 2000, the Company sold its Raytheon Engineers & Constructors businesses (RE&C) to Washington Group International, Inc. (WGI) for $73 million in cash plus assumption of debt and other obligations. At the time of the sale, the Company had, either directly or through a subsidiary that it still owns, outstanding letters of credit, performance bonds, and parent guarantees of performance and payment (the Support Agreements) on many long term construction contracts and certain leases. The Support Agreements were provided to customers at the time of contract award as security to the customers for the underlying contract obligations. Often, the total security was capped at the value of the contract price to secure full performance, including, in some cases, the payment of liquidated damages available under the contract. At December 31, 2002, the maximum exposure on outstanding Support Agreements for which there were stated values was $367 million for letters of credit, $344 million for performance bonds, and $25 million for parent guarantees. Of these amounts, $49 million of letters of credit and $258 million of performance bonds relate to projects assumed by WGI in its bankruptcy, as described below. There are additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no stated maximum value that also remain outstanding. Of the guarantees that have no maximum stated value, many relate to contract obligations that, by their terms, include caps on liability for certain types of obligations, and all of the underlying projects have substantially completed construction and are in the punchlist, warranty, commercial closeout, and claims resolution phase, except the two Massachusetts construction projects, described below. Some of these contingent obligations and guarantees include warranty provisions and extend for a number of years. In connection with the sale of RE&C, the Company was entitled to the financial rewards of certain claims, equity investments, and receivables totaling $159 million that were sold to WGI. In addition, the Company was obligated to indemnify WGI against certain obligations and liabilities totaling $88 million. As a result of WGIs bankruptcy filing, described below, the realization of these various assets through WGI was no longer probable, however, the obligations and liabilities could be set off against the assets pursuant to the terms of the purchase and sale agreement. In 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $71 million to write off these assets and liabilities. In March 2001, WGI abandoned two Massachusetts construction projects, triggering the Companys guarantees to the customer. The Company honored the guarantees and commenced work on these projects. Construction and start up activities continue on the two projects the Mystic Station plant and the Fore River plant. Pursuant to the construction contract, since the Mystic Station plant had not achieved performance test completion by January 14, 2003, the Company made payments totaling $68 million, which pre funded the delay and performance liquidated damages to the maximum amount specified by the construction contract. Also pursuant to the construction contract, the customer has taken the position that a similar missed deadline occurred on February 24, 2003 for the Fore River plant and that a payment of $67 million was required from the Company on that date to pre fund the delay and performance liquidated damages to the maximum amount specified by the construction contract. The Company believes that this February 24, 2003 deadline was incorrect and should have been extended as a result of changes for which the Company is entitled to change orders, an issue that is now being arbitrated between the Company and the customer. Accordingly, the Company did not make the requested payment to the customer on that date and has informed the customer that the deadline and requested payment are in dispute. As a result, the customer drew down on certain letters of credit totaling $27 million that had been posted by the Company as contract performance security. A resolution of the current dispute between the Company and the customer over the contract deadline and the applicable liquidated damages is dependent upon the outcome of the pending arbitration, which should be concluded later this year. In addition, risks remain in completing the two projects, including costs associated with the possibility of further delays, labor productivity, and the successful completion of required performance tests on the two projects. In 2002, the Company recorded a charge of $796 million resulting from an increase in the estimated cost to complete (ETC) for the two projects. The Company had previously recorded a charge of $814 million in 2001. The cost increases have resulted from declining productivity, schedule delays, misestimates of field engineered materials, and unbudgeted hours worked on the two projects. The Company expects to complete construction and performance testing on the two projects and turn them over to the customer during the second quarter of 2003. In May 2001, WGI filed for bankruptcy protection. In the course of the bankruptcy proceeding, WGI rejected some ongoing construction contracts and assumed others. In January 2002, WGI emerged from bankruptcy and as part of that process, the stock purchase agreement between WGI and the Company was terminated and WGI and the Company entered into a settlement agreement that provided, among other things, that WGI take reasonable actions to protect the Company against future exposure under Support Agreements related to contracts assumed by WGI and that WGI reimburse the Company for any associated costs incurred. For those contracts rejected by WGI, the Companys obligations depend on the extent to which the Company has any outstanding Support Agreements. The contracts rejected by WGI included four large fixed price international turnkey projects that were close to completion. Construction has been completed on these projects and they are now in the commercial closeout and claims resolution phase. The Company recorded a charge of $18 million in 2002 related to warranty and start up costs associated with the last project to be completed. In 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $54 million related to these projects. The contracts rejected by WGI also included two large construction projects that have been provisionally accepted by the customer (Red Oak and Ilijan) on which the Company had Support Agreements. In 2002, the Company recorded a charge of $14 million related to final reliability testing and punch list items. The Company also recorded a charge of $21 million resulting from a contract adjustment on one of these projects due to turbine related delays. In 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $156 million related to these and the other WGI construction projects on which the Company has Support Agreements. Risks and exposures on the contracts rejected by WGI include equipment and subcontractor performance, punch list and warranty closeout and performance, schedule and performance liquidated damages, final resolution of contract closeout issues, collection of amounts due under the contracts, potential adverse claims resolution including possible subcontractor claims, lease exposures, availability guarantees, surety bonds, and warranties. For the contracts assumed by WGI, the Companys obligations under existing Support Agreements would arise if WGI does not meet the obligations that it has assumed. Risks on the contracts assumed by WGI that are subject to Support Agreements relate to non performance or defaults by WGI. The Companys cost estimates for construction projects are heavily dependent upon third parties, including WGI, and their ability to perform construction management and other tasks that require industry expertise the Company no longer possesses. In addition, there are risks that the ultimate costs to complete and close out the projects will increase beyond the Companys current estimates due to factors such as labor productivity and availability of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the impact of change orders, the recoverability of claims included in the ETC, and the outcome of defending claims asserted against the Company. There also are claims asserted against the Company by vendors, subcontractors, and other project participants that are not beneficiaries of the Support Agreements. A significant change in an estimate on one or more of the projects could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In 2002, the Company allocated $79 million of interest expense to RE&C versus $18 million in 2001. Interest expense was allocated to RE&C based upon actual cash outflows since the date of disposition. The Company will not allocate interest expense to RE&C in 29 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations continued 2003. In 2002, the Company recorded charges of $38 million for legal, management, and other costs versus $30 million in 2001. In 2002, 2001, and 2000, the pretax loss from discontinued operations related to RE&C was $966 million, $1,143 million, and $513 million, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations related to RE&C was $1,129 million in 2002 versus $635 million in 2001 and $100 million in 2000. The Company expects its operating cash flow to be negatively affected by approximately $300 million to $375 million in 2003 which includes project completion, legal, and management costs related to RE&C. Further increases in project costs may increase the estimated operating cash outflow for RE&C in 2003. Financial Condition and Liquidity Net cash provided by operating activities in 2002 was $1,039 million versus $193 million in 2001 and $980 million in 2000. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $2,235 million in 2002 versus $789 million in 2001 and $1,009 million in 2000. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2002 was due to better working capital management at the defense businesses, better inventory management at Raytheon Aircraft, a $156 million tax refund received as a result of the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002, and $95 million received from the closeout of the Companys interest rate swaps, described below in Capital Structure and Resources. The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2001 was due to an increase in used aircraft inventory at Raytheon Aircraft resulting from lower demand for new and used aircraft, advance payments received in 2000, and accelerated collections on several large programs in 2000. Net cash used in investing activities was $719 million in 2002 versus $47 million in 2001 and $213 million in 2000. The Company provides long term financing to its aircraft customers and maintained a program under which it sold general aviation and commuter aircraft long term receivables under a receivables purchase facility, described below in Off Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements. Origination of financing receivables was $431 million in 2002, $663 million in 2001, and $969 million in 2000. Sale of financing receivables was $263 million in 2002, $696 million in 2001, and $1,034 million in 2000. Repurchase of financing receivables was $347 million in 2002, $329 million in 2001, and $258 million in 2000. Since the receivables purchase facility no longer provided any real economic benefit, the Company bought out the receivables that remained in the facility in 2002 for $1,029 million, eliminating the cost of maintaining it, and brought the related assets onto the Companys books. Capital expenditures were $458 million in 2002, $461 million in 2001, and $421 million in 2000. Capital expenditures in 2003 are expected to approximate $500 million. Proceeds from sales of property, plant, and equipment were $11 million in 2002, $9 million in 2001, and $40 million in 2000. Expenditures for internal use software were $138 million in 2002, $149 million in 2001, and $110 million in 2000. Expenditures for internal use software in 2003 are expected to approximate $95 million as the Company continues to convert significant portions of its existing financial systems to a new integrated financial package. Proceeds from the sale of operating units and investments were $1,166 million in 2002 versus $266 million in 2001, and $403 million in 2000. In 2002, the Company sold its AIS business for $1,123 million, described above in Discontinued Operations, and an investment for $43 million, described below in Major Affiliated Entities. In 2001, the Company sold a majority interest in its aviation support business for $154 million, its recreational marine business for $100 million, and other investments for $12 million. Total sales and operating income related to these divested businesses were $248 million and $13 million, respectively, in 2001. In 2000, The Company sold its RE&C business for $73 million, described above in Discontinued Operations. The Company also sold its flight simulation business for $160 million, its optical systems business for $153 million, and other non core business operations for $17 million. Total sales and operating income related to these divested businesses (excluding RE&C) were $166 million and $2 million, respectively, in 2000. In October 2001, the Company and Hughes&reg; Electronics Corporation agreed to a settlement regarding the purchase price adjustment related to the Companys 1997 merger with Hughes Defense. Under the terms of the agreement, Hughes Electronics agreed to reimburse the Company approximately $635 million of its purchase price, with $500 million received in 2001 and the balance received in 2002. The settlement resulted in a $555 million reduction in goodwill. The $135 million receivable was included in prepaid expenses and other current assets at December 31, 2001. Net cash used in financing activities was $990 million in 2002 versus net cash provided of $197 million in 2001 and net cash used of $126 million in 2000. Dividends paid to stockholders were $321 million in 2002, $281 million in 2001, and $272 million in 2000. The quarterly dividend rate was $0.20 per share for each of the four quarters of 2002, 2001, and 2000. Capital Structure and Resources Total debt was $7.4 billion at December 31, 2002 and $8.2 billion at December 31, 2001. Cash and cash equivalents were $544 million at December 31, 2002 and $1,214 million at December 31, 2001. The Companys outstanding debt has interest rates ranging from 4.5% to 8.3% and matures at various dates through 2028. Total debt as a percentage of total capital was 43.3 percent and 40.2 percent at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In 2002, the Company issued $575 million of long term debt to reduce the amounts outstanding under the Companys lines of credit. Also in 2002, the Company repurchased debt with a par value of $96 million. In addition, the Company eliminated its $1.4 billion receivables purchase facility in 2002, described below in Off Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements. The Company has on file a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering the issuance of up to $2.4 billion in debt securities, common or preferred stock, warrants to purchase any of the aforementioned securities, and or stock purchase contracts. In 2001, the Company entered into various interest rate swaps that corresponded to a portion of the Companys fixed rate debt in order to effectively hedge interest rate risk. The $1.2 billion notional value of the interest rate swaps effectively converted approximately 15 percent of the Companys total debt to variable rate debt. In 2002, the Company closed out these interest rate swaps in order to reduce market rate risk. The Company received proceeds of $95 million in 2002 for the fair value of the swaps. The $95 million of value will be amortized over the remaining life of the corresponding debt as a reduction to interest expense. Also in 2001, the Company repurchased long term debt with a par value of $1,375 million. In 2000, the Company issued $2.25 billion of long term debt to repay outstanding short term debt, extending the maturity of the Companys debt obligations. Also in 2000, the Company issued $350 million of floating rate notes due in 2001 to partially refinance $500 million of long term debt that matured in 2000. The Companys most restrictive bank agreement covenant is an interest coverage ratio that currently requires earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), excluding certain charges, to be at least 2.5 times net interest expense for the prior four quarters. In July 2002, the covenant was amended to exclude charges of $450 million related to discontinued operations. The Company was in compliance with the interest coverage ratio covenant, as amended, during 2002 and expects to continue to be in compliance throughout 2003. Credit ratings for the Company were assigned by Fitchs at F3 for short term borrowing and BBB for senior debt, by Moodys at P 3 for short term borrowing and Baa3 for senior debt, and by Standard and Poors at A 3 for short term borrowing and BBB for senior debt. Lines of credit with certain commercial banks exist to provide short term liquidity. The lines of credit bear interest based upon LIBOR and were $2.85 billion at December 31, 2002, consisting of $1.55 billion which matures in November 2003, and $1.3 billion which matures in 2006. The lines of credit were $2.4 billion at December 31, 2001. There were no borrowings under the lines of credit at December 31, 2002, however, the Company had $306 million of outstanding letters of credit which reduced the Companys borrowing capacity under the lines of credit to $2.5 billion. There was $140 million outstanding under the lines of credit at December 31, 2001. Credit lines with banks are also maintained by certain foreign subsidiaries to provide them with a limited amount of short term liquidity. These lines of credit were $79 million and $129 million at December 31, 2002 and 2001, 30 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations continued respectively. There was $1 million and $26 million outstanding under these lines of credit at December 31, 2002 and 2001, respectively. In addition, the Company maintains other credit and synthetic lease facilities, described below in Off Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements. In May 2001, the Company issued 17,250,000, 8.25% equity security units for $50 per unit totaling $837 million, net of offering costs of $26 million. The net proceeds of the offering were used to reduce debt and for general corporate purposes. Each equity security unit consists of a contract to purchase shares of the Companys common stock on May 15, 2004, which will result in cash proceeds to the Company of $863 million, and a mandatorily redeemable equity security, with a stated liquidation amount of $50, due on May 15, 2006, which will require a cash payment by the Company of $863 million. The contract obligates the holder to purchase, for $50, shares of common stock equal to the settlement rate. The settlement rate is equal to $50 divided by the average market value of the Companys common stock at that time. The settlement rate cannot be greater than 1.8182 or less than 1.4903 shares of common stock per purchase contract. Using the treasury stock method, there is no effect on the computation of shares for diluted earnings per share if the average market value of the Companys common stock is between $27.50 and $33.55 per share. For example, if the Companys average stock price during the period was $40 per share, the diluted shares outstanding would increase by 4.1 million shares or one percent of total shares outstanding at December 31, 2002. At an average stock price of $45 per share, the diluted shares outstanding would increase by 6.5 million shares, or two percent. During 2002, the average market value of the Companys common stock was $35.41 per share, therefore, the Company included 1.4 million shares in its computation of shares for diluted earnings per share. In May 2001, the Company issued 14,375,000 shares of common stock for $27.50 per share. In October 2001, the Company issued 31,578,900 shares of common stock for $33.25 per share. The proceeds of the offerings were $1,388 million, net of $56 million of offering costs, and were used to reduce debt and for general corporate purposes. In 2001, the Company eliminated its dual class capital structure and reclassified its Class A and Class B common stock into a single new class of common stock. The Company also effected a 20 for 1 reverse forward stock split that resulted in holders of fewer than 20 shares of common stock being cashed out of their holdings. The Companys need for, cost of, and access to funds are dependent on future operating results, as well as conditions external to the Company. Cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, proceeds from divestitures, and other available financing resources are expected to be sufficient to meet anticipated operating, capital expenditure, and debt service requirements during the next twelve months. Major Affiliated Entities Investments, which are included in other assets, consisted of the following at December 31: (In millions) Ownership% 2002 2001 Equity method investments TRS 50.0 $ 59 $ 18 HRL&reg; 33.3 29 28 HAL 49.0 13 7 Indra 49.0 12 12 Raytheon Aerospace 25.9 5 TelASIC 22.8 2 Flight Options 49.9 Space Imaging 30.9 48 Raytheon Espa&ntilde;a 38 120 151 Other investments Alliance Laundry Systems 19 19 Other 15 11 34 30 Total $ 154 $ 181 In 1995, through the acquisition of E Systems&reg;, Inc., the Company invested in Space Imaging and currently has a 31 percent equity investment in Space Imaging LLC. Since 1996, the Company has guaranteed a portion of Space Imagings debt and currently guarantees 50 percent of a $300 million Space Imaging credit facility that matures in March 2003. There were $277 million of Space Imaging borrowings outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2002. In 2002, the Company recorded a $175 million charge to write off the Companys investment in Space Imaging and accrue for the credit facility guarantee on which the Company expects to make payment in 2003. The charge was a result of the Companys and Space Imagings other major investors decision not to provide additional funding at this time, whereby the Company does not believe that Space Imaging will be able to repay amounts outstanding under the credit facility. To date, Space Imaging has purchased a significant amount of equipment from its major investors, including the Company. The Companys outstanding receivables due from Space Imaging totaled $28 million at December 31, 2002. Space Imaging is pursuing its business plan, including assessments relative to future investment in a replacement satellite system and related funding requirements. Space Imaging was recently successful in obtaining certain long term commitments from the U.S. government for purchases of commercial satellite imagery. In order to fund future replacement satellites, Space Imaging will likely need, but has not yet been able to obtain, commitments for additional funding. In light of current market conditions and those uncertainties, there can be no assurance that Space Imaging will be successful in attracting additional funding. In 2002, the Company formed a joint venture with Flight Options, Inc. whereby the Company contributed its Raytheon Travel Air&reg; fractional ownership business and loaned the new entity $20 million. The Companys investment in and other assets related to the joint venture totaled $107 million at December 31, 2002, which includes equity losses the Company has recorded since the formation of the joint venture. There was approximately $59 million of collateral value underlying amounts due from Flight Options at December 31, 2002. In addition, there was approximately $88 million of additional transaction related receivables that the Company recorded at zero due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of those amounts, due to the fact that the new entity, Flight Options LLC (FO), has been unprofitable to date and has not been generating adequate cash flow to finance current operations. Given these operating results, the Company has loaned FO an additional $10 million since December 31, 2002. FO had been pursuing additional equity financing, but was not successful in that regard. As a result, the Company offered to exchange the FO debt it currently holds for additional equity in the joint venture, restructure other debt, and invest additional funds for additional equity. If this restructuring is completed, the Company will be responsible for FOs operations, own a majority of FOs stock, and consolidate FOs results in the Companys financial statements. Negotiations related to the restructuring are ongoing. If the Company consolidates Flight Options, it is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations, although the Company would reduce its reported Aircraft backlog by approximately $850 million related to an order received from Flight Options in 2002. In addition, the Companys reported revenue, operating income, and other expense would change as a result of the consolidation of Flight Options results. Flight Options customers, in certain instances, have the contractual ability to require Flight Options to buy back their fractional share based on its current fair market value. The estimated value of this potential obligation was approximately $530 million at December 31, 2002. In 2002, the Company sold its investment in Raytheon Espa&ntilde;a for $43 million and recorded a gain of $4 million. Also in 2002, the Company agreed to provide $30 million of financing to JT3, L.L.C., a joint venture formed by the Company to provide range support to the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy, under which $21 million was outstanding at December 31, 2002. This financing is collateralized by JT3s customer receivables. In 2001, the Company formed a joint venture, Thales Raytheon Systems (TRS), that has two major operating subsidiaries, one of which the Company controls and consolidates. In addition, the Company has entered into joint ventures formed specifically to facilitate a teaming arrangement between two contractors for the benefit of the customer, generally the U.S. government, whereby the Company receives a subcontract from the joint 31 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations continued venture in its capacity as prime contractor. Accordingly, the Company records the work it performs for the joint venture as operating activity. Certain joint ventures are not included in the table above as the Companys investment in these entities is less than $1 million. In 2001, the Company sold a majority interest in its aviation support business (Raytheon Aerospace) and retained $66 million in preferred and common equity in the business. The $66 million represents a 26 percent stake and was recorded at zero because the new entity is highly leveraged. This initial investment will remain at zero until the new entity generates enough cash flow to show that the new entity will be able to liquidate the Companys investment after satisfying its third party debt service payments. The $5 million investment balance noted above represents equity income the Company has recorded since the date of disposition. The Company also has a 20 percent equity investment in Exostar LLC. Due to equity method losses recorded since formation, substantially all of the Companys investment in Exostar has been written off. In 1998, the Company sold its commercial laundry business unit to Alliance Laundry Systems for $315 million in cash and $19 million in securities. Commitments and Contingencies Defense contractors are subject to many levels of audit and investigation. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Department of Defense Inspector General, the General Accounting Office, the Department of Justice, and Congressional Committees. The Department of Justice, from time to time, has convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by the Company. Individually and in the aggregate, these investigations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In 2002, the Company received service of a grand jury subpoena issued by the United States District Court for the District of California. The subpoena seeks documents related to the activities of an international sales representative engaged by the Company related to a foreign military sales contract in Korea in the late 1990s. The Company has in place appropriate compliance policies and procedures, and believes its conduct has been consistent with those policies and procedures. The Company is cooperating fully with the investigation. The Company continues to cooperate with the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on an investigation related to the Companys accounting practices primarily related to the commuter aircraft business and the timing of revenue recognition at Raytheon Aircraft from 1997 to 2001. The Company has been providing documents and information to the SEC staff. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigation or any action that the SEC might take. In late 1999, the Company and two of its officers were named as defendants in several class action lawsuits which were consolidated into a single complaint in June 2000, when four additional former or present officers were named as defendants (the Consolidated Complaint). The Consolidated Complaint principally alleges that the defendants violated federal securities laws by making misleading statements and by failing to disclose material information concerning the Companys financial performance during the class period of October 7, 1998 through October 12, 1999. In March 2002, the court certified the class of plaintiffs as those people who purchased the Companys stock between October 7, 1998 and October 12, 1999. In September 2000, the Company and the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss, which the plaintiffs opposed. The court heard arguments on the motion in February 2001. In August 2001, the court issued an order dismissing most of the claims asserted against the Company and the individual defendants. Discovery is proceeding on the two circumstances that remain the subject of claims. In 1999 and 2000, the Company was also named as a nominal defendant and all of its directors at the time (except one) were named as defendants in purported derivative lawsuits. The derivative complaints contain allegations similar to those included in the Consolidated Complaint and further allege that the defendants breached fiduciary duties to the Company and allegedly failed to exercise due care and diligence in the management and administration of the affairs of the Company. In December 2001, the Company and the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss one of the derivative lawsuits. These actions have since been consolidated, and the plaintiffs have filed a consolidated amended complaint. The defendants have advised the court that they intend to file a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. In June 2001, a purported class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of all purchasers of common stock or senior notes of WGI during the class period of April 17, 2000 through March 1, 2001 (the WGI Complaint). The plaintiff class claims to have suffered harm by purchasing WGI securities because the Company and certain of its officers allegedly violated federal securities laws by misrepresenting the true financial condition of RE&C in order to sell RE&C to WGI at an artificially inflated price. An amended complaint was filed in October 2001 alleging similar claims. The Company and the individual defendants filed a motion seeking to dismiss the action in November 2001. In April 2002, the motion to dismiss was denied. The defendants have filed their answer to the amended complaint and discovery is proceeding. In July 2001, the Company was named as a nominal defendant and all of its directors at the time have been named as defendants in two identical purported derivative lawsuits. The derivative complaints contain allegations similar to those included in the WGI Complaint and further allege that the individual defendants breached fiduciary duties to the Company and failed to maintain systems necessary for prudent management and control of the Companys operations. In December 2001, the Company and the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss one of the derivative lawsuits. Also in July 2001, the Company was named as a nominal defendant and members of its Board of Directors and several current and former officers have been named as defendants in another purported shareholder derivative action which contains allegations similar to those included in the WGI Complaint and further alleges that the individual defendants breached fiduciary duties to the Company and failed to maintain systems necessary for prudent management and control of the Companys operations. In June 2002, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In September 2002, the plaintiff agreed to voluntarily dismiss this action without prejudice so that it can be re filed in another jurisdiction. Although the Company believes that it and the other defendants have meritorious defenses to each and all of the aforementioned class action and derivative complaints and intends to contest each lawsuit vigorously, an adverse resolution of any of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations in the period in which the lawsuits are resolved. The Company is not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses, if any, related to any of the lawsuits. In addition, various claims and legal proceedings generally incidental to the normal course of business are pending or threatened against the Company. While the ultimate liability from these proceedings is presently indeterminable, any additional liability is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. The Company is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to remediation of various environmental sites. The Companys estimate of total environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred is $143 million. On a discounted basis, the Company estimates the liability to be $92 million before U.S. government recovery and has accrued this amount at December 31, 2002. A portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. The recovery of environmental cleanup costs from the U.S. government is considered probable based on the Companys long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs. Accordingly, the Company has recorded $49 million at December 31, 2002 for the estimated future recovery of these costs from the U.S. government, which is included in contracts in process. Due to the complexity of environmental laws and regulations, the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup methods and technologies, the uncertainty of insurance coverage, and the unresolved extent of the Companys responsibility, it is difficult to determine the ultimate outcome of these matters, however, any additional liability is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. 32 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations continued In 1997, the Company provided a first loss guarantee of $133 million on $1.3 billion of U.S. Export Import Bank debt through 2015 related to the Brazilian governments System for the Vigilance of the Amazon (SIVAM) program. The following is a schedule of the Companys contractual obligations outstanding at December 31, 2002: (In millions) Total Less than 1 Year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Debt $ 7,433 $ 1,153 $ 1,129 $ 1,943 $ 3,208 Interest payments 3,752 476 835 605 1,836 Operating leases 1,498 421 422 306 349 IT outsourcing 458 66 135 128 129 Synthetic lease obligations 138 138 Equity security units (ESU) (863 ) 863 ESU distributions 227 71 126 30 Total $ 13,506 $ 2,325 $ 1,784 $ 3,875 $ 5,522 Interest payments include interest on debt that is redeemable at the option of the Company. The following is a schedule of the Companys other potential commitments outstanding at December 31, 2002: (In millions) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 Years 4 5 Years After 5 Years Letters of credit $ 860 $ 502 $ 267 $ 58 $ 33 Debt guarantees 283 150 133 Discontinued operations 736 192 120 54 370 Letters of credit are issued by banks and insurance companies on the Companys behalf to meet various bid, performance, warranty, retention, and advance payment obligations primarily related to defense customers. Debt guarantees consist of the Space Imaging loan facility guarantee of $150 million and the SIVAM guarantee of $133 million, described above. Discontinued operations consist of letters of credit, performance bonds, and parent guarantees of performance and payment on certain long term construction contracts, described above in Discontinued Operations, however, additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no maximum stated value also remain outstanding. Off Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements The following amounts were outstanding under the Companys off balance sheet receivables facilities at December 31: (In millions) 2002 2001 2000 Aircraft Receivables Facility $ 1 $ 1,448 $ 1,755 Government Receivables Facility 25 Total $ 1 $ 1,448 $ 1,780 The Company provides long term financing to its aircraft customers and maintained a program under which an indirect subsidiary of the Company sold general aviation and commuter aircraft long term receivables to Raytheon Aircraft Receivables Corporation (RARC), a special purpose entity. RARC sold undivided interests in the receivables to a bank syndicate and other financial institutions that purchased these interests for cash under a receivables purchase facility (the Aircraft Receivables Facility). The purchasers had a first priority claim on all proceeds, including the underlying aircraft and any insurance proceeds, and had recourse against the Company, at varying percentages, depending upon the character of the receivables sold. Since the Aircraft Receivables facility no longer provided any real economic benefit, the Company bought out the receivables that remained in this facility in 2002, eliminating the cost of maintaining it, and brought the related assets onto the Companys books. The $1 million balance in this facility at December 31, 2002 represented a remaining security interest in certain aircraft whose title had not yet been transferred back to the Company. In 1998, the Company entered into a $490 million property sale and five year operating lease (synthetic lease) facility. Under this lease facility property, plant, and equipment was sold and leased back in order to diversify the Companys sources of funding and extend the term of a portion of the Companys financing obligations. In 2003, the Company is required to buy back the assets remaining in the lease facility for $138 million. Remaining lease payments under the lease facility at December 31, 2002 total $28 million in 2003. Critical Accounting Policies The Company has identified the following accounting policies that require significant judgment. The Company believes its judgments related to these accounting policies are appropriate. Sales under long term contracts are recorded under the percentage of completion method. Costs and estimated gross margins are recorded as sales as work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs utilizing the most recent estimates of costs and funding. Cost estimates include direct and indirect costs such as labor, material, warranty, and overhead. Some contracts contain incentive provisions based upon performance in relation to established targets which are recognized in the contract estimates when deemed realizable. Contract change orders and claims are included in sales when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable. Due to the long term nature of many of the Companys programs, developing the estimates of costs and funding often requires significant judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include labor productivity and availability of labor, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the impact of change orders, availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, and the recoverability of claims included in any estimate to complete. In 2002, 2001, and 2000, operating income as a percent of net sales for the Companys defense businesses did not vary by more than 0.5 percent. If the aggregate combined cost estimates for all of the contracts in the Companys defense businesses had been higher or lower by 0.5 percent in 2002, the Companys operating income would have changed by approximately $50 million to $75 million. As described above in Discontinued Operations, the Companys cost estimates for construction projects are heavily dependent upon third parties and their ability to perform construction management and other tasks that require industry expertise the Company no longer possesses. Identified risks related to the two Massachusetts construction projects, also described above in Discontinued Operations, include the possibility of further delays, reduced labor productivity, and the timely successful completion of required performance tests on the two projects. Historically, the Company has experienced problems associated with these identified risks. The current schedule calls for the successful completion of the performance tests at the Mystic Station plant in April and May 2003 and the Fore River plant in May 2003. If the Company is unable to meet these dates, the costs on these projects could increase materially. The current estimate also assumes the recovery of pre funded liquidated damages totaling $48 million related to these two projects. While the Company expects to recover these pre funded liquidated damages from the customer, failure to do so would require an additional charge equal to the amount of pre funded liquidated damages the Company is unable to recover. The Company uses lot accounting for new aircraft introductions. Lot accounting involves selecting an initial lot size at the time a new aircraft begins to ship and measuring an average cost over the entire lot for each aircraft sold. The costs attributed to aircraft delivered are based on the estimated average cost of all aircraft expected to be produced and are determined under the learning curve concept which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition. Once production costs stabilize, which is expected by the time the initial lot has been completed, the use of lot accounting is discontinued. The selection of lot size is a critical judgment. The Company determines lot size based on several factors, including the size of firm backlog, the expected annual production on the aircraft, and experience on 33 Table of Contents Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations continued similar new aircraft. The size of the initial lot for the Beechcraft Premier I, the only aircraft the Company is currently utilizing lot accounting for, is 200 units. The estimated average cost of the aircraft is reviewed and reassessed quarterly and changes in estimates are recognized over future deliveries remaining in the lot, however, the Company is not currently recording profit on aircraft sales in the initial lot. A 5 percent increase in the estimated cost to produce the aircraft would reduce the Companys operating income by approximately $50 million. The valuation of used aircraft in inventories, which are stated at the lower of cost or market, requires significant judgment. As part of its assessment of fair value, the Company must evaluate many factors including current market conditions, future market conditions, the age and condition of the aircraft, and availability levels for the aircraft in the market. A 10 percent decrease in the aggregate market value of used aircraft in inventory at December 31, 2002 would result in an impairment charge of approximately $15 million. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets, upon indication of possible impairment, by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the related estimated undiscounted cash flows. When an evaluation indicates that the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets, the asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value. The determination of what constitutes an indication of possible impairment, the estimation of future cash flows, and the determination of estimated fair value are all significant judgments. In addition, the company performs an annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year. In connection with the reorganization of the Companys government and defense businesses, described above in Segment Reorganization, the Company reallocated goodwill to the newly formed segments based upon an estimate of the fair value of the portion of a previously acquired company contribution to the new segment and performed an initial goodwill impairment test. The Company estimated the fair value of the new segments using a discounted cash flow model based on the Companys most recent five year plan and compared the estimated fair value to the net book value of the segment, including goodwill. There was no indication of goodwill impairment as a result of this initial test. Preparation of forecasts for use in the five year plan involves significant judgments. Changes in these forecasts could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the Companys segments and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. The Company has pension and retirement plans covering the majority of its employees, including certain employees in foreign countries. The selection of the assumptions used to determine pension expense or income in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS No. 87) involves significant judgment. The investment performance of the Companys pension plan assets for the year ended October 31, 2002, the measurement date for the Companys pension plans, of (4.5)% did not meet the Companys long term return on asset (ROA) assumption under SFAS No. 87 of 9.5% per annum. Due to changes in the extended outlook of the investment markets, the Company has reduced the long term ROA assumption to 8.75%. The Companys long term ROA assumption is based on target asset allocations of 60% equities with a 10.5% expected return, 30% fixed income with a 5.4% expected return, and 10% other (including real estate, venture capital, and cash) with an 8.3% expected return. Current allocations are within 3% of the target for each category. In addition, due to changes in the interest rate environment, the Company has reduced the discount rate to 7.0% from 7.25%. As a result, the Companys SFAS No. 87 pension expense is expected to be approximately $300 million in 2003 and $625 million in 2004. If the Company adjusts both the long term ROA assumption and the discount rate for 2004 up or down by 25 basis points, the Companys SFAS No. 87 pension expense would change by approximately $50 million. In selecting the long term ROA and discount rate, which are considered to be the key variables in determining pension expense or income, the Company considers both current market conditions and expected future market trends, including changes in interest rates and equity market performance. The Company currently estimates that cash contributions to the pension plans will be approximately $60 million in 2003 and $360 million in 2004. Accounting Standards In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46). This interpretation addresses the consolidation of certain variable interest entities (VIEs) for which a controlling financial interest exists. FIN 46 applies immediately to financial interests obtained in VIEs after January 31, 2003. It applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after June 15, 2003, to VIEs in which a financial interest was obtained before February 1, 2003. FIN 46 may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment or by restating previously issued financial statements with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated. The effect of adopting FIN 46 on the Companys financial position and results of operations has not yet been determined. In November 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of indebtedness of Others, an interpretation of FASB Statements No. 5, 57 and 107 and rescission of FASB Interpretation No. 34 (FIN 45). This interpretation clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. It also elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued. The recognition and measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002. The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for financial statements of periods ending after December 15, 2002. The effect of adopting the recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 on the Companys financial position and results of operations has not yet been determined. In June 2002, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities (SFAS No. 146) which nullifies Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 94 3, Liability Recognition for Certain Employee Termination Benefits and Other Costs to Exit an Activity (including Certain Costs Incurred in a Restructuring). This accounting standard, which is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after December 31, 2002, addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities. The adoption of SFAS No. 146 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. 34 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys primary market exposures are to interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company meets its working capital requirements with a combination of variable rate short term and fixed rate long term financing. The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements with commercial and investment banks primarily to manage interest rates associated with the Companys financing arrangements. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts with commercial banks only to fix the dollar value of specific commitments and payments to international vendors and the value of foreign currency denominated receipts. The market risk sensitive instruments used by the Company for hedging are entered into with commercial and investment banks and are directly related to a particular asset, liability, or transaction for which a firm commitment is in place. The Company has used a special purpose entity to sell aircraft receivables and retains a partial interest that includes servicing rights, interest only strips, and subordinated certificates. Financial instruments held by the Company which are subject to interest rate risk include notes payable, long term debt, long term receivables, investments, and interest rate swap agreements. There was no aggregate after tax hypothetical loss in earnings for one year of those financial instruments held by the Company at December 31, 2002 which are subject to interest rate risk resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rate of 10 percent. The aggregate hypothetical loss in earnings for one year of those financial instruments held by the Company at December 31, 2001 and 2000, which are subject to interest rate risk resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 10 percent, was $2 million and $3 million, respectively, after tax. The hypothetical loss was determined by calculating the aggregate impact of a 10 percent increase in the interest rate of each variable rate financial instrument held by the Company at December 31, 2002 and December 31, 2001, which was subject to interest rate risk. Fixed rate financial instruments were not evaluated, as the risk exposure is not material. 35 Table of Contents
