Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Raytheon Company (the Company) is one of the largest defense electronics contractors in the world, serving all branches of the U.S. military and other U.S. government agencies, NATO, and many allied governments. The Company is a leader in defense electronics, including missiles; radar; sensors and electro optics; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR); command, control, communication, and information systems; naval systems; air traffic control systems; and technical services. The Companys defense businesses are well positioned to capitalize on emerging opportunities in missile defense; precision engagement; intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance; and homeland security. Due to the multi year defense spending cycle, recent increased budget authorizations in these areas are expected to favorably impact the Companys defense businesses over the next several years. Raytheon Aircraft is a leading provider of business and special mission aircraft and delivers a broad line of jet, turboprop, and piston powered airplanes to individual, corporate, and government customers worldwide. Defense Industry Considerations Recent events, including the global War on Terrorism, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom, have altered the defense and security environment of the United States. These events have had, and for the foreseeable future are likely to continue to have, a significant impact on the markets for defense and advanced technology systems and products. The U.S. Department of Defense continues to focus on both supporting ongoing operations and transforming our military to confront future threats. Our customers plan to operate in a new paradigm. They define an approach that emphasizes speed, precision, and flexibility, by sharing superior knowledge, enabling forces to seize and sustain initiative, concentrate combat power, and prevent an enemy response. In this new environment, the need for advanced technology and defense electronics is clear. The recent growth in military expenditures is driven by the multi pronged approach required to fight the War on Terrorism, replenish war materials consumed during continued operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and sustain the momentum in pursuit of transformation. The Companys strategy is designed to capitalize on the breadth and depth of the Companys technology and extensive domain expertise in order to meet the evolving needs of the Companys customers. The Company is focusing on the following Strategic Business Areas, which are aligned with the ongoing military operations and Department of Defense transformation goals: Missile Defense Precision Engagement Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Homeland Security Missile Defense The Company provides an extensive array of technologies and is a major partner in missile defense. The Company is committed to helping the U.S. Missile Defense Agency, the organization responsible for developing an operational Ballistic Missile Defense System achieve its objectives. The Presidents commitment to have a U.S. missile defense system operational by 2004 is reinforced by the increase in emphasis and funding in the latest budgets. The Companys broad array of technologies covers all three phases of the missile defense system boost, midcourse, and terminal defense and includes Standard Missile 3, Space Tracking and Surveillance System, Cobra Judy, Exo Atmospheric Kill Vehicle, Early Warning Radar, Sea Based X Band Radar, High Power Discriminator, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, and Patriot. Precision Engagement The Company provides mission solutions across the entire precision engagement chain. The Companys customers are increasingly looking for mission solutions that address the need to operate jointly (across services and between allied forces), work in a new net centric paradigm, minimize collateral damage, and strike time sensitive targets. The Companys precision engagement systems include: U 2 sensor suite, F 15 and F/A 18 Active Electronically Scanned Array radars, Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile, Situation Awareness Data Link, NetFires, Joint Standoff Weapon, Paveway, Tactical Tomahawk, F/A 18 Radar Warning Receiver, High Power Microwave, and High Energy Lasers. Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance The Companys innovative sensing, processing, and dissemination technologies effectively compress the information gap from hours to minutes. The Company provides integrated systems solutions for observing, locating, processing, deciding, and disseminating actionable information, enabling network centric operations for decision makers. These abilities are crucial for war fighters to achieve information dominance throughout the entire battlespace. The Companys key ISR programs include: Global Hawk sensor suite, E 10A Battle Management Command and Control, Space Based Radar, National Polar orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite Systems, Future Combat Systems, DD(X), and numerous classified programs. Homeland Security In the area of Homeland Security, the Company has skills, experience, and technology in areas such as airport security; command, control, and communication; and the integration and fusion of sensory inputs for real time decision support. This is still a new market with significant uncertainty and the ultimate customers and available funding have yet to be determined. 25 Table of Contents Unlike many major defense contractors, the Company provides electronics for a wide range of missions and platforms. The Company has several thousand programs which the Company believes reduces some of the risk and volatility often inherent in the defense industry. The Company generally acts as a prime contractor or subcontractor on its programs. The funding of U.S. government programs is subject to Congressional authorization and appropriation. While Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis, major defense programs are usually conducted under binding contracts over multiple years. The termination of funding for a U.S. government program could result in a loss of future revenues, which would have a negative effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations. U.S. government contracts are also subject to oversight audits and contain provisions for termination. Failure to comply with U.S. government regulations could lead to suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting. Sales to the U.S. government may be affected by changes in procurement policies, budget considerations, changing defense requirements, and political developments. The influence of these factors, which are largely beyond the Companys control, could impact the Companys financial position or results of operations. Aircraft Industry Considerations The health of the markets for Raytheon Aircrafts products and services is influenced by a number of key economic and environmental factors including: Economic growth or sustained market stability The industry wide level of inventory of used aircraft available for sale Regulatory and environmental factors including continued open access to national airspace and airports and operational equipment requirements Introduction of new products While the economy has shown signs of recovery by most measures including GDP, corporate profits, and personal disposable income, the general aviation market continues to be depressed from its peak performance in 2001. Historically, the industry has lagged the U.S. economic recovery by 12 18 months. Traditionally, the used aircraft market has led the recovery of the new aircraft market by approximately nine months, however, the current size of the worldwide fleet of used aircraft available for sale and a slower economic recovery could delay market demand for new aircraft. The size of the worldwide fleet of used aircraft available for sale has created intense price pressure on new aircraft and, as a result, many manufacturers have reduced line or production rates to avoid oversupplying the market with products that will only be moved through deep discounting. To support a recovery of the new aircraft market, the current worldwide inventory of used aircraft must be reduced. Despite the increased activity in the used aircraft market during the last half of 2003 and strong fourth quarter sales activity for new aircraft, driven in large part by the bonus depreciation benefit of the Jobs Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, the industry consensus is that the market for new aircraft will remain flat to slightly higher through 2005 with a modest recovery beginning in 2006. Financial Summary As discussed in more detail throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: Gross bookings were $22.7 billion in 2003, $17.9 billion in 2002, and $17.0 billion in 2001 resulting in backlog of $27.5 billion, $25.7 billion, and $25.6 billion at December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Backlog represents future sales and cash flow that will be recognized over the next several years. Net sales were $18.1 billion in 2003, $16.8 billion in 2002, and $16.0 billion in 2001. The increase in sales was a result of strong growth at the defense businesses, primarily Integrated Defense Systems, Missile Systems, and Space and Airborne Systems. Operating income was $1.3 billion in 2003, $1.8 billion in 2002, and $0.8 billion in 2001. Operating income as a percent of net sales was 7.3 percent, 10.6 percent, and 4.8 percent in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. Included in operating income was a FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment, described below in Consolidated Results of Operations, of $109 million of expense in 2003, $210 million of income in 2002, and $386 million of income in 2001. The FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment in 2004 is expected to be approximately $450 million of expense. Also included in operating income were 2003 charges at Network Centric Systems and Technical Services of $276 million, 2001 charges at Raytheon Airline Aviation Services of $745 million, and 2001 goodwill amortization of $334 million. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $2.1 billion in 2003, $2.2 billion in 2002, and $0.8 billion in 2001. The increase from 2001 was due to better working capital management at the defense businesses and better inventory management at Raytheon Aircraft. Although the Company will continue to focus on working capital management at the defense businesses, this level of improvement is not expected to continue into the foreseeable future. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company has identified the following accounting policies that require significant judgment. The Company believes its judgments related to these accounting policies are appropriate. Sales under long term government contracts are recorded under the percentage of completion method. Incurred costs and estimated gross margins are recorded as sales as work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs using the Companys estimates of costs and contract value. Cost estimates include direct and indirect costs 26 Table of Contents such as labor, materials, warranty, and overhead. Some contracts contain incentive provisions based upon performance in relation to established targets which are included at estimated realizable value. Contract change orders and claims are included when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable. Due to the long term nature of many of the Companys programs, developing estimates of costs and contract value often requires significant judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the impact of change orders, availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, award fee estimations, and the recoverability of claims. In 2003, 2002, and 2001, operating income as a percent of net sales for the defense businesses did not vary by more than 1.5 percent. If operating income as a percent of net sales for the defense businesses had been higher or lower by 1.5 percent in 2003, the Companys operating income would have changed by approximately $250 million. The Company uses lot accounting for new commercial aircraft introductions at Raytheon Aircraft. Lot accounting involves selecting an initial lot size at the time a new aircraft begins to be delivered and measuring an average cost over the entire lot for each aircraft sold. The costs attributed to aircraft delivered are based on the estimated average cost of all aircraft in the lot and are determined under the learning curve concept which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs from cost reduction initiatives and as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition. Once production costs stabilize, which is expected by the time the initial lot has been completed, the use of lot accounting is discontinued. The selection of lot size is a critical judgment. The Company determines lot size based on several factors, including the size of firm backlog, the expected annual production for the aircraft, and experience on similar new aircraft. The size of the initial lot for the Beechcraft Premier I, the only aircraft the Company is currently utilizing lot accounting for, is 200 units. In 2003, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $22 million to reflect the expected loss on the initial lot. A five percent increase in the remaining estimated cost to produce the aircraft would reduce the Companys operating income by approximately $20 million. The valuation of used aircraft in inventories, which are stated at cost, but not in excess of realizable value, requires significant judgment. As part of the assessment of realizable value, the Company must evaluate many factors including current market conditions, future market conditions, the age and condition of the aircraft, and availability levels for the aircraft in the market. A five percent decrease in the aggregate realizable value of used aircraft in inventory at December 31, 2003, would result in an impairment charge of approximately $20 million. The valuation of aircraft materials and parts which support the worldwide fleet of aircraft, which are stated at cost, but not in excess of realizable value, also requires significant judgment. As part of the assessment of realizable value, the Company must evaluate many factors including the expected useful life of the aircraft, some of which have remained in service for up to 50 years. A five percent decrease in the aggregate realizable value of aircraft materials and purchased parts at December 31, 2003, would result in an impairment charge of approximately $15 million. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets upon indication of possible impairment by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the related estimated undiscounted cash flows. When an evaluation indicates that the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets, the asset is adjusted to its estimated fair value. The determination of what constitutes an indication of possible impairment, the estimation of future cash flows, and the determination of estimated fair value are all significant judgments. In addition, the Company performs an annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year. The Company estimates the fair value of reporting units using a discounted cash flow model based on the Companys most recent five year plan and compares the estimated fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. Preparation of forecasts for use in the five year plan involve significant judgments. Changes in these forecasts could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the Companys reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. The Company has pension plans covering the majority of its employees, including certain employees in foreign countries. The selection of the assumptions used to determine pension expense or income involves significant judgment. The Companys long term return on asset (ROA) and discount rate assumptions are considered to be the key variables in determining pension expense or income. To develop the long term ROA assumption, the Company considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the Company has invested pension plan assets, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. Since the Companys investment policy is to employ active management strategies in all asset classes, the potential exists to outperform the broader markets, therefore, the expected returns were adjusted upward. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based on the target asset allocation to develop the long term ROA assumption. The long term ROA assumption is based on target asset allocations of between 65 and 70 percent equities with a 9.75% expected return, between 20 and 25 percent fixed income with a 5.25% expected return, up to 5 percent real estate with an 8.25% expected return, and between 5 and 10 percent other (including private equity and cash) with a 10.5% expected return. The long term ROA assumption for the Companys domestic pension plans in 2004 is 8.75%. The discount rate assumption was determined by using a model consisting of a theoretical bond portfolio that matches the Companys 27 Table of Contents pension liability duration. The discount rate assumption for the Companys domestic pension plans in 2004 is 6.25%. The Companys pension expense is expected to be approximately $700 million in 2004 and $750 million in 2005. For every 2.5 percent that in the actual domestic pension plan asset return exceeds or is less than the long term ROA assumption for 2004, the Companys pension expense for 2004 will change by approximately $15 million. If the Company adjusts the discount rate assumption for 2005 up or down by 25 basis points, the Companys pension expense would change by approximately $40 million. Effective January 1, 2004, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans from October 31 to December 31. This change in measurement date will be accounted for as a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle is anticipated to be a gain of $34 million after tax for pension benefits and a gain of $7 million after tax for other postretirement benefits and will be recognized in 2004. Using the Companys year end as the measurement date for pension and other postretirement benefit plans more appropriately reflects the plans financial status for the years then ended. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net sales were $18.1 billion in 2003, $16.8 billion in 2002, and $16.0 billion in 2001. The increase in sales was due primarily to higher U.S. Department of Defense expenditures in the Companys defense businesses, primarily Integrated Defense Systems, Missile Systems, and Space and Airborne Systems. Sales to the U.S. Department of Defense were 65 percent of sales in 2003, 62 percent in 2002, and 59 percent in 2001. Total sales to the U.S. government, including foreign military sales, were 74 percent of sales in 2003, 73 percent in 2002, and 70 percent in 2001. International sales, including foreign military sales, were 19 percent of sales in 2003, 21 percent in 2002, and 22 percent in 2001. While international sales have remained flat, the amount as a percent of sales has declined as a result of increased sales to the U.S. Department of Defense. Gross margin (net sales less cost of sales) was $3.1 billion in 2003, $3.4 billion in 2002, and $2.4 billion in 2001, or 17.2 percent of sales in 2003, 20.3 percent in 2002, and 14.7 percent in 2001. Included in gross margin was a FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment, described below, of $109 million of expense, $210 million of income, and $386 million of income in 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively. The change in the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment was due primarily to the reduction in the Companys long term return on asset assumption and the actual rate of return on pension plan assets over the last several years. The decrease in gross margin as a percent of sales in 2003 was due, in part, to charges of $237 million at Network Centric Systems and $39 million at Technical Services, described below in Segment Results. Included in gross margin in 2001 was goodwill amortization of $334 million, which was discontinued January 1, 2002 as described below. Excluding goodwill amortization, gross margin was $2.7 billion or 16.8 percent of sales in 2001. Included in gross margin in 2001 were charges of $745 million at Raytheon Aviation Airline Services, described below in Segment Results. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS No. 87), outlines the methodology used to determine pension expense or income for financial reporting purposes, which is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements of pension plans, which are determined by other factors. A major factor for determining pension funding requirements are Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) that proscribe the allocation to and recovery of pension costs on U.S. government contracts. The Company now reports the difference between SFAS No. 87 (FAS) pension expense or income and CAS pension expense as a separate line item in the Companys segment results called FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment. The results for each segment only include pension expense as determined under CAS, which can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. Administrative and selling expenses were $1,306 million or 7.2 percent of sales in 2003, $1,170 million or 7.0 percent of sales in 2002, and $1,131 million or 7.1 percent of sales in 2001. Included in administrative and selling expenses in 2002 was a $29 million gain on the sale of the Companys corporate headquarters. Research and development expenses were $487 million or 2.7 percent of sales in 2003, $449 million or 2.7 percent of sales in 2003, and $456 million or 2.8 percent of sales in 2001. Operating income was $1,316 million or 7.3 percent of sales in 2003, $1,783 million or 10.6 percent of sales in 2002, and $766 million or 4.8 percent of sales in 2001. Excluding goodwill amortization, operating income was $1,100 million or 6.9 percent of sales in 2001. The changes in operating income by segment are described below in Segment Results. Interest expense from continuing operations was $537 million in 2003, $497 million in 2002, and $696 million in 2001. In 2002 and 2001, the Company allocated $79 million and $18 million, respectively, of interest expense to discontinued operations. The Company did not allocate interest expense to discontinued operations in 2003 as described below in Discontinued Operations. Total interest expense was $576 million in 2002 and $714 million in 2001. The decrease in interest expense in 2003 was due to a lower weighted average cost of borrowing. The decrease in 2002 was due to lower average debt and a lower weighted average cost of borrowing due, in part, to the interest rate swaps entered into in 2001, described below in Capital Structure and Resources. The weighted average cost of borrowing was 6.0 percent in 2003, 6.7 percent in 2002, and 7.1 percent in 2001. 28 Table of Contents Interest income was $50 million in 2003, $27 million in 2002, and $36 million in 2001. The increase in interest income was due to interest on long term receivables brought onto the Companys books as part of the buy out of the Aircraft Receivables Facility in the fourth quarter of 2002, described below in Financial Condition and Liquidity. Other expense, net was $67 million in 2003, $237 million in 2002, and $6 million in 2001. Included in other expense, net in 2003 was a $77 million charge related to the Companys repurchase of long term debt, described below in Capital Structure and Resources, and $20 million of equity losses related to Flight Options LLC, offset by an $82 million gain from the sale of the Companys investment in its former aviation support business, both described below in Major Affiliated Entities. Included in other expense, net in 2002 was a $175 million charge to write off the Companys investment in Space Imaging and accrue for a related credit facility guarantee which the Company paid in 2003, described below in Major Affiliated Entities. Other income and expense also includes gains and losses on divestitures and equity losses in unconsolidated subsidiaries, as described in Note S, Other Income and Expense of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The effective tax rate was 29.8 percent in 2003 and 29.7 percent in 2002, reflecting the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent reduced by ESOP dividend deductions, foreign sales corporation tax credits, and research and development tax credits applicable to certain government contracts. The effective tax rate was 98.0 percent in 2001, reflecting the U.S. statutory rate of 35 percent reduced by foreign sales corporation tax credits and research and development tax credits applicable to certain government contracts, increased by non deductible amortization of goodwill. Excluding the effect of goodwill amortization, the effective tax rate was 29.3 percent in 2001. At December 31, 2003, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $1.4 billion that expire in 2020 through 2023. The Company believes it will be able to utilize all of these carryforwards over the next 3 years. Income from continuing operations was $535 million or $1.29 per diluted share on 415.4 million average shares outstanding in 2003, $756 million or $1.85 per diluted share on 408.0 million average shares outstanding in 2002, and $2 million or $0.01 per diluted share on 361.3 million average shares outstanding in 2001. Excluding goodwill amortization, income from continuing operations was $307 million or $0.85 per diluted share in 2001. The increase in average shares outstanding in 2003 was due primarily to benefit plan related activity. The increase in average shares outstanding in 2002 was due primarily to the issuance of 14,375,000 and 31,578,900 shares of common stock in May and October 2001, respectively. The loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, described below in Discontinued Operations, was $170 million or $0.41 per diluted share in 2003, $887 million or $2.17 per diluted share in 2002, and $757 million or $2.10 per diluted share in 2001. Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142). This accounting standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets and requires that goodwill amortization be discontinued and replaced with periodic tests of impairment. In accordance with SFAS No. 142, goodwill amortization was discontinued as of January 1, 2002. In 2002, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $360 million related to its former Aircraft Integration Systems business (AIS) as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. Due to the non deductibility of this goodwill, the Company did not record a tax benefit in connection with this impairment. Also in 2002, the Company completed the transitional review of the other businesses for potential goodwill impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142 and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $185 million pretax or $149 million after tax, which represented all of the goodwill at Raytheon Aircraft, as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. The Company also determined that there was no impairment of goodwill related to any of the defense businesses beyond the $360 million related to AIS. The total goodwill impairment charge in 2002 was $545 million pretax, $509 million after tax, or $1.25 per diluted share. Net income was $365 million or $0.88 per diluted share in 2003 versus a net loss of $640 million or $1.57 per diluted share in 2002 and a net loss of $755 million or $2.09 per diluted share in 2001. Excluding goodwill amortization, the net loss was $422 million or $1.17 per diluted share in 2001. SEGMENT RESULTS Reportable segments have been determined based upon product lines and include the following: Integrated Defense Systems, Intelligence and Information Systems, Missile Systems, Network Centric Systems, Space and Airborne Systems, Technical Services, Aircraft, and Other. In 2003, the Company began reporting its defense businesses in six segments. In addition, the Companys Commercial Electronics businesses were reassigned to the new defense businesses. Also, the Company created an Other segment comprised of Flight Options LLC, Raytheon Airline Aviation Services LLC, and Raytheon Professional Services LLC. Also in 2003, the Company changed the way pension expense or income is reported in the Companys segment results as described above in Consolidated Results of Operations. Information for all periods presented was restated to reflect these changes. 29 Table of Contents Net Sales (In millions) 2003 2002 2001 Integrated Defense Systems $ 2,864 $ 2,366 $ 2,265 Intelligence and Information Systems 2,045 1,887 1,736 Missile Systems 3,538 3,038 2,901 Network Centric Systems 2,809 3,091 2,865 Space and Airborne Systems 3,677 3,243 2,738 Technical Services 1,963 2,133 2,050 Aircraft 2,088 2,040 2,471 Other 573 210 207 Corporate and Eliminations (1,448 ) (1,248 ) (1,216 ) Total $ 18,109 $ 16,760 $ 16,017 Operating Income (In millions) 2003 2002 2001 Integrated Defense Systems $ 331 $ 289 $ 238 Intelligence and Information Systems 194 180 139 Missile Systems 424 373 257 Network Centric Systems 19 278 246 Space and Airborne Systems 492 428 339 Technical Services 107 116 123 Aircraft 2 (39 ) (77 ) Other (34 ) (12 ) (758 ) FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment (109 ) 210 386 Corporate and Eliminations (110 ) (40 ) (127 ) Total $ 1,316 $ 1,783 $ 766 Operating Margin 2003 2002 2001 Integrated Defense Systems 11.6 % 12.2 % 10.5 % Intelligence and Information Systems 9.5 9.5 8.0 Missile Systems 12.0 12.3 8.9 Network Centric Systems 0.7 9.0 8.6 Space and Airborne Systems 13.4 13.2 12.4 Technical Services 5.5 5.4 6.0 Aircraft 0.1 (1.9 ) (3.1 ) Other (5.9 ) (5.7 ) (366.2 ) FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment Corporate and Eliminations Total 7.3 % 10.6 % 4.8 % Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) provides mission systems integration for the air, surface, and subsurface battlespace. IDS had 2003 sales of $2.9 billion versus $2.4 billion in 2002 and $2.3 billion in 2001. The increase in sales in 2003 was due to continued growth on DD(X), the Navys future destroyer program, as well as strong missile defense sales. The increase in sales in 2002 was due to higher missile defense volume. Operating income was $331 million in 2003 versus $289 million in 2002 and $238 million in 2001. Excluding goodwill amortization, operating income was $256 million in 2001 or 11.3 percent of net sales. The decrease in operating margin in 2003 was due to lower volume on higher margin international programs. Intelligence and Information Systems (IIS) provides signal and image processing, geospatial intelligence, airborne and spaceborne command and control, ground engineering support, weather and environmental management, and information technology. IIS had 2003 sales of $2.0 billion versus $1.9 billion in 2002 and $1.7 billion in 2001. The increase in sales in 2003 and 2002 was due to strong growth in classified programs, as well as the start up of the NPOESS (National Polar orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite Systems) program. Operating income was $194 million in 2003 versus $180 million in 2002 and $139 million in 2001. Excluding goodwill amortization, operating income was $179 million in 2001 or 10.3 percent of net sales. Missile Systems (MS) provides air to air, precision strike, surface Navy air defense, and land combat missiles, guided projectiles, kinetic kill vehicles, and directed energy weapons. MS had 2003 sales of $3.5 billion versus $3.0 billion in 2002 and $2.9 billion in 2001. The increase in sales in 2003 was due to the Tomahawk remanufacture program reaching full rate production and several production programs transitioning from engineering development to low rate initial production including Air Intercept Missile (AIM 9X), Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM), and Tactical Tomahawk. Sales also increased on several missile defense programs in order to meet accelerated deployment. The increase in sales in 2002 was due to the ramp up on the Exo Atmospheric Kill Vehicle program and the transition of the ESSM program to full rate production. Operating income was $424 million in 2003 versus $373 million in 2002 and $257 million in 2001. Excluding goodwill amortization, operating income was $356 million in 2001 or 12.3 percent of net sales. Network Centric Systems (NCS) provides network centric solutions to integrate sensors, communications, and command and control to manage the battlespace. NCS had 2003 sales of $2.8 billion versus $3.1 billion in 2002 and $2.9 billion in 2001. Operating income was $19 million in 2003 versus $278 million in 2002 and $246 million in 2001. Excluding goodwill amortization, operating income was $313 million in 2001 or 10.9 percent of net sales. The decrease in sales and operating income in 2003 was due to charges affecting operating income totaling $237 million which also resulted in a $228 million reduction in sales. Performance deterioration in ten programs primarily within the Air Traffic Management Systems business and the Communications business resulted in a charge in the third quarter of 2003 of $147 million. There were a number of unfavorable events that occurred on these ten programs including unsuccessful resolution of technical issues, inability to achieve production rates and milestones, customer directed delays and reductions in scheduled deliveries, and unfavorable rulings and negotiations on contractual matters. In the first six months of 2003, the Company recorded a $50 million charge on two of these programs related to schedule and production delays. In addition to the ten programs, the Company recorded a charge of $40 million in the third quarter of 2003 resulting from negative developments on a few claims and other performance issues in other parts of the business. Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) provides electro optical/ infrared sensors, airborne radars, solid state high energy lasers, precision guidance systems, electronic warfare systems, and 30 Table of Contents space qualified systems for civil and military applications. SAS had 2003 sales of $3.7 billion versus $3.2 billion in 2002 and $2.7 billion in 2001. The increase in sales in 2003 was due to higher sales on classified and Airborne Radar programs for the Air Force such as Multi platform Radar Technology Insertion Program, B 2 Radar Modernization Program, F 15 Korea, and increased production of the F/A 22 Radar. Operating income was $492 million in 2003 versus $428 million in 2002 and $339 million in 2001. Excluding goodwill amortization, operating income was $416 million in 2001 or 15.2 percent of net sales. Technical Services (TS) provides technical, scientific, and professional services for defense, federal, and commercial customers worldwide. TS had 2003 sales of $2.0 billion versus $2.1 billion in 2002 and 2001. The decrease in sales in 2003 was due to the loss of several key programs. Operating income was $107 million in 2003 versus $116 million in 2002 and $123 million in 2001. Excluding goodwill amortization, operating income was $148 million in 2001 or 7.2 percent of net sales. The decrease in operating income in 2003 was primarily due to write offs of $39 million related to an unfavorable change in scope on a long term contract of $22 million and a provision for the collectibility of certain unbilled costs of $17 million. Included in operating income for 2002 was a $28 million write off of contract costs that the Company determined to be unbillable. The decrease was offset by a similarly sized reserve at corporate established by the Company in the second half of 2001 to address the issue. Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) designs, manufactures, markets, and provides after market support for business jets, turbo props, and piston powered aircraft for the worlds commercial, fractional ownership, and military aircraft markets. RAC had 2003 sales of $2.1 billion versus $2.0 billion in 2002 and $2.5 billion in 2001. The decrease in sales in 2002 was due to lower aircraft deliveries, the divestiture of a majority interest in the Companys aviation support business in June 2001, and the divestiture of a majority interest in the Companys aircraft fractional ownership business in March 2002. Operating income was $2 million in 2003 versus an operating loss of $39 million in 2002 and $77 million in 2001. Excluding goodwill amortization, RAC had an operating loss of $69 million in 2001 or (2.8) percent of net sales. The increase in operating income in 2003 was due to higher productivity and cost saving initiatives implemented over the last year. Included in 2003 operating income was a $46 million favorable profit adjustment on the Joint Primary Aircraft Training System (JPATS) program partially offset by a $22 million charge on the Premier program reflecting cost estimate increases. Included in 2002 operating income was a $26 million favorable profit adjustment on the JPATS program. The Company has made a significant investment in its Premier aircraft, the realization of which is contingent upon future sales at forecasted prices and reductions in production costs on future deliveries. The Company continues to monitor the development costs and certification and delivery schedule of the Horizon aircraft with anticipated certification in the third quarter of 2004 and first delivery by year end 2004. The Company continues to believe there is risk in the market outlook for both new and used aircraft. The Other segment, which is comprised of Flight Options LLC (FO), Raytheon Airline Aviation Services LLC (RAAS), and Raytheon Professional Services LLC (RPS) had 2003 sales of $573 million versus $210 million in 2002 and $207 million in 2001. FO offers services in the aircraft fractional ownership industry. RAAS is a unit formed to manage the Companys commuter aircraft business and Starship aircraft portfolio. RPS works with customers to design and execute learning solutions. The increase in sales was due to the consolidation of FO in June 2003 as described below in Major Affiliated Entities. The Other segment had an operating loss of $34 million in 2003 versus $12 million in 2002 and $758 million in 2001. The loss in 2003 included a $32 million operating loss at RAAS due, in part, to an increase in a loan reserve on one major customer. Included in the 2001 results was a charge of $693 million related to the commuter aircraft business. This was a result of continued weakness in the commuter aircraft market and the impact of the events of September 11, 2001 on the commuter airline industry. During the first half of 2001, the Company experienced a significant decrease in the volume of used commuter aircraft sales. An evaluation of commuter aircraft market conditions and the events of September 11, 2001 indicated the market weakness would continue into the foreseeable future. As a result, the Company completed an analysis of the estimated fair value of the various models of commuter aircraft and reduced the book value of commuter aircraft inventory and equipment leased to others accordingly. In addition, the Company adjusted the book value of notes receivable and established a reserve for off balance sheet receivables where there was recourse to the Company based on the Companys estimate of exposures on customer financed assets due to defaults, refinancing, and remarketing of these aircraft. Immediately prior to the charge, the Company had exposure on approximately $1,600 million of commuter related assets consisting of 511 aircraft including financing receivables, inventory, and leases. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Companys exposure on commuter related assets was approximately $650 million consisting of 349 aircraft and approximately $800 million consisting of 433 aircraft, respectively. Commuter aircraft customers are generally thinly capitalized companies that are dependant on the commuter aircraft industry. A downturn in this industry could have a material adverse effect on these customers and the Company. The Company also recorded a $52 million charge related to a fleet of Starship aircraft in 2001. During the first three quarters of 2001, the Company had not sold any of these aircraft and recorded a charge to reduce the value of the aircraft to their estimated fair value. In 2002, the Company bought back the remaining off balance sheet receivables, described below in Financial Condition and Liquidity. In connection with the buyback of the off balance sheet receivables, the Company recorded the long term receivables at estimated fair value, which included an assessment of the value of the underlying aircraft. As a result of this assessment, the Company adjusted the value of certain underlying aircraft, including both 31 Table of Contents commuter and Starship aircraft, some of which were written down to scrap value. There was no net income statement impact as a result of this activity.

In 2003, the Company reduced its reported Aircraft backlog by $834 million related to an order received from Flight Options as a result of Flight Options being consolidated with the Company in the second quarter of 2003 as described below in Major Affiliated Entities. In addition, an Aircraft customer canceled its order for 50 Hawker Horizon aircraft resulting in an $895 million backlog reduction. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In 2000, the Company sold its Raytheon Engineers & Constructors businesses (RE&C) to Washington Group International, Inc. (WGI). In May 2001, WGI filed for bankruptcy protection. As a result of the sale and the WGI bankruptcy, the Company was required to perform various contract and lease obligations in connection with a number of different projects under letters of credit, surety bonds, and guarantees (Support Agreements) that it had provided to project owners and other parties. Among the projects involved were two construction projects, the Mystic Station facility in Everett and the Fore River facility in Weymouth (the Massachusetts Projects). Following WGIs abandonment of these projects in 2001, the Company undertook construction efforts on these projects, subsequently delivered care, custody, and control of these projects to their owners, and, as of December 31, 2003, was continuing to perform work on these projects. On February 23, 2004, the Company closed on a settlement agreement with the project owners and other interested parties. The settlement included, among other things, a payment to the Company of approximately $30 million, the return to the Company of approximately $73 million in letters of credit the Company had provided to the project owners, and a release of various claims related to these projects. In addition, under the settlement, the Company remained responsible for all subcontractor and vendor claims prior to the settlement and the project owners assumed responsibility for all post settlement obligations, including completing the construction of the projects, and all punch list and warranty obligations. The Company believes that the obligations retained on these projects are not material. The Company recorded charges of $176 million in 2003, $796 million in 2002, and $814 million in 2001 related to the Massachusetts Projects. The charges resulted from delays, labor and material cost growth, productivity issues, equipment and subcontractor performance, schedule liquidated damages, inaccurate estimates of field engineered materials, and disputed changes. In addition to the Massachusetts Projects, the Company has or had obligations under Support Agreements on a number of other projects. In several cases, the Company has entered into settlement agreements that resolve the Companys obligations under the related Support Agreements. In connection with a number of other projects on which the Company has obligations under Support Agreements, the Company is continuing to undertake the final stages of work, which includes warranty obligations, commercial closeout, and claims resolution. In 2003, the Company recorded charges of $6 million primarily related to the settlement of warranty claims on one of these projects. In 2002 and 2001, the Company recorded charges of $53 million and $210 million, respectively, for various issues in connection with these projects, including but not limited to, punch list items, start up costs, reliability testing, and turbine related delays. Finally, there are projects with Support Agreements provided by the Company on which WGI is continuing to perform work, which could present risk to the Company if WGI fails to meet its obligations in connection with those projects. In performing its obligations under the remaining Support Agreements, the Company has various risks and exposures, including delays, equipment and subcontractor performance, warranty closeout, various liquidated damages issues, collection of amounts due under contracts, and potential adverse claims resolution under various contracts and leases. In addition, the Companys cost estimates for these obligations are heavily dependent upon third parties, including WGI, and their ability to perform construction 32 Table of Contents management, cost estimating, and other tasks requiring industry expertise that the Company no longer possesses. In 2003, the Company recorded charges of $49 million for legal, management, and other costs related to RE&C versus $38 million in 2002 and $30 million in 2001. In 2002 and 2001, the Company allocated $79 million and $18 million, respectively, of interest expense to RE&C based upon actual cash outflows since the date of disposition. Since the Massachusetts Projects were nearing completion, the Company did not allocate interest expense to RE&C in 2003. In addition, in 2001, the Company recorded a charge of $71 million to write off certain assets and liabilities as a result of the WGI bankruptcy filing. In 2003, 2002, and 2001, the pretax loss from discontinued operations related to RE&C was $231 million, $966 million, and $1,143 million, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations related to RE&C was $513 million in 2003 versus $1,129 million in 2002 and $635 million in 2001. The Company expects its operating cash flow to be negatively affected by approximately $50 million to $75 million in 2004 which includes project completion, legal, and management costs related to RE&C. Further increases to project costs may increase the estimated operating cash outflow for RE&C in 2004. In 2002, the Company sold its Aircraft Integration Systems business (AIS) for $1,123 million, net, subject to purchase price adjustments. The Company is currently involved in a purchase price dispute related to the sale of AIS. There was no pretax gain or loss on the sale of AIS, however, due to the non deductible goodwill associated with AIS, the Company recorded a tax provision of $212 million, resulting in a $212 million after tax loss on the sale of AIS. As part of the transaction, the Company retained the responsibility for performance of the Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) program. The Company also retained $106 million of BBJ related assets, $18 million of receivables and other assets, and rights to a $25 million jury award related to a 1999 claim against Learjet. At December 31, 2003, the balance of these retained assets was $45 million. In 2003, the Company recorded charges related to AIS of $17 million related to cost growth on the BBJ program and $13 million as a result of continued difficulty the Company has been experiencing liquidating the BBJ related assets. In 2002, the Company recorded charges of $66 million, which included a $23 million write down of a BBJ related aircraft owned by the Company, a $28 million charge for cost growth on one of the two BBJ aircraft not yet delivered, and a $10 million charge to write down other BBJ related assets to the then estimated net realizable value, offset by a $13 million gain resulting from the finalization of the 1999 claim, described above. The write down of the BBJ related aircraft resulted from the Companys decision to market this aircraft unfinished due to the environment of declining prices for BBJ related aircraft at the time. The Company was previously marketing this aircraft as a customized executive BBJ. In 2003 and 2002, the pretax loss from discontinued operations related to AIS was $30 million and $47 million, respectively. In 2001, pretax income from discontinued operations related to AIS was $5 million. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Net cash provided by operating activities in 2003 was $1,569 million versus $1,039 million in 2002 and $155 million in 2001. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $2,102 million in 2003 versus $2,235 million in 2002 and $751 million in 2001. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations from 2001 was due to better working capital management at the defense businesses, better inventory management at Raytheon Aircraft, a $156 million tax refund received in 2002 as a result of the Job Creation and Worker Assistance Act of 2002, and $95 million received from the close out of certain interest rate swaps, described below in Capital Structure and Resources. Although the Company will continue to focus on working capital management at the defense businesses, this level of improvement is not expected to continue into the foreseeable future. As the Company continues to convert portions of existing financial systems to a new integrated financial package, certain planned delays in billings to customers may occur during 2004, however, the Company does not expect these delays to negatively impact full year cash flow results. Savings and investment plan activity includes certain items related to Companys 401(k) plan that were funded through the issuance of the Companys common stock and are non cash operating activities included on the statement of cash flows. In 2004, these items may be funded by the issuance of the Companys common stock or through purchases of the Companys common stock on the open market. Net cash used in investing activities was $243 million in 2003 versus $719 million in 2002 and $47 million in 2001. The Company provides long term financing to its aircraft customers. Origination of financing receivables was $402 million in 2003, $431 million in 2002, and $663 million in 2001. In 2003, the Company received proceeds of $279 million related to the sale of certain general aviation finance receivables, described below in Off Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements. The Company also maintained a program under which it sold general aviation and commuter aircraft long term receivables under a receivables purchase facility through the end of 2002. Sale of financing receivables was $263 million in 2002 and $696 million in 2001. The Company bought out the receivables that remained in the facility in 2002 for $1,029 million, brought the related assets onto the Companys books, and eliminated the associated $1.4 billion receivables purchase 33 Table of Contents facility. Repurchase of financing receivables was $347 million in 2002 and $329 million in 2001. Capital expenditures were $428 million in 2003, $458 million in 2002, and $461 million in 2001. Capital expenditures in 2004 are expected to approximate $475 million. In 1998, the Company entered into a $490 million property sale and five year operating lease (synthetic lease) facility under which property, plant, and equipment was sold and leased back to the Company. In 2003, the lease facility expired and the Company bought back the assets remaining in the lease facility for $125 million. Proceeds from sales of property, plant, and equipment were $25 million in 2003, $11 million in 2002, and $9 million in 2001. Capitalized expenditures for internal use software were $98 million in 2003, $138 million in 2002, and $149 million in 2001. Capitalized expenditures for internal use software in 2004 are expected to approximate $160 million. In 2003, the Company paid $130 million related to the Space Imaging credit facility guarantee, described below in Major Affiliated Entities. Proceeds from the sale of operating units and investments were $111 million in 2003 versus $1,166 million in 2002 and $266 million in 2001. In 2003, the Company sold the remaining interest in its former aviation support business for $97 million and other investments for $14 million. In 2002, the Company sold its AIS business for $1,123 million, described above in Discontinued Operations, and an investment for $43 million, described below in Major Affiliated Entities. In 2001, the Company sold a majority interest in its aviation support business for $154 million, its recreational marine business for $100 million, and other investments for $12 million. Total sales and operating income related to the businesses divested in 2001 were $248 million and $13 million, respectively, in 2001. Payments for purchases of acquired companies, net of cash received, were $60 million in 2003 versus $10 million in 2002. There were no acquisitions in 2001. In October 2001, the Company and Hughes Electronics agreed to a settlement regarding the purchase price adjustment related to the Companys merger with the defense business of Hughes Electronics Corporation (Hughes Defense). Under the terms of the agreement, Hughes Electronics agreed to reimburse the Company approximately $635 million of its purchase price, with $500 million received in 2001 and the balance received in 2002. The settlement resulted in a $555 million reduction in goodwill. Net cash used in financing activities was $1,209 million in 2003 versus $990 million in 2002. Net cash provided by financing activities was $235 million in 2001. Dividends paid to stockholders were $331 million in 2003, $321 million in 2002, and $281 million in 2001. The quarterly dividend rate was $0.20 per share for each of the four quarters of 2003, 2002, and 2001. CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND RESOURCES Total debt was $7.4 billion at December 31, 2003 and $8.3 billion at December 31, 2002. Cash and cash equivalents were $661 million at December 31, 2003 and $544 million at December 31, 2002. The Companys outstanding debt has interest rates ranging from 1.6% to 8.3% and matures at various dates through 2028. Total debt as a percentage of total capital was 44.7 percent and 48.3 percent at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. In 2003, the Company issued $425 million of long term debt and used the proceeds to reduce the amounts outstanding under the Companys lines of credit. Also in 2003, the Company issued $500 million of fixed rate long term debt and $200 million of floating rate notes and used the proceeds to partially fund the repurchase of long term debt with a par value of $924 million. The Company has on file a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission registering the issuance of up to $3.0 billion in debt securities, common or preferred stock, warrants to purchase any of the aforementioned securities, and or stock purchase contracts, under which $1.3 billion remained outstanding at December 31, 2003. In December 2003, the Company entered into various interest rate swaps that correspond to a portion of the Companys fixed rate debt in order to effectively hedge interest rate risk. The $250 million notional value of the interest rate swaps effectively converted a portion of the Companys total debt to variable rate debt. In 2002, the Company issued $575 million of long term debt to reduce the amounts outstanding under the Companys lines of credit. Also in 2002, the Company repurchased debt with a par value of $96 million. In 2001, the Company entered into various interest rate swaps that corresponded to a portion of the Companys fixed rate debt in order to effectively hedge interest rate risk. In 2002, the Company closed out these interest rate swaps and received proceeds of $95 million which are being amortized over the remaining life of the debt as a reduction to interest expense. At December 31, 2003, the unamortized balance was $45 million. Also in 2001, the Company repurchased long term debt with a par value of $1,375 million. The Companys most restrictive bank agreement covenant is an interest coverage ratio that currently requires earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), excluding certain charges, to be at least 2.5 times net interest expense for the prior four quarters. In July 2003, the covenant was amended to exclude pretax charges of $100 million related to RE&C and in October 2003, the covenant was further amended to exclude $226 million of pretax charges related to Network Centric Systems and Technical Services and $78 million of pretax charges related to RE&C. In July 2002, the covenant was amended to exclude charges of $450 million related to discontinued operations. In the third quarter of 2004, the interest coverage ratio will require EBITDA to be at least 3.0 times net interest expense for the prior four quarters. The Company was in compliance with the interest 34 Table of Contents coverage ratio covenant, as amended, during 2003 and expects to continue to be in compliance throughout 2004. Credit ratings for the Company were assigned by Fitchs at F3 for short term borrowing and BBB for senior debt, by Moodys at P 3 for short term borrowing and Baa3 for senior debt, and by Standard and Poors at A 3 for short term borrowing and BBB for senior debt. Lines of credit with certain commercial banks exist to provide short term liquidity. The lines of credit bear interest based upon LIBOR and were $2.7 billion at December 31, 2003, consisting of $1.4 billion which matures in November 2004 and $1.3 billion which matures in 2006. The lines of credit were $2.85 billion at December 31, 2002. There were no borrowings under the lines of credit at December 31, 2003, however, the Company had approximately $300 million of outstanding letters of credit which effectively reduced the Companys borrowing capacity under the lines of credit to $2.4 billion. There were no borrowings under the lines of credit at December 31, 2002. Credit lines with banks are also maintained by certain foreign subsidiaries to provide them with a limited amount of short term liquidity. These lines of credit were $99 million and $79 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. There was $1 million outstanding under these lines of credit at December 31, 2003 and 2002. In May 2001, the Company issued 17,250,000, 8.25% equity security units for $50 per unit totaling $837 million, net of offering costs of $26 million. The net proceeds of the offering were used to reduce debt and for general corporate purposes. Each equity security unit consists of a contract to purchase shares of the Companys common stock on May 15, 2004, which will result in cash proceeds to the Company of $863 million, and a mandatorily redeemable equity security, with a stated liquidation amount of $50 due on May 15, 2006, which will require a cash payment by the Company of $863 million. The contract obligates the holder to purchase, for $50, shares of common stock equal to the settlement rate. The settlement rate is equal to $50 divided by the average market value of the Companys common stock at that time. The settlement rate cannot be greater than 1.8182 or less than 1.4903 shares of common stock per purchase contract. The terms of the equity security units required that the mandatorily redeemable equity securities be remarketed. On February 11, 2004, the mandatorily redeemable equity securities were remarketed and the quarterly distribution rate was reset at 7%. The Company did not receive any proceeds from the remarketing. The proceeds were pledged to collateralize the holders obligations under the contract to purchase the Companys common stock on May 15, 2004. In May 2001, the Company issued 14,375,000 shares of common stock for $27.50 per share. In October 2001, the Company issued 31,578,900 shares of common stock for $33.25 per share. The proceeds of the offerings were $1,388 million, net of $56 million of offering costs, and were used to reduce debt and for general corporate purposes. The Companys need for, cost of, and access to funds are dependent on future operating results, as well as conditions external to the Company. Cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, proceeds from divestitures, and other available financing resources are expected to be sufficient to meet anticipated operating, capital expenditure, and debt service requirements during the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future. OFF BALANCE SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS In 2003, the Company sold $337 million of general aviation finance receivables to a qualifying special purpose entity which in turn issued beneficial interests in these receivables to a commercial paper conduit, received proceeds of $279 million, retained a subordinated interest in and servicing rights to the receivables, and recognized a gain of $2 million. The sale was non recourse to the Company, and effectively reduced the Companys exposure to general aviation market risk for receivables by approximately 25 percent. MAJOR AFFILIATED ENTITIES In 2002, the Company formed a joint venture, Flight Options LLC (FO), whereby the Company contributed its Raytheon Travel Air fractional ownership business and loaned the new entity $20 million. In June 2003, the Company participated in a financial recapi talization of FO. As a result of this recapitalization, the Company now owns approximately 66 percent of FO and is consolidating FOs results in its financial statements. Prior to the financial recapitalization, 100 percent of FOs $20 million of losses were recorded in other expense in the first six months of 2003 since the Company had been meeting all of FOs financing requirements. The consolidation of FO did not have a significant effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations, although the Companys reported revenue, operating income, and other expense changed as a result of the consolidation of FOs results. FOs customers, in certain instances, have the contractual ability to require FO to buy back their fractional share based on its current fair market value. The estimated value of this potential obligation was approximately $575 million at December 31, 2003. In 1995, through the acquisition of E Systems, Inc., the Company invested in Space Imaging and currently has a 31 percent equity investment in Space Imaging LLC. In 2002, the Company recorded a $175 million charge to write off the Companys investment in Space Imaging and accrue for payment under the Companys guarantee of a Space Imaging credit facility that matured in March 2003. In the first quarter of 2003, the Company paid $130 million related to the credit facility guarantee. In exchange for this payment, the Company received a note from Space Imaging for this amount that the Company has valued at zero. 35 Table of Contents Investments, which are included in other assets, consisted of the following at December 31: (In millions) 2003Ownership % 2003 2002 Equity method investments: Thales Raytheon Systems Co.

The Company had sold a majority interest in Raytheon Aerospace in 2001 for $154 million in cash and retained $47 million in trade receivables and $66 million in preferred and common equity in the business. The $66 million represented a 26 percent ownership interest and was recorded at zero because the new entity was highly leveraged. In 2003, the Company sold its investment in Alliance Laundry Systems for $15 million and recorded a loss of $4 million. The Company had sold its commercial laundry business unit to Alliance in 1998 for $315 million in cash and $19 million in securities. In 2001, the Company formed a joint venture, Thales Raytheon Systems (TRS), that has two major operating subsidiaries, one of which the Company controls and consolidates. TRS is a system of systems integrator and provides fully customized solutions through the integration of command and control centers, radars, and communication networks. HRL Laboratories is a scientific research facility whose staff engages in the areas of space and defense technologies. Indra develops flight data processors for air traffic control automation systems. TelASIC Communications delivers high performance, cost effective radio frequency (RF), analog mixed signal, and digital solutions for both the commercial and defense electronics markets. Hughes Arabia Limited was formed in connection with the award of the Peace Shield program and offers certain tax advantages to the Company. In addition, the Company has entered into joint ventures formed specifically to facilitate a teaming arrangement between two contractors for the benefit of the customer, generally the U.S. government, whereby the Company receives a subcontract from the joint venture in the joint ventures capacity as prime contractor. Accordingly, the Company records the work it performs for the joint venture as operating activity. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES Defense contractors are subject to many levels of audit and investigation. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Department of Defense Inspector General, the General Accounting Office, the Department of Justice, and Congressional Committees. The Department of Justice, from time to time, has convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by the Company. Except as noted in the following paragraphs, individually and in the aggregate, these investigations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In 2002, the Company received service of a grand jury subpoena issued by the United States District Court for the Central District of California. The subpoena seeks documents related to the activities of an international sales representative engaged by the Company related to a foreign military sales contract in Korea in the late 1990s. The Company has cooperated fully in the investigation including producing documents in response to the subpoena. The Company has in place appropriate compliance policies and procedures, and believes its conduct has been consistent with those policies and procedures. The Company continues to cooperate with the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on a formal investigation related to the Companys accounting practices primarily related to the commuter aircraft business and the timing of revenue recognition at Raytheon Aircraft. The Company has been providing documents and information to the SEC staff. In addition, certain present and former officers and employees of the Company have provided testimony in connection with this investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigation or any action that the SEC might take. In late 1999, the Company and two of its officers were named as defendants in several class action lawsuits which were consolidated into a single complaint in June 2000, when four additional former or present officers were named as defendants (the Consolidated Complaint). The Consolidated Complaint principally alleges that the defendants violated federal securities laws by making misleading statements and by failing to disclose material information concerning the Companys financial performance during the purported class period. In March 2000, the court certified the class of plaintiffs as those people who purchased the Companys stock between October 7, 1998 and October 12, 1999. In August 2001, the court issued an order dismissing most of the claims asserted against the Company and the individual defendants. In March 2003, the plaintiff filed an amendment to the Consolidated Complaint which sought to add the Companys independent auditor as an additional defendant. In May 2003, the court issued an order dismissing one of the two claims that had been asserted against the Companys independent auditor. In February 2004, the Company and the individual defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, which the plaintiff opposes. A hearing on the summary judgment motion is scheduled for April 2004. The Court has scheduled a trial to begin in May 2004. The Companys independent auditor has also filed a motion for summary judgment which the plaintiff opposes. In 1999 and 2000, the Company was named as a nominal defendant and all of its directors at the time (except one) were named as defendants in purported derivative lawsuits. The derivative 36 Table of Contents complaints contain allegations similar to those included in the Consolidated Complaint and further allege that the defendants breached fiduciary duties to the Company and allegedly failed to exercise due care and diligence in the management and administration of the affairs of the Company. In December 2001, the Company and the individual defendants filed a motion to dismiss one of the derivative lawsuits. These actions have since been consolidated, and the plaintiffs have filed a consolidated amended complaint. In April 2003, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the consolidated amended complaint. In June 2001, a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of all purchasers of common stock or senior notes of WGI during the class period of April 17, 2000 through March 1, 2001 (the WGI Complaint). The plaintiff class claims to have suffered harm by purchasing WGI securities because the Company and certain of its officers allegedly violated federal securities laws by misrepresenting the true financial condition of RE&C in order to sell RE&C to WGI at an artificially inflated price. An amended complaint was filed in October 2001 alleging similar claims. The Company and the individual defendants filed a motion seeking to dismiss the action in November 2001. In April 2002, the motion to dismiss was denied. The defendants have filed their answer to the amended complaint and discovery is proceeding. In April 2003, the District Court conditionally certified the class and defined the class period as that between April 17, 2000 and March 2, 2001, inclusive. The defendants have filed their answer to the amended complaint and discovery is proceeding. In July 2001, the Company was named as a nominal defendant and all of its directors at the time have been named as defendants in two identical purported derivative lawsuits. These lawsuits were consolidated into one action (the Consolidated Amended Derivative Complaint) in January 2004 and contain allegations similar to those included in the WGI Complaint and further allege that the individual defendants breached fiduciary duties to the Company and failed to maintain systems necessary for prudent management and control of the Companys operations. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Derivative Complaint in March 2004. Also in July 2001, the Company was named as a nominal defendant and members of its Board of Directors and several current and former officers have been named as defendants in another purported shareholder derivative action, which contains allegations similar to those included in the WGI Complaint and further alleges that the individual defendants breached fiduciary duties to the Company and failed to maintain systems necessary for prudent management and control of the Companys operations. In June 2002, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint. In September 2002, the plaintiff agreed to voluntarily dismiss this action without prejudice so that it can be re filed in another jurisdiction. In May 2003, two purported class action lawsuits were filed on behalf of participants in the Companys savings and investment plans who invested in the Companys stock between August 19, 1999 and May 27, 2003. The two class action complaints are brought pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Both lawsuits are substantially similar and have been consolidated into a single action. The complaints allege that the Company and certain members of the Companys Investment Committee breached ERISA fiduciary and co fiduciary duties by allegedly failing to (1) disseminate necessary information regarding the savings and investment plans investment in the Companys stock, (2) diversify the savings and investment plans assets away from the Companys stock, (3) monitor investment alternatives to the Companys stock, and (4) avoid conflicts of interest. Although the Company believes that it and the other defendants have meritorious defenses to each and all of the aforementioned class action and derivative complaints and intends to contest each lawsuit vigorously, an adverse resolution of any of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations. The Company is not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses, if any, related to any of the lawsuits. In addition, various claims and legal proceedings generally incidental to the normal course of business are pending or threatened against the Company. While the ultimate liability from these proceedings is presently indeterminable, any additional liability is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. The Company is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to remediation of various environmental sites. The Companys estimate of total environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred is $119 million. Discounted at 8.5 percent, the Company estimates the liability to be $72 million before U.S. government recovery and had this amount accrued at December 31, 2003. A portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. The recovery of environmental cleanup costs from the U.S. government is considered probable based on the Companys long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs. Accordingly, the Company has recorded $47 million at December 31, 2003 for the estimated future recovery of these costs from the U.S. government, which is included in contracts in process. The Company leases certain government owned properties and is generally not liable for environmental remediation at these sites, therefore, no provision has been made in the financial statements for these costs. Due to the complexity of environmental laws and regulations, the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup methods and technologies, the uncertainty of insurance coverage, and the unresolved extent of the Companys responsibility, it is difficult to determine the ultimate outcome of these matters, however, any additional liability is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. The Company issues guarantees and has banks and surety companies issue, on its behalf, letters of credit and surety bonds to meet various bid, performance, warranty, retention, and advance payment obligations. Approximately $1,316 million, $890 million, 37 Table of Contents and $389 million of these guarantees, letters of credit, and surety bonds, for which there were stated values, were outstanding at December 31, 2003, respectively and $1,614 million, $1,227 million, and $458 million were outstanding at December 31, 2002, respectively. These instruments expire on various dates through 2007. At December 31, 2003, the amount of guarantees, letters of credit, and surety bonds, for which there were stated values, that remained outstanding was $90 million, $146 million, and $283 million, respectively, related to discontinued operations and are included in the numbers above. Additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no stated value also remain outstanding. In 1997, the Company provided a first loss guarantee of $133 million on $1.3 billion of U.S. Export Import Bank debt through 2015 related to the Brazilian governments System for the Vigilance of the Amazon (SIVAM) program. The following is a schedule of the Companys contractual obligations outstanding (excluding working capital items) at December 31, 2003: (In millions) Total Less than1 Year 13years 45years After 5years Debt $ 6,564 $ 15 $ 1,208 $ 1,709 $ 3,632 Subordinated notes payable 863 863 Interest payments 7,031 395 740 592 5,304 Operating leases 1,477 294 507 349 327 IT outsourcing 392 68 131 128 65 Equity security unit distributions 156 65 91 Pension contributions 635 320 315 Total $ 17,118 $ 1,157 $ 3,855 $ 2,778 $ 9,328 Interest payments include interest on debt that is redeemable at the option of the Company. The Company currently estimates that pension plan cash contributions will be approximately $320 million in 2004 and $315 million in 2005. These estimates are based upon certain assumptions, outlined above in Critical Accounting Policies, and contemplate passage of the Pension Funding Equity Act, which will provide a certain amount of pension funding relief to the Company. The estimate for 2005 is subject to change and will not be known with certainty until the Companys SFAS No. 87 assumptions are updated at the end of 2004. Estimates for 2006 and beyond have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts, which are subject to change until the Companys SFAS No. 87 assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times. In addition, pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government, therefore, the amounts noted above are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions will have on the Companys liquidity. At December 31, 2003, RAC had unconditional purchase obligations of $29 million primarily related to component parts for the Horizon aircraft with varying purchase quantities for up to 200 aircraft. In addition, the Companys defense businesses may enter into purchase commitments which can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. These unconditional purchase obligations are not included in the table above. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46). FIN 46 addresses the consolidation of certain variable interest entities (VIEs) and may be applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment or by restating previously issued financial statements with a cumulative effect adjustment as of the beginning of the first year restated. In December 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (revised December 2003), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46R). FIN 46R significantly narrowed the original scope of FIN 46 by excluding entities possessing certain characteristics, among other things. FIN 46R deferred the effective date of FIN 46 for interests held in VIEs created before February 1, 2003, except for special purpose entities as defined by FIN 46R, until the end of the first interim period ending after March 15, 2004. The adoption of FIN 46R is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In December 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 132 (revised 2003), Employers Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits, an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, and 106. Information about foreign plans is required by this accounting standard for fiscal years ending after June 15, 2004, including additional disclosures about assets, obligations, cash flows, and net periodic benefit cost of defined benefit pension plans and other defined benefit postretirement plans. 38 Table of Contents Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys primary market exposures are to interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company meets its working capital requirements with a combination of variable rate short term and fixed rate long term financing. The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements with commercial and investment banks primarily to manage interest rates associated with the Companys financing arrangements. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts with commercial banks only to fix the dollar value of specific commitments and payments to international vendors and the value of foreign currency denominated receipts. The market risk sensitive instruments used by the Company for hedging are entered into with commercial and investment banks and are directly related to a particular asset, liability, or transaction for which a firm commitment is in place. The Company has used a special purpose entity to sell aircraft receivables and retains a partial interest that includes servicing rights, interest only strips, and subordinated certificates. Financial instruments held by the Company which are subject to interest rate risk include notes payable, long term debt, long term receivables, investments, and interest rate swap agreements. The aggregate hypothetical loss in earnings for one year of those financial instruments held by the Company at December 31, 2003 and 2002, which are subject to interest rate risk resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 10 percent, was less than $1 million after tax for both years. Fixed rate financial instruments were not evaluated, as the risk exposure is not material. 39 Table of Contents
