Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Raytheon Company (the Company) is one of the largest defense electronics contractors in the world, serving all branches of the U.S. military and other U.S. government agencies, NATO, and many allied governments. The Company is a leader in its core defense markets: radars and radio frequency systems; sensors and electro optics; precision weapons; and command, control, communications, and information systems. In all of these markets, the Company provides full life cycle services to its customers, including product design, delivery, and support. Raytheon Aircraft is a leading provider of business and special mission aircraft and delivers a broad line of jet, turboprop, and piston powered airplanes to individual, corporate, and government customers worldwide. DEFENSE INDUSTRY CONSIDERATIONS The global War on Terrorism, Operation Enduring Freedom, and Operation Iraqi Freedom, have altered the defense and security environment of the United States. These events have had, and for the foreseeable future are likely to continue to have, a significant impact on the markets for defense and advanced technology systems and products. The U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) continues to focus on both supporting ongoing operations and transforming our military to confront future threats. Our customers plan to operate in a new paradigm. They define an approach that emphasizes speed, precision, and flexibility; and by sharing superior knowledge, enables forces to seize and sustain initiative, concentrate combat power, and prevent an enemy response. In this new environment, the need for advanced technology and defense electronics is clear. The recent growth in military expenditures is driven by the multi pronged approach required to fight the War on Terrorism, replenish war materials consumed during continued operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, and sustain the momentum in pursuit of transformation. The Company is an active participant in all three efforts. Much of the Companys business is with the DoD, and the Companys future growth prospects are sensitive to changes in the DoD budget. In particular, the DoD Research, Development, Test and Evaluation (RDT&E) budget and the DoD Procurement budget, collectively known as the investment accounts, are a key source of funding for the Companys programs. The Future Years Defense Program included in the Presidents FY06 budget submission to Congress shows continued projected growth in the investment accounts through FY11, with some shift from RDT&E to Procurement in the later years. The FY05 supplemental request submitted to Congress, while primarily targeted to supporting ongoing operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, also includes proposed additional investment account funding. The Companys strategy is designed to capitalize on the breadth and depth of the Companys technology and domain expertise in order to meet the evolving needs of the Companys customers. The Company is focusing on the following Strategic Business Areas, which are aligned with the ongoing military operations and Department of Defense transformation goals and the goals of the Department of Homeland Security: Missile Defense Precision Engagement Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Homeland Security Missile Defense The Company is working with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and other companies to develop and test a layered system that will detect, identify, and intercept missiles in all phases of flight the boost, midcourse, and terminal phases. The fundamental components of integrated missile defense are sensors, interceptors, command and control, and systems integration. The Company is a technology leader in all of these Table of Contents 34 areas. The Company is committed to helping the U.S. Missile Defense Agency to develop an operational Ballistic Missile Defense System. The Companys broad array of solutions provides the capability to detect and respond to threats at all three phases of the missile defense system. The Companys programs addressing all three phases include Ballistic Missile Defense System Radar, Space Tracking and Surveillance System, and Cobra Judy Radar. The Kinetic Energy Interceptor addresses the boost phase. The Companys programs addressing the midcourse phase include Upgraded Early Warning Radars, Exo Atmospheric Kill Vehicle, Sea Based X Band Radar, and Standard Missile 3. Those addressing the terminal phase threat include the Patriot Air and Missile Defense System, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) Battle Management Command Control and Communication, and THAAD Ground Based Radar. Precision Engagement The Company provides mission solutions across the entire precision engagement chain. The Companys customers are increasingly looking for mission solutions that address the need to operate jointly (across services and between allied forces), work in a new net centric paradigm, minimize collateral damage, and strike time sensitive targets. The Companys precision engagement systems include: F 15 and F/A 18 Active Electronically Scanned Array radars, Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile, Miniature Air Launched Decoy, Situation Awareness Data Link, UK Joint Effects Tactical Targeting System, NetFires, Joint Standoff Weapon, Paveway, Tactical Tomahawk, F/A 18 Radar Warning Receiver, High Power Microwave, and High Energy Lasers. Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance The Companys sensing, processing, and dissemination technologies effectively compress the information gap from hours to minutes. The Company provides integrated systems solutions for observing, locating, processing, deciding, and disseminating actionable information, enabling network centric operations for decision makers. These abilities are crucial for war fighters to achieve information dominance throughout the entire battlespace. The Companys key ISR programs include: Global Hawk sensor suite, Distributed Common Ground System, Space Based Radar, National Polar orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite Systems, Future Combat Systems Ground Sensor Integrator, and numerous classified programs. Homeland Security In the area of Homeland Security, the Company continues to leverage the technologies and solutions it has developed for its traditional defense markets to provide solutions to homeland security customers. Recent efforts have focused on the exploitation of the Companys expertise in the collection and analysis of large amounts of data. This has led to wins in border security, most notably US VISIT, and in related areas. The Company provides electronics for a wide range of missions and platforms and has several thousand active programs with U.S. government and other customers. The Company believes that this diversification reduces some of the risk and volatility often inherent in the defense industry. The Company generally acts as a prime contractor or subcontractor on its programs. The funding of U.S. government programs is subject to Congressional authorization and appropriation. While Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis, major defense programs are usually conducted under binding contracts over multiple years. The termination of funding for a U.S. government program could result in a loss of future revenues, which would have a negative effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations. U.S. government contracts are also subject to oversight audits and contain provisions for termination. Failure to comply with U.S. government regulations could lead to suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting. Sales to the U.S. government may be affected by changes in procurement policies, budget considerations, changing defense requirements, and political developments. The influence of these factors, which are largely beyond the Companys control, could impact the Companys financial position or results of operations. Table of Contents 35 AIRCRAFT INDUSTRY CONSIDERATIONS As the economy has been recovering, indicated by several measures including gross domestic product, corporate profits, and personal disposable income, the general aviation market has been recovering as well. Although still below its peak performance in 2001, 2004 reflected an improvement compared to the depressed level of activity experienced in 2002 and 2003. Traditionally, the used aircraft market has led the recovery of the new aircraft market by 9 12 months and although worldwide levels of used aircraft available for sale have declined, a slower or delayed economic recovery could delay market demand for used, and ultimately new aircraft. The decline in the worldwide fleet of used aircraft available for sale has resulted in improved pricing of new aircraft and many manufacturers have increased line or production rates. In order to support a continued recovery of the new aircraft market, however, the current worldwide inventory of used aircraft must be reduced even further. Due to the lower levels of used inventory and strong third and fourth quarter 2004 sales activity for new aircraft, the industry consensus is that the market for new aircraft will continue to improve in 2005 and into the foreseeable future. It is unknown at this time what impact, if any, will be felt without the benefit of bonus depreciation from the Jobs Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003, which expired in 2004. FINANCIAL SUMMARY As discussed in more detail throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: Gross bookings were $25.7 billion in 2004, $22.7 billion in 2003, and $17.9 billion in 2002, resulting in backlog of $32.5 billion, $27.5 billion, and $25.7 billion at December 31, 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Backlog represents future sales expected to be recognized over the next several years. Net sales were $20.2 billion in 2004, $18.1 billion in 2003, and $16.8 billion in 2002. The increase in sales was a result of strong growth at the defense businesses, primarily Integrated Defense Systems and Space and Airborne Systems as well as growth at Raytheon Aircraft. Operating income was $1.4 billion in 2004, $1.3 billion in 2003, and $1.8 billion in 2002. Operating income as a percent of net sales was 6.9 percent, 7.3 percent, and 10.6 percent in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. Included in operating income was a FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment, described below in Consolidated Results of Operations, of $474 million of expense in 2004, $109 million of expense in 2003, and $210 million of income in 2002. The FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment in 2005 is expected to approximate the 2004 amount. Also included in operating income in 2003 were charges on certain programs at Network Centric Systems and Technical Services of $276 million. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $2.1 billion in 2004, $2.6 billion in 2003, and $0.8 billion in 2002. Total debt was $5.2 billion at December 31, 2004 versus $7.4 billion at December 31, 2003. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Company has identified the following accounting policies that require significant judgment. The Company believes its judgments related to these accounting policies are appropriate. Sales under long term government contracts are recorded under the percentage of completion method. Incurred costs and estimated gross margins are recorded as sales when work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to the Companys estimates of total costs and contract value. Cost estimates include direct and indirect costs such as labor, materials, warranty, and overhead. Some contracts contain incentive provisions based upon performance in relation to established targets which are included at estimated realizable value. Contract change orders and claims are included when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable. Due to the long term nature of many of the Companys programs, developing estimates of total costs and contract value often requires significant judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be Table of Contents 36 performed, the impact of change orders, availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, award fee estimations, and the recoverability of claims. In 2004, 2003, and 2002, operating income as a percent of net sales for the defense businesses did not vary by more than 1.6 percent. If operating income as a percent of net sales for the defense businesses had been higher or lower by 1.6 percent in 2004, the Companys operating income would have changed by approximately $300 million. The Company uses lot accounting for new commercial aircraft introductions at Raytheon Aircraft. Lot accounting involves selecting an initial lot size at the time a new aircraft begins to be delivered and measuring an average cost over the entire lot for each aircraft sold. The costs attributed to aircraft delivered are based on the estimated average cost of all aircraft in the lot and are determined under the learning curve concept which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs from cost reduction initiatives and as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition. Once the initial lot has been completed, the use of lot accounting is discontinued. The selection of lot size is a critical judgment. The Company determines lot size based on several factors, including the size of firm backlog, market and competitive conditions, the expected annual production for the aircraft, and experience on similar new aircraft. The size of the initial lot for the Beechcraft Premier I is 200 units. The size of the initial lot for the Hawker Horizon is 75 units. A five percent increase in the remaining estimated costs to produce the initial lots of these two aircraft would reduce the Companys operating income by approximately $75 million in the aggregate. The valuation of used aircraft in inventories, which are stated at cost, but not in excess of realizable value, requires significant judgment. As part of the assessment of realizable value, the Company must evaluate many factors including current market conditions, future market conditions, the age and condition of the aircraft, and availability levels for the aircraft in the market. A five percent decrease in the aggregate realizable value of used aircraft in inventory at December 31, 2004, would result in an impairment charge of approximately $15 million. The valuation of aircraft materials and parts that support the worldwide fleet of aircraft, which are stated at cost, but not in excess of realizable value, also requires significant judgment. As part of the assessment of realizable value, the Company must evaluate many factors including the expected useful life of the aircraft, some of which have remained in service for up to 50 years. A five percent decrease in the aggregate realizable value of aircraft materials and parts at December 31, 2004, would result in an impairment charge of approximately $10 million. The Company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets upon indication of possible impairment by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the related estimated undiscounted cash flows. When an evaluation indicates that the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets, the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value. The determination of what constitutes an indication of possible impairment, the estimation of future cash flows, and the determination of estimated fair value are all significant judgments. In addition, the Company performs an annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year. The Company estimates the fair value of reporting units using a discounted cash flow model based on the Companys most recent five year plan and compares the estimated fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. Preparation of forecasts for use in the five year plan involve significant judgments. Changes in these forecasts could affect the estimated fair value of certain of the Companys reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period, however, a 10 percent decrease in the current fair value of each of the Companys reporting units would not result in a goodwill impairment charge. The Company has pension plans covering the majority of its employees, including certain employees in foreign countries. The selection of the assumptions used to determine pension expense or income involves significant judgment. The Companys long term return on asset (ROA) and discount rate assumptions are considered the key variables in determining pension expense or income. To develop the long term ROA assumption, the Company considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the Company has invested pension plan assets, and the expectations Table of Contents 37 for future returns of each asset class. Since the Companys investment policy is to employ active management strategies in all asset classes, the potential exists to outperform the broader markets, therefore, the expected returns are higher than the broader markets. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based upon an asset allocation within the Companys policy allocation ranges to develop the long term ROA assumption. The policy asset allocation ranges are between 50 and 76 percent equities with a 9.3% expected return, between 20 and 40 percent fixed income with a 6.6% expected return, between 2 and 7 percent real estate with a 9.9% expected return, and between 2 and 17 percent other (including private equity and cash) with a 12.4% expected return. The long term ROA assumption for the Companys domestic pension plans in 2005 is 8.75%. The discount rate assumption was determined by using a model consisting of theoretical bond portfolios that match the various durations of the Companys pension liability duration. The discount rate assumption for the Companys domestic pension plans in 2005 is 5.75%. The Companys pension expense is expected to be approximately $800 million in 2005 and $700 million in 2006. For every 2.5 percent that the actual domestic pension plan asset return exceeds or is less than the long term ROA assumption for 2005, the Companys pension expense for 2006 will change by approximately $15 million. If the Company adjusts the discount rate assumption for 2006 up or down by 25 basis points, the Companys pension expense for 2006 would change by approximately $45 million. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net sales were $20.2 billion in 2004, $18.1 billion in 2003, and $16.8 billion in 2002. The increase in sales was due primarily to higher U.S. Department of Defense expenditures in the Companys defense businesses, primarily Integrated Defense Systems and Space and Airborne Systems as well as higher sales at Raytheon Aircraft. Sales to the U.S. Department of Defense were 67 percent of sales in 2004, 65 percent in 2003, and 62 percent in 2002. Total sales to the U.S. government, including foreign military sales, were 74 percent of sales in 2004 and 2003 and 73 percent in 2002. International sales, including foreign military sales, were $3.7 billion or 18 percent of sales in 2004, $3.5 billion or 19 percent in 2003, and $3.5 billion or 21 percent in 2002. While international sales have remained essentially flat, the amount as a percent of sales has declined as a result of increased sales to the U.S. Department of Defense. Gross margin (net sales less cost of sales) was $3.3 billion in 2004, $3.1 billion in 2003, and $3.4 billion in 2002, or 16.4 percent of sales in 2004, 17.2 percent in 2003, and 20.3 percent in 2002. Included in gross margin was a FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment, described below, of $474 million of expense, $109 million of expense, and $210 million of income in 2004, 2003, and 2002, respectively. The change in the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment was due primarily to the reduction in the Companys discount rate assumption under SFAS No. 87 and the actual rate of return on pension plan assets in 2000 and 2001. The decrease in gross margin as a percent of sales in 2004 and 2003 was due to the increase in the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment. Also included in gross margin in 2003 were charges of $237 million at Network Centric Systems and $39 million at Technical Services. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS No. 87), outlines the methodology used to determine pension expense or income for financial reporting purposes, which is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements of pension plans, which are determined by other factors. A major factor in determining pension funding requirements are Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) that proscribe the allocation to and recovery of pension costs on U.S. government contracts. The difference between SFAS No. 87 (FAS) pension expense or income and CAS pension expense is reported as a separate line item in the Companys segment results called FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment. The results for each segment only include pension expense as determined under CAS, which can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. Table of Contents 38 Administrative and selling expenses were $1,433 million or 7.1 percent of sales in 2004, $1,306 million or 7.2 percent of sales in 2003, and $1,170 million or 7.0 percent of sales in 2002. Included in administrative and selling expenses in 2002 was a $29 million gain on the sale of the Companys corporate headquarters. Research and development expenses were $491 million or 2.4 percent of sales in 2004, $487 million or 2.7 percent of sales in 2003, and $449 million or 2.7 percent of sales in 2002. Operating income was $1,388 million or 6.9 percent of sales in 2004, $1,316 million or 7.3 percent of sales in 2003, and $1,783 million or 10.6 percent of sales in 2002. The changes in operating income by segment are described below in Segment Results. Interest expense from continuing operations was $418 million in 2004, $537 million in 2003, and $497 million in 2002. In 2002, the Company allocated $79 million of interest expense to discontinued operations. The Company did not allocate interest expense to discontinued operations in 2004 or 2003. Total interest expense was $576 million in 2002. The decrease in interest expense in 2004 was due to lower average debt. The decrease in interest expense in 2003 was due to a lower weighted average cost of borrowing. Interest income was $45 million in 2004, $50 million in 2003, and $27 million in 2002. The increase in interest income in 2003 was due to interest on long term receivables brought onto the Companys books as part of the buy out of the Companys aircraft receivables facility in the fourth quarter of 2002. Other expense, net was $436 million in 2004, $67 million in 2003, and $237 million in 2002. Included in other expense, net in 2004 was a $325 million charge related to the settlement of a securities class action lawsuit described below in Commitments and Contingencies and a $132 million charge related to the Companys repurchase of long term debt and subordinated notes payable described below in Capital Structure and Resources. Included in other expense, net in 2002 was a $175 million charge to write off the Companys investment in Space Imaging and accrue for a related credit facility guarantee which the Company paid in 2003, described below in Major Affiliated Entities. Other income and expense also includes equity income and losses in unconsolidated subsidiaries. The effective tax rate was 24.2 percent in 2004, 29.8 percent in 2003, and 29.7 percent in 2002, reflecting ESOP dividend deductions, export related tax benefits, and research and development tax credits applicable to certain government contracts. In addition, the 2004 tax rate included a $42 million benefit from the change in tax law primarily related to the extension of foreign tax credits from five to 10 years. At December 31, 2004, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of $835 million that expire in 2020 through 2023. Income from continuing operations was $439 million or $0.99 per diluted share on 442.2 million average shares outstanding in 2004, $535 million or $1.29 per diluted share on 415.4 million average shares outstanding in 2003, and $756 million or $1.85 per diluted share on 408.0 million average shares outstanding in 2002. The increase in average shares outstanding in 2004 was due to common stock issued in connection with the Companys equity security units described below in Capital Structure and Resources. The increase in average shares outstanding in 2003 was due to benefit plan related activity. The loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, described below in Discontinued Operations, was $63 million or $0.14 per diluted share in 2004, $170 million or $0.41 per diluted share in 2003, and $887 million or $2.17 per diluted share in 2002. Effective January 1, 2004, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans from October 31 to December 31. This change in measurement date was accounted for as a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was a gain of $53 million pretax for pension benefits and a gain of $10 million pretax for other postretirement benefits. Using the Companys year end as the measurement date for pension and other postretirement benefit plans more appropriately reflects the plans financial status for the years then ended. In 2004, the total cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle was a gain of $63 million pretax, $41 million after tax, or $0.09 per diluted share. Table of Contents 39 Effective January 1, 2002, the Company adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets (SFAS No. 142). This accounting standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for goodwill and other intangible assets and requires that periodic tests of goodwill impairment be performed. In 2002, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $360 million related to its former Aircraft Integration Systems business (AIS) as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. Due to the non deductibility of this goodwill, the Company did not record a tax benefit in connection with this impairment. Also in 2002, the Company completed the transitional review of the other businesses for potential goodwill impairment in accordance with SFAS No. 142 and recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $185 million pretax or $149 million after tax, which represented all of the goodwill at Raytheon Aircraft, as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle. The total goodwill impairment charge in 2002 was $545 million pretax, $509 million after tax, or $1.25 per diluted share. Net income was $417, million or $0.94 per diluted share in 2004 versus net income of $365 million or $0.88 per diluted share in 2003 and a net loss of $640 million or $1.57 per diluted share in 2002. SEGMENT RESULTS Reportable segments have been determined based upon product lines and include the following: Integrated Defense Systems, Intelligence and Information Systems, Missile Systems, Network Centric Systems, Space and Airborne Systems, Technical Services, Aircraft, and Other. Net Sales (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Integrated Defense Systems $ 3,456 $ 2,864 $ 2,366 Intelligence and Information Systems 2,215 2,045 1,887 Missile Systems 3,844 3,538 3,038 Network Centric Systems 3,113 2,809 3,091 Space and Airborne Systems 4,068 3,677 3,243 Technical Services 2,075 1,963 2,133 Aircraft 2,421 2,088 2,040 Other 675 573 210 Corporate and Eliminations (1,622 ) (1,448 ) (1,248 ) Total $ 20,245 $ 18,109 $ 16,760 Operating Income (In millions) 2004 2003 2002 Integrated Defense Systems $ 417 $ 331 $ 289 Intelligence and Information Systems 198 194 180 Missile Systems 436 424 373 Network Centric Systems 274 19 278 Space and Airborne Systems 568 492 428 Technical Services 151 107 116 Aircraft 63 2 (39 ) Other (40 ) (34 ) (12 ) FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment (474 ) (109 ) 210 Corporate and Eliminations (205 ) (110 ) (40 ) Total $ 1,388 $ 1,316 $ 1,783 Table of Contents 40 Operating Margin 2004 2003 2002 Integrated Defense Systems 12.1 % 11.6 % 12.2 % Intelligence and Information Systems 8.9 9.5 9.5 Missile Systems 11.3 12.0 12.3 Network Centric Systems 8.8 0.7 9.0 Space and Airborne Systems 14.0 13.4 13.2 Technical Services 7.3 5.5 5.4 Aircraft 2.6 0.1 (1.9 ) Other (5.9 ) (5.9 ) (5.7 ) FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment Corporate and Eliminations Total 6.9 % 7.3 % 10.6 % Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) provides mission systems integration for the air, surface, and subsurface battlespace. IDS had 2004 sales of $3.5 billion versus $2.9 billion in 2003 and $2.4 billion in 2002. The increase in sales in 2004 was due to continued growth on DD(X), the Navys future destroyer program. The increase in sales in 2003 was due to continued growth on DD(X) as well as strong missile defense sales. Operating income was $417 million in 2004, $331 million in 2003, and $289 million in 2002. The decrease in operating margin in 2003 was due to lower volume on higher margin international programs. Intelligence and Information Systems (IIS) provides signal and image processing, geospatial intelligence, airborne and spaceborne command and control, ground engineering support, weather and environmental management, and information technology. IIS had 2004 sales of $2.2 billion versus $2.0 billion in 2003 and $1.9 billion in 2002. The increase in sales in 2004 was due to growth in the DCGS (Distributed Common Ground System) program and growth in classified programs. The increase in sales in 2003 was due to strong growth in classified programs, as well as the start up of the NPOESS (National Polar orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite Systems) program. Operating income was $198 million in 2004 versus $194 million in 2003 and $180 million in 2002. Missile Systems (MS) provides air to air, precision strike, surface Navy air defense, and land combat missiles, guided projectiles, kinetic kill vehicles, and directed energy weapons. MS had 2004 sales of $3.8 billion versus $3.5 billion in 2003 and $3.0 billion in 2002. The increase in sales in 2004 was due to continued growth in missile defense, including work on the Standard Missile 3 program. The increase in sales in 2003 was due to the Tomahawk remanufacture program and Evolved Sea Sparrow Missile (ESSM) program reaching full rate production and several production programs transitioning from engineering development to low rate initial production including Air Intercept Missile (AIM 9X), and Tactical Tomahawk. Sales also increased on several missile defense programs in order to meet accelerated deployment. Operating income was $436 million in 2004 versus $424 million in 2003 and $373 million in 2002. The decline in operating margin in 2004 was due to the wind down of cost recovery for prior year restructuring actions. The costs related to these restructuring actions were accrued in 1997 through 2000, but are being recovered through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government over a five year period. The wind down of this recovery was substantially completed in 2004. Network Centric Systems (NCS) provides network centric solutions to integrate sensors, communications, and command and control to manage the battlespace. NCS had 2004 sales of $3.1 billion versus $2.8 billion in 2003 and $3.1 billion in 2002. Operating income was $274 million in 2004 versus $19 million in 2003 and $278 million in 2002. Included in 2003 were charges resulting in a reduction in sales and operating income of $228 million and $237 million, respectively, related to performance issues on certain NCS programs. Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) provides electro optical/infrared sensors, airborne radars, solid state high energy lasers, precision guidance systems, electronic warfare systems, and space qualified systems for civil and Table of Contents 41 military applications. SAS had 2004 sales of $4.1 billion versus $3.7 billion 2003 and $3.2 billion in 2002. The increase in sales in 2004 was due to growth in classified and international programs. The increase in sales in 2003 was due to higher sales on classified and Airborne Radar programs for the Air Force such as Multi Platform Radar Technology Insertion Program, B 2 Radar Modernization Program, F 15 Korea, and increased production of the F/A 22 Radar. Operating income was $568 million in 2004 versus $492 million in 2003 and $428 million in 2002. Operating income was higher in 2004 due primarily to productivity improvements on production programs and higher volume, partially offset by a $55 million charge on an international program as a result of a qualification test failure. Technical Services (TS) provides technical, scientific, and professional services for defense, federal, and commercial customers worldwide. TS had 2004 sales of $2.1 billion versus $2.0 billion in 2003 and $2.1 billion in 2002. The decrease in sales in 2003 was due to the loss of several key programs. Operating income was $151 million in 2004 versus $107 million in 2003 and $116 million in 2002. The decrease in operating income in 2003 was primarily due to write offs of $39 million related to an unfavorable change in scope on a long term contract of $22 million and a provision for the collectibility of certain unbilled costs of $17 million. Included in operating income for 2002 was a $28 million write off of contract costs that the Company determined to be unbillable. IDS, MS, NCS, SAS, and TS had sales growth rates in 2004 that were higher than the growth rates expected for 2005. The current market environment is consistent with the Companys planning assumptions and performance for the defense businesses, however, in the longer term, rising budget deficits, costs associated with current U.S. Department of Defense operations overseas, and other issues affecting the U.S. Department of Defense budget may represent a risk to future performance. Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) designs, manufactures, markets, and provides after market support for business jets, turbo props, and piston powered aircraft for the worlds commercial, fractional ownership, and military aircraft markets. RAC had 2004 sales of $2.4 billion versus $2.1 billion in 2003 and $2.0 billion in 2002. The increase in sales in 2004 was primarily due to higher new aircraft sales. Operating income was $63 million in 2004 versus $2 million in 2003 and an operating loss of $39 million in 2002. The increase in operating income in 2004 was due to higher volume on new aircraft sales as well as productivity and cost savings initiatives implemented throughout 2003 and 2004. The increase in operating income in 2003 was due to higher productivity and cost saving initiatives implemented during 2003. Included in 2004 operating income was a $34 million favorable profit adjustment on the T 6A Texan II military training aircraft (T 6A) program. Included in 2003 operating income was a $50 million favorable profit adjustment on the T 6A program partially offset by a $22 million charge on the Premier program reflecting cost estimate increases. Included in 2002 operating income was a $22 million favorable profit adjustment on the T 6A program. The favorable profit adjustments on the T 6A program in 2004, 2003, and 2002 were due to option exercises and productivity improvements. The Company has made significant investments in its Premier and Horizon aircrafts, the realization of which is contingent upon future sales at forecasted prices and reductions in production costs on future deliveries. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Federal Aviation Administration granted a provisional type certification for the Horizon aircraft. Revenue has not been recognized on the first Horizon aircraft as the Company leased this aircraft back from the customer for demonstration and operational evaluation purposes. The Other segment, which is comprised of Flight Options LLC (FO), Raytheon Airline Aviation Services LLC (RAAS), and Raytheon Professional Services LLC (RPS) had 2004 sales of $675 million versus $573 million in 2003 and $210 million in 2002. FO offers services in the aircraft fractional ownership industry. RAAS manages the Companys commuter aircraft business. RPS works with customers to design and execute learning solutions. The increase in sales in 2004 and 2003 was primarily due to the consolidation of FO in June 2003 as described below in Major Affiliated Entities. The Other segment had an operating loss of $40 million in 2004 versus $34 million in 2003 and $12 million in 2002. Table of Contents 42 Commuter aircraft customers are generally thinly capitalized companies that are dependent on the commuter aircraft industry. A downturn in this industry could have a material adverse effect on these customers and the Company. At December 31, 2004 and December 31, 2003, the Companys exposure on commuter aircraft related assets was approximately $560 million consisting of 297 aircraft and approximately $650 million consisting of 349 aircraft, respectively.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In 2000, the Company sold its Raytheon Engineers & Constructors businesses (RE&C) to Washington Group International, Inc. (WGI). In May 2001, WGI filed for bankruptcy protection. As a result, the Company was required to perform under various contract and lease obligations in connection with a number of different projects Table of Contents 43 under letters of credit, surety bonds, and guarantees (Support Agreements) that it had provided to project owners and other parties. For several of these projects, the Company has entered into settlement agreements that resolve the Companys obligations under the related Support Agreements. On a number of these projects, the Company is continuing closeout efforts which includes warranty obligations, commercial close out, and claims resolution. There are also Support Agreements on projects where WGI is continuing to perform work which could present risk to the Company if WGI fails to meet its obligations in connection with these projects. In meeting the obligations under the remaining Support Agreements, the Company has various risks and exposures, including delays, equipment and subcontractor performance, warranty close out, various liquidated damages issues, collection of amounts due under contracts, and potential adverse claims resolution under various contracts and leases. In August 2004, AES Red Oak LLC drew $30 million on a letter of credit provided by the Company. AES Red Oak LLC is the owner of the Red Oak power project in Sayreville, NJ, and there is a dispute between the Company and AES Red Oak LLC regarding the closeout of this project. The letter of credit was provided to AES Red Oak LLC in 2002 in lieu of the owner withholding retainage from periodic construction milestone payments. In 2004, 2003, and 2002, the pretax loss from discontinued operations related to RE&C was $42 million, $231 million, and $966 million, respectively. In 2004, the Company recorded a $24 million charge for an estimated liability for foreign tax related matters. Although not expected to be material, additional losses on foreign tax related matters could be recorded in the future as estimates are revised or the underlying matters are settled. Included in 2003 and 2002 were charges of $176 million and $796 million, respectively, related to two construction projects, the Mystic Station facility in Everett, MA and the Fore River facility in Weymouth, MA. Following WGIs abandonment of these projects in 2001, the Company undertook construction efforts and subsequently delivered care, custody, and control of these projects to their owners in 2003 and closed on a settlement agreement with the project owners and other interested parties in 2004. The charges resulted from delays, labor and material cost growth, productivity issues, equipment and subcontractor performance, schedule liquidated damages, inaccurate estimates of field engineered materials, and disputed changes. In 2002, the Company allocated $79 million of interest expense to RE&C based upon actual cash outflows since the date of disposition. Since the projects were nearing completion, the Company did not allocate interest expense to RE&C after 2002. Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations related to RE&C was $61 million in 2004 versus $513 million in 2003 and $1,129 million in 2002. In 2002, the Company sold its Aircraft Integration Systems business (AIS) for $1,123 million, net, subject to purchase price adjustments. The Company is currently involved in a purchase price dispute related to the sale of AIS in which the purchaser has claimed a purchase price adjustment of $85 million. The Company disputes this claim and expects the matter to be resolved in arbitration. There was no pretax gain or loss on the sale of AIS, however, due to the non deductible goodwill associated with AIS, the Company recorded a tax provision of $212 million resulting in a $212 million after tax loss on the sale of AIS. As part of the transaction, the Company retained the responsibility for performance of the Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) program and retained certain assets related to the BBJ program, which is now essentially complete. In 2004, 2003, and 2002, the pretax loss from discontinued operations related to AIS was $23 million, $30 million, and $47 million, respectively, primarily related to the completion of the BBJ program. In 2004, the total loss from discontinued operations was $65 million pretax, $63 million after tax, or $0.14 per basic and diluted share versus $261 million pretax, $170 million after tax or $0.41 per basic and diluted share in 2003 and $1,013 million pretax, $887 million after tax, or $2.21 per basic share and $2.17 per diluted share in 2002. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY Net cash provided by operating activities in 2004 was $2,071 million versus $2,034 million in 2003. Net cash used in operating activities was $349 million in 2002. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations Table of Contents 44 was $2,114 million in 2004 versus $2,567 million in 2003 and $847 million in 2002. Included in 2004 was a $210 million payment made in connection with the settlement of the class action lawsuit described below in Commitments and Contingencies. As the Company continues to convert portions of existing financial systems to a new integrated financial package, certain planned delays in billings to customers may occur during 2005, however, the Company does not expect these delays to negatively impact full year cash flow results. Savings and investment plan activity includes certain items related to the Companys 401(k) plan that were funded through the issuance of the Companys common stock and are non cash operating activities included on the statement of cash flows. In 2004, the Company began funding its 401(k) plan match with cash. Total contributions (required and discretionary) related to the Companys pension plans are expected to be approximately $515 million in 2005. The Company provides long term financing to its aircraft customers. Origination of financing receivables was $325 million in 2004, $402 million in 2003, and $431 million in 2002. The Company received proceeds of $59 million in 2004 and $279 million in 2003 related to the sale of certain general aviation finance receivables, described below in Off Balance Sheet Financing Arrangements. The Company also maintained a program under which it sold general aviation and commuter aircraft long term receivables under a receivables purchase facility through the end of 2002. In connection with this program in 2002, the sale of financing receivables was $263 million and the repurchase of financing receivables was $347 million. The Company bought out the receivables that remained in the facility in 2002 for $1,029 million, brought the related assets onto the Companys books, and eliminated the associated $1.4 billion receivables purchase facility. Net cash used in investing activities was $532 million in 2004 versus $708 million in 2003. Net cash provided by investing activities was $669 million in 2002. Capital expenditures were $363 million in 2004, $428 million in 2003, and $458 million in 2002. Capital expenditures in 2005 are expected to approximate $385 million. In 1998, the Company entered into a $490 million property sale and five year operating lease (synthetic lease) facility under which property, plant, and equipment was sold and leased back to the Company. In 2003, the lease facility expired and the Company bought back the assets remaining in the lease facility for $125 million. Capitalized expenditures for internal use software were $103 million in 2004, $98 million in 2003, and $138 million in 2002. Capitalized expenditures for internal use software in 2005 are expected to approximate $115 million. Proceeds from the sale of operating units and investments were $47 million in 2004 versus $111 million in 2003 and $1,166 million in 2002. In 2004, the Company sold its commercial infrared business for $43 million. In 2003, the Company sold the remaining interest in its former aviation support business for $97 million. In 2002, the Company sold its AIS business for $1,123 million, described above in Discontinued Operations. In 2004, the Company paid the second installment of $70 million related to the 2003 acquisition of Solipsys Corporation. The final installment of $60 million is due in the first quarter of 2005. Also in 2004, the Company paid $42 million for the acquisition of Photon Research Associates, Inc. In 2003, the Company paid $130 million related to the Space Imaging credit facility guarantee, described below in Major Affiliated Entities. In October 2001, the Company and Hughes Electronics agreed to a settlement regarding the purchase price adjustment related to the Companys merger with the defense business of Hughes Electronics Corporation. Under the terms of the agreement, Hughes Electronics agreed to reimburse the Company approximately $635 million of its purchase price over time, with the final payment received in 2002. Net cash used in financing activities was $1,644 million in 2004 versus $1,209 million in 2003 and $990 million in 2002. Dividends paid to stockholders were $349 million in 2004, $331 million in 2003, and $321 million in 2002. The quarterly dividend rate was $0.20 per share for each of the four quarters of 2004, 2003, and 2002. Beginning in 2005, the Company plans to increase the quarterly dividend rate to $0.22 per share. Although the Company does not have a formal dividend policy, management believes that a reasonable dividend payout ratio based on the current industry environment and market conditions is approximately one third of the Companys economic Table of Contents 45 earnings (income excluding FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment). Dividends are subject to approval by the Board of Directors. CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND RESOURCES Total debt was $5.2 billion at December 31, 2004 and $7.4 billion at December 31, 2003. Cash and cash equivalents were $556 million at December 31, 2004 and $661 million at December 31, 2003. The Companys outstanding debt has interest rates ranging from 4.5% to 8.3% and matures at various dates through 2028. Total debt as a percentage of total capital was 32.8 percent and 44.7 percent at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. In 2004, the Company repurchased long term debt and subordinated notes payable with a par value of $2,254 million. In 2003, the Company issued $425 million of long term debt and used the proceeds to reduce the amounts outstanding under the Companys lines of credit. Also in 2003, the Company issued $500 million of fixed rate long term debt and $200 million of floating rate notes and used the proceeds to partially fund the repurchase of long term debt with a par value of $924 million. The Company has on file a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the issuance of up to $3.0 billion in debt securities, common or preferred stock, warrants to purchase any of the aforementioned securities, and or stock purchase contracts, under which $1.3 billion remained outstanding at December 31, 2004. A substantial portion of the remaining availability under the shelf registration is expected to be used in connection with the settlement of the class action lawsuit, described below in Commitments and Contingencies. In 2002, the Company issued $575 million of long term debt to reduce the amounts outstanding under the Companys lines of credit. Also in 2002, the Company repurchased debt with a par value of $96 million. The Company enters into various interest rate swaps that correspond to a portion of the Companys fixed rate debt in order to effectively hedge interest rate risk. In 2002, the Company closed out certain of these interest rate swaps and received proceeds of $95 million which are being amortized over the remaining life of the debt as a reduction to interest expense. At December 31, 2004, the unamortized balance was $14 million. The $600 million notional value of interest rate swaps that remained outstanding at December 31, 2004 effectively converted that portion of the Companys total debt to variable rate debt. The Companys most restrictive bank agreement covenant is an interest coverage ratio that currently requires earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA), excluding certain charges, to be at least 3.0 times net interest expense for the prior four quarters. In July 2003, the covenant was amended to exclude pretax charges of $100 million related to RE&C and in October 2003, the covenant was further amended to exclude $226 million of pretax charges related to Network Centric Systems and Technical Services and $78 million of pretax charges related to RE&C. The Company was in compliance with the interest coverage ratio covenant, as amended, during 2004 and expects to continue to be in compliance throughout 2005. Credit ratings for the Company were assigned by Fitchs at F3 for short term borrowing and BBB for senior debt, by Moodys at P 3 for short term borrowing and Baa3 for senior debt, and by Standard and Poors at A 3 for short term borrowing and BBB for senior debt. Lines of credit with certain commercial banks exist to provide short term liquidity. The lines of credit bear interest based upon LIBOR and were $2.3 billion at December 31, 2004, consisting of $1.0 billion which matures in May 2005 and $1.3 billion which matures in 2006. The lines of credit were $2.7 billion at December 31, 2003. There were no borrowings under the lines of credit at December 31, 2004, however, the Company had approximately $100 million of outstanding letters of credit which effectively reduced the Companys borrowing capacity under the lines of credit to $2.2 billion. There were no borrowings under the lines of credit at December 31, 2003. In 2001, the Company issued 17,250,000, 8.25% equity security units. Each equity security unit consisted of a contract to purchase shares of the Companys common stock on May 15, 2004 and a mandatorily redeemable equity security, with a stated liquidation amount of $50 due on May 15, 2006, which will require a cash payment by Table of Contents 46 the Company. In 2004, in accordance with the terms of the equity security units, the Company received proceeds of $863 million and issued 27.0 million shares of common stock. The terms of the equity security units required that the mandatorily redeemable equity securities be remarketed. On February 11, 2004, the mandatorily redeemable equity securities were remarketed and the quarterly distribution rate was reset at 7.0%. The Companys need for, cost of, and access to funds are dependent on future operating results, as well as conditions external to the Company. Cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, proceeds from divestitures, and other available financing resources are expected to be sufficient to meet anticipated operating, capital expenditure, and debt service requirements during the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS In 2004, the Company entered into an agreement to sell certain general aviation finance receivables, with the buyer assuming all servicing responsibilities. As part of the agreement, the Company retains a first loss deficiency guarantee of 7.5% of the receivable amount sold. In 2004, $37 million of receivables were sold under the agreement, with no associated gain or loss. Also in 2004, the Company sold $22 million of general aviation finance receivables without any continuing involvement. In 2003, the Company sold $337 million of general aviation finance receivables to a qualifying special purpose entity which in turn issued beneficial interests in these receivables to a commercial paper conduit, received proceeds of $279 million, retained a subordinated interest in and servicing rights to the receivables, and recognized a gain of $2 million. The sale was non recourse to the Company, and effectively reduced the Companys exposure to general aviation market risk for receivables by approximately 25 percent. At December 31, 2004 and 2003, the outstanding balance of securitized accounts receivable held by the third party conduit totaled $204 million and $320 million, respectively, of which the Companys subordinated retained interest was $58 million and the fair value of the servicing asset was $4 million and $6 million, respectively. In 2001, the Company formed a joint venture, Thales Raytheon Systems (TRS), described below in Major Affiliated Entities. The Company has guaranteed TRS related borrowings of up to $34 million under which $12 million was outstanding at December 31, 2004. The Company has also entered into other joint ventures, also described below in Major Affiliated Entities. TRS and the other joint ventures, in the normal course of business, have banks issue letters of credit and guarantees related to project performance and other contractual obligations. While the Company expects these joint ventures to satisfy their loan, project performance, and other contractual obligations, their failure to do so may result in a future obligation for the Company. In 1997, the Company provided a first loss guarantee of $133 million on $1.3 billion of U.S. Export Import Bank loans (maturing in 2015) to the Brazilian government related to the System for the Vigilance of the Amazon (SIVAM) program being performed by the Companys Network Centric Systems segment. MAJOR AFFILIATED ENTITIES In 2002, the Company formed a joint venture, Flight Options LLC (FO), whereby the Company contributed its Raytheon Travel Air fractional ownership business and loaned the new entity $20 million. In June 2003, the Company participated in a financial recapitalization of FO. The Company now owns approximately 65 percent of FO and is consolidating FOs results in its financial statements. Prior to the financial recapitalization, 100 percent of FOs $20 million of losses were recorded as other expense in the first six months of 2003 since the Company had been meeting all of FOs financing requirements. The consolidation of FO did not have a significant effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations, although the Companys reported revenue, operating income, and other expense changed as a result of the consolidation of FOs results. The Company is recording 100 percent of FOs losses since the Company has been meeting all FOs financing requirements. FOs customers, in certain instances, have the contractual ability to require FO to buy back their fractional share at its current fair market value. The estimated value of this potential obligation was approximately $575 million at December 31, 2004. Table of Contents 47 In 1995, through the acquisition of E Systems, Inc., the Company invested in Space Imaging and currently has a 31 percent equity investment in Space Imaging LLC. In 2002, the Company recorded a $175 million charge to write off the Companys investment in Space Imaging and accrue for payment under the Companys guarantee of a Space Imaging credit facility that matured in March 2003. In the first quarter of 2003, the Company paid $130 million related to the credit facility guarantee. In exchange for this payment, the Company received a note from Space Imaging for this amount that the Company has valued at zero. Investments, which are included in other assets, consisted of the following at December 31: (In millions) 2004Ownership % 2004 2003 Equity method investments: Thales Raytheon Systems Co. Ltd. 50.0 $ 87 $ 78 HRL Laboratories, LLC 33.3 30 30 Indra ATM S.L. 49.0 12 12 TelASIC Communications 23.5 3 7 Other n/a 7 9 139 136 Other investments 10 10 Total $ 149 $ 146 In 2001, the Company formed a joint venture, Thales Raytheon Systems (TRS), that has two major operating subsidiaries, one of which the Company controls and consolidates. TRS is a system of systems integrator and provides fully customized solutions through the integration of command and control centers, radars, and communication networks. HRL Laboratories is a scientific research facility whose staff engages in the areas of space and defense technologies. Indra develops flight data processors for air traffic control automation systems. TelASIC Communications delivers high performance, cost effective radio frequency (RF), analog mixed signal, and digital solutions for both the commercial and defense electronics markets. In addition, the Company has entered into joint ventures formed specifically to facilitate a teaming arrangement between two contractors for the benefit of the customer, generally the U.S. government, whereby the Company receives a subcontract from the joint venture in the joint ventures capacity as prime contractor. Accordingly, the Company records the work it performs for the joint venture as operating activity. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to remediation of various environmental sites. The Companys estimate of total environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred is $130 million. Discounted at a weighted average risk free rate of 5.8 percent, the Company estimated the liability to be $92 million before U.S. government recovery and had this amount accrued at December 31, 2004. A portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. The recovery of environmental cleanup costs from the U.S. government is considered probable based on the Companys long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs. Accordingly, the Company has recorded $59 million at December 31, 2004 for the estimated future recovery of these costs from the U.S. government, which is included in contracts in process. The Company leases certain government owned properties and is generally not liable for environmental remediation at these sites, therefore, no provision has been made in the financial statements for these costs. Due to the complexity of environmental laws and regulations, the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup methods and technologies, the uncertainty of insurance coverage, and the unresolved extent of the Companys responsibility, it is difficult to determine the ultimate outcome of these matters, however, any additional liability is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. Table of Contents 48 The Company issues guarantees and has banks and surety companies issue, on its behalf, letters of credit and surety bonds to meet various bid, performance, warranty, retention, advance payment, and certain financial obligations. Approximately $294 million, $827 million, and $250 million of these guarantees, letters of credit, and surety bonds, for which there were stated values, were outstanding at December 31, 2004, respectively and $354 million, $890 million, and $389 million were outstanding at December 31, 2003, respectively. These instruments expire on various dates through 2015. At December 31, 2004, the amount of guarantees, letters of credit, and surety bonds, for which there were stated values, that remained outstanding was $94 million, $9 million, and $234 million, respectively, related to discontinued operations and are included in the numbers above compared to $99 million, $146 million, and $283 million, respectively, at December 31, 2003. Additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no stated value also remain outstanding. Defense contractors are subject to many levels of audit and investigation. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Department of Defense Inspector General, the Government Accountability Office, the Department of Justice, and Congressional Committees. The Department of Justice, from time to time, has convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by the Company. Individually and in the aggregate, these investigations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. The Company continues to cooperate with the staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on a formal investigation related to the Companys accounting practices primarily related to the commuter aircraft business and the timing of revenue recognition at Raytheon Aircraft. The Company has been providing documents and information to the SEC staff. In addition, certain present and former officers and employees of the Company have provided testimony in connection with this investigation. The Company is unable to predict the outcome of the investigation or any action that the SEC might take. In May 2004, without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the Company reached an agreement to settle a securities class action lawsuit originally filed in 1999 on behalf of the Company and all individual defendants. The terms of the settlement include a cash payment of $210 million and the issuance of warrants for the Companys stock with a stipulated value of $200 million. The warrants will have a five year term with a strike price of $37.50 and will be issued when the settlement proceeds are distributed to the claimants which is expected to occur in 2005. In December 2004, the court approved the settlement, resolving all claims asserted against the Company and the individual defendants. In connection with the settlement, the Company recorded a charge of $329 million, of which $325 million was included in other expense, a $410 million accrued expense, and an $85 million receivable for insurance proceeds primarily related to this settlement. The charge for the settlement will be revised in future quarters to reflect changes in the fair value of the warrants after they are issued. In 2004, the Company paid $210 million into escrow in connection with the settlement. In July 2004, without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the Company and the individual defendants reached a tentative agreement to settle a derivative action related to the class action lawsuit described above. The settlement, which is subject to court approval, will resolve all claims in the case and is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In June 2001, a class action lawsuit was filed on behalf of all purchasers of common stock or senior notes of WGI during the class period of April 17, 2000 through March 1, 2001 (the WGI Complaint). The plaintiff class claims to have suffered harm by purchasing WGI securities because the Company and certain of its officers allegedly violated federal securities laws by misrepresenting the true financial condition of RE&C in order to sell RE&C to WGI at an artificially inflated price. An amended complaint was filed in October 2001 alleging similar claims. The Company and the individual defendants filed a motion seeking to dismiss the action in November 2001. In April 2002, the motion to dismiss was denied. In September 2002, the defendants filed an answer to the amended Table of Contents 49 complaint and discovery is proceeding. In April 2003, the court conditionally certified the class and defined the class period as that between April 17, 2000 and March 2, 2001, inclusive. In July 2001, the Company was named as a nominal defendant and all of its directors at the time were named as defendants in two identical purported derivative lawsuits. These lawsuits were consolidated into one action (the Consolidated Amended Derivative Complaint) in January 2004 and contain allegations similar to those included in the WGI Complaint and further allege that the individual defendants breached fiduciary duties to the Company and failed to maintain systems necessary for prudent management and control of the Companys operations. In March 2004, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Consolidated Amended Derivative Complaint. In November 2004, without admitting any liability or wrongdoing, the individual defendants and the Company reached a tentative agreement to settle this derivative action. The settlement, which is subject to court approval, will resolve all claims in the case and is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. In May 2003, two purported class action lawsuits were filed on behalf of participants in the Companys savings and investment plans who invested in the Companys stock between August 19, 1999 and May 27, 2003. The two class action complaints are brought pursuant to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA). Both lawsuits are substantially similar and have been consolidated into a single action. In April 2004, a second consolidated amended complaint (the Second Consolidated Amended ERISA Complaint) was filed on behalf of participants and beneficiaries in the Companys savings and investment plans who invested in the Companys stock since October 7, 1998. The Second Consolidated Amended ERISA Complaint alleges that the Company, its Pension and Investment Group, and its Investment Committee breached ERISA fiduciary duties by failing to: (1) prudently and loyally manage plan assets, (2) monitor the Pension and Investment Group and the Investment Committee and provide them with accurate information, (3) provide complete and accurate information to plan participants and beneficiaries, and (4) avoid conflicts of interest. In October 2004, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the Second Consolidated Amended ERISA Complaint. Although the Company believes that it and the other defendants have meritorious defenses to each and all of the aforementioned class action and derivative complaints and intends, except as to the tentative settlements noted above, to contest each lawsuit vigorously, an adverse resolution of any of the lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position and results of operations. The Company is not presently able to reasonably estimate potential losses, if any, related to any of the lawsuits, except as noted above. In addition, various claims and legal proceedings generally incidental to the normal course of business are pending or threatened against the Company. While the ultimate liability from these proceedings is presently indeterminable, any additional liability is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position or results of operations. The following is a schedule of the Companys contractual obligations outstanding (excluding working capital items) at December 31, 2004: (In millions) Total Lessthan 1Year 13years 45years After 5years Debt $ 4,779 $ 516 $ 685 $ 310 $ 3,268 Subordinated notes payable 382 382 Interest payments 2,803 323 552 433 1,495 Operating leases 1,359 340 470 266 283 IT outsourcing 343 71 136 136 Total $ 9,666 $ 1,250 $ 2,225 $ 1,145 $ 5,046 Interest payments include interest on debt that is redeemable at the option of the Company. Table of Contents 50 The Company currently estimates that required pension plan cash contributions will be approximately $315 million in 2005 and $445 million in 2006. The Company also plans to make discretionary cash contributions of $200 million in 2005 and 2006. These estimates are based upon certain assumptions, outlined above in Critical Accounting Policies, and contemplate passage of the Pension Funding Equity Act, which will provide a certain amount of pension funding relief to the Company. The estimate for 2006 is subject to change and will not be known with certainty until the Companys SFAS No. 87 assumptions are updated at the end of 2005. Estimates for 2007 and beyond have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts, which are subject to change until the Companys SFAS No. 87 assumptions can be updated at the appropriate times. In addition, pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government, therefore, the amounts noted above are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions will have on the Companys liquidity. At December 31, 2004, RAC had unconditional purchase obligations of $40 million primarily related to component parts for the Horizon aircraft with varying purchase quantities for up to 200 aircraft. In addition, the Companys defense businesses may enter into purchase commitments which can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. These unconditional purchase obligations are not included in the table above. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payments (SFAS No. 123R). This accounting standard, which is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005, requires the recognition of compensation expense related to stock options under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. The Company plans to adopt SFAS No. 123R prospectively in the third quarter of 2005 with an anticipated impact to earnings per share of less than $0.02 per share in 2005 and 2006. In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 151, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Costs (SFAS No. 151). This accounting standard, which is effective for annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005, requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position or results or operations. Table of Contents 51 Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk The Companys primary market exposures are to interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company meets its working capital requirements with a combination of variable rate short term and fixed rate long term financing. The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements with commercial and investment banks to manage interest rates associated with the Companys financing arrangements. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts with commercial banks to fix the dollar value of specific commitments and payments to international vendors and the value of foreign currency denominated receipts. The market risk sensitive instruments used by the Company for hedging are entered into with commercial and investment banks and are directly related to a particular asset, liability, or transaction for which a commitment is in place. Financial instruments held by the Company which are subject to interest rate risk include notes payable, long term debt, long term receivables, investments, and interest rate swap agreements. The aggregate hypothetical loss in earnings for one year of those financial instruments held by the Company at December 31, 2004 and 2003, which are subject to interest rate risk resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 10 percent, was approximately $1 million after tax for both years. Fixed rate financial instruments were not evaluated, as the risk exposure is not material. The Company believes its exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates is not material due to the Companys hedging policy and the fact that the Company does not enter into speculative hedges.
