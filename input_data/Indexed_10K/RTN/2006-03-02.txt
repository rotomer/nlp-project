ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Raytheon Company and its subsidiaries (Raytheon or the Company) is one of the largest defense electronics contractors in the world, serving all branches of the U.S. military and other U.S. government agencies, NATO, and many allied governments. The Company is a leader in its core defense markets: radars and radio frequency systems; infrared and electro optical sensors and systems; missiles and precision weapons; and command, control, communications, computer and intelligence systems. In all of these markets, the Company provides full life cycle services to its customers, including product design, delivery, and mission support. Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC or Raytheon Aircraft) is a leading provider of business and special mission aircraft and delivers a broad line of jet, turboprop, and piston powered airplanes to individual, corporate, and government customers worldwide. The Company operates in seven principal business segments: Integrated Defense Systems (IDS); Intelligence and Information Systems (IIS); Missile Systems (MS); Network Centric Systems (NCS); Space and Airborne Systems (SAS); Technical Services (RTSC); and Aircraft. For a more detailed description of the segments, see Business Segments within Item 1 of this Form 10 K. Defense Industry Considerations The global War on Terrorism, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom have altered the defense and security environment of the United States and have had, and for the foreseeable future are likely to continue to have, a significant impact on the markets for defense and advanced technology systems and products. The U.S. Department of Defense (the DoD) continues to focus on both supporting ongoing operations in Afghanistan and Iraq and transforming the U.S. military to confront future threats. In addition, the Office of Homeland Security and other government agencies continue to focus on enhancing the security of our homeland. To further these priorities, the Companys defense customers have been focusing on the development of the following defense capabilities: speed, precision, flexibility, and the ability to share knowledge and information. With these capabilities, forces should be better able to seize and sustain initiative, concentrate combat power, and prevent an enemy response. The development and integration of advanced technologies and defense electronics is critical to this new approach. Overall U.S. defense spending has increased in recent years in connection with the foregoing changes, and the congressionally mandated Quadrennial Defense Review (QDR) released by the DoD in February 2006 indicates continued support of the changes. The QDR recommends certain changes to force structure, particularly with respect to special operations forces, relating to the global War on Terrorism and the insurgency in Iraq. However, at the same time, the QDR also largely maintains the DoDs transformation initiatives that the Company has supported over the last several years. Specifically, the QDR sets forth the following transformation priorities for which the Company is a key contributor: Continued broad emphasis on net centricity, with the Companys Distributed Common Ground System at its core; Continued development of the U.S. Armys Future Combat Systems, which the Company supports through its Ground Sensor Integrator, Battle Command Management and Execution, and Non Line of Sight Launch System efforts; Continued production of DD(X), the U.S. Navys next generation surface combatant, for which the Company is the prime system integrator; and Acceleration of the deployment of Global Hawk and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles, both of which carry Company payloads and systems. The Presidents fiscal year 2007 budget and Future Years Defense Plan (FYDP), which projects defense costs for the next five years, are generally consistent with the QDRs recommendations. Within the DoD budget, the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation budget and the Procurement budget, collectively known as the investment accounts, are a key source of funding for the Companys programs. These investment accounts show continued growth throughout the FYDP. The Company also receives substantial revenue from the DoD Operations and Maintenance accounts, which are also expected to continue to grow, and from the supplemental funds required to support ongoing operations. 31 Table of Contents Internationally, the threat of additional terrorist activity, coupled with conventional military threats, has led to a continued strong market. In some cases, these opportunities span what in the U.S. would be termed defense and homeland security. Because of the breadth of the Companys offerings, its systems integration capability, and its strong legacy in the international market, management believes that the Company is well positioned for continued success in that market. Aircraft Industry Considerations As the general U.S. economic conditions have improved over the past few years, the general aviation market has been improving as well. Although still below its peak performance in 2001, the industrys 2005 performance reflected the second consecutive year of improvement compared to the industrys depressed levels of activity in 2002 and 2003. Raytheon Aircraft Companys market is also influenced in part by the capital goods sector and the demand for general aviation products by businesses both domestically and internationally, the U.S. and other governments, as well as high net worth individuals. Traditionally, the used aircraft market has led the recovery of the new aircraft market by 9 12 months and although worldwide levels of used aircraft available for sale have declined over the last 24 months, a downturn in economic conditions could slow or delay market demand for used and therefore ultimately new aircraft. The decline in the worldwide fleet of used aircraft available for sale, especially late model aircraft less than 10 years old, has resulted in improved pricing and demand of new aircraft and many manufacturers have increased line or production rates. In order to support a continued recovery of the new aircraft market, however, the current worldwide inventory of used aircraft available for sale must be maintained or in some cases reduced even further. Due to the lower levels of used inventory and strong order activity during the second half of 2005, the industry consensus is that the demand for new aircraft will continue to improve in 2006. Additionally, the introduction of new or upgraded products is also expected to drive increased market demand for products across the industry. Company Strategy Raytheon is focused on four strategic imperatives: Grow its position in core defense markets through a focus on key strategic pursuits, Mission Support, technology and Mission Assurance; Use its Strategic Business Areas (SBAs) to leverage domain knowledge of core defense markets across the company to achieve growth and to expand its Mission Systems Integration opportunities; Establish the Beechcraft and Hawker brands as the aircraft industry standard for quality, service and support; and Be a customer focused company based on performance, relationships and solutions. Mission Support focuses on enabling customer success through total life cycle support that predicts customer needs, senses potential problems, and proactively responds with the most appropriate solutions. Mission Assurance is the commitment to meld the Companys technologies into the most reliable integrated mission systems in the world to address urgent defense, security, and aircraft needs. Raytheons four SBAs are Missile Defense, Precision Engagement, Homeland Security and Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance, which are critical markets for the Company. Mission Systems Integration (MSI) is the integration of multiple systems (e.g., sensors, C4I, weapons) to deliver a solution to accomplish a specific mission for a customer. MSI requires a thorough understanding of the mission, the systems being integrated, and the concept of operations. To establish the Beechcraft and Hawker brands, Raytheon is focusing on upgrading its existing portfolio of general aviation aircraft, improving cost competitiveness and flexibility, and providing true Mission Assurance to its customers. To be a customer focused company, Raytheon believes that it must (1) perform, by making and keeping its promises to customers, (2) continually listen, anticipate, respond and follow through with its customers, partners and each other, and (3) develop and provide superior customer solutions. 32 Table of Contents In addition, the Company is focused on the following financial indicators: Bookings and sales; Operating income; Cash generation; and Efficient and effective deployment of capital, as measured by Return on Invested Capital (ROIC). The Company uses these and other measures to assess the performance of the Company and its business segments as well as for executive compensation purposes. Given the strength of its technologies, domain knowledge, processes, and other resources, the Company believes that it is well positioned to execute on its strategy and capitalize on the trends in the markets in which it operates and meet its financial objectives and goals. Technology Raytheons ability to execute its strategy is enhanced by its technical capabilities and domain knowledge in four core areas: Radio Frequency (RF); Electro optics and Infrared (EO/IR); Missiles and other precision guided munitions; and Command and Control, Communications, Computers and Intelligence (C4I). The Company leverages these technologies across its products and business units. RF key capabilities include radar, missile seekers, communications, electronic warfare, and directed energy weapons. Major 2005 awards include the Taiwan SRP long range radar contract and the Joint Land Attack Cruise Missile Defense Elevated Netted Sensor (JLENS) contract modification. Raytheon is also continuing to develop critical Gallium Nitride semiconductor technology which will support future applications. EO/IR capabilities range from sensors and systems that allow the warfighter to see the extended battlespace across space, airborne, and surface domains, to technologies that enable night vision and precision strike missions. Raytheon should continue to gain EO/IR opportunities through the U.S. Armys modularity initiatives. Missile capabilities include using the missile as a node in the network, urban warfare applications, and lethal and non lethal applications. Key 2005 achievements in this area include the Non Line of Sight Launch System (NLOS LS) Precision Attack Missile award and continuing success with Standard Missile 3. C4I key capabilities include situational awareness, persistent surveillance, communications, mission planning, battle management command and control, sensors and payloads, intelligence and analysis, and integrated ground solutions. Key 2005 accomplishments in this area include a number of international awards, such as Joint Effects Tactical Targeting System (JETTS) in the UK, as well as executing a rapid response on the Persistent Surveillance Dissemination System of Systems (PSDS2). Strategic Business Areas The Companys strategy is designed to capitalize on the breadth and depth of the Companys technologies and domain expertise in order to meet the evolving needs of the Companys customers. The Company is focusing on the following Strategic Business Areas critical markets that are aligned with the ongoing military operations, the DoD transformation priorities, and the priorities of the Department of Homeland Security. Raytheon is working to identify opportunities and, through the collaboration of the Companys business units that offer substantial capabilities in these areas, develop integrated solutions to address these areas. Missile Defense. The Company is working with the U.S. Missile Defense Agency and other companies to develop an operational Ballistic Missile Defense System, a layered system that will detect, identify, and intercept missiles in all phases of flight the boost, midcourse, and terminal phases. The fundamental components of integrated missile defense are sensors, interceptors, command and control, and systems integration. The Company is a technology leader in all of these areas. The Companys broad array of solutions provides the capability to detect and respond to threats at all three phases of the missile defense system. The Companys programs addressing all three phases include Ballistic Missile Defense System Radar, Space Tracking and Surveillance System, and Cobra Judy Radar. The Companys programs addressing the boost phase include Kinetic Energy Interceptor; the midcourse phase include Upgraded Early Warning Radars, Exo Atmospheric Kill Vehicle, Sea Based X Band Radar, and Standard Missile 3; the terminal phase include the Patriot Air and Missile Defense System, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) Battle Management Command, Control and Communication, Standard Missile 6, and THAAD Ground Based Radar. 33 Table of Contents Precision Engagement. The Company provides mission solutions across the entire precision engagement chain that are designed to address customers increasing need to operate jointly (across services and between allied forces), work in a new net centric paradigm, minimize collateral damage, and strike time sensitive targets. The Companys precision engagement systems include: F 15 and F/A 18 Active Electronically Scanned Array radars, Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile, Miniature Air Launched Decoy, Situation Awareness Data Link, UK Joint Effects Tactical Targeting System, Non Line of Sight Launch System and Precision Attack Missile, Joint Standoff Weapon, Paveway, Tactical Tomahawk, F/A 18 Radar Warning Receiver, and High Power Microwave. Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance. Utilizing its sensing, processing, and dissemination technologies, the Company provides integrated systems solutions for observing, locating, processing, deciding, and disseminating actionable information, thereby enabling network centric operations for decision makers. These abilities are crucial for war fighters to achieve information dominance throughout the entire battlespace. The Companys key ISR programs include: Global Hawk sensor suite, Distributed Common Ground System, National Polar orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite Systems, Future Combat Systems Ground Sensor Integrator, and numerous classified programs. Homeland Security. The Company continues to leverage the technologies and solutions it has developed for its traditional defense markets to provide solutions to homeland security customers. Recent efforts have focused on the exploitation of the Companys expertise in the collection and analysis of large amounts of data. The Company has been awarded programs in border security, most notably US VISIT, and in related areas. Mission Systems Integration Raytheon continues to grow and expand its Mission Systems Integration (MSI) initiative. The Company believes that its customers are increasingly seeking a Mission Systems Integrator for their programs and the Company is well positioned to expand its MSI work over the next several years. Examples of the Companys MSI success in 2005 include: Award of the DD(X) Phase IV prime contract; Successes in intelligence community classified Horizontal Integration opportunities whose aim is to integrate and link mission elements, multiple sources of intelligence, and ultimately all elements of the intelligence community; and Design and implementation of an RF identification solution to track land border entries and exits at multiple border ports for the US VISIT program. Customer Focus Raytheons customer focus is a critical part of its strategy underpinned by a focus on performance, relationships, and solutions. Performance means being able to meet customer commitments, and is ensured through strong processes, metrics, and oversight. Raytheon has a process architecture that spans its broad programs and pursuits. It consists of processes such as Integrated Product Development System (IPDS) which assures consistency of evaluation and execution at each gate in a program life cycle. These processes are linked to an array of front end and back end metrics. With this structure, Raytheon is able to track results and be alerted to potential issues through numerous oversight mechanisms, including operating reviews, annual operating plan reviews, and human resource reviews. Raytheon is continuing to build strong customer relationships by listening to customers, working with them as partners, and including them on Raytheon Six Sigma teams to jointly improve their programs and processes. Raytheon is increasingly focused on the importance of speed and agility in responding to its customers changing requirements. Recent examples of Raytheon teaming with its customers and delivering rapid, effective responses to real problems include: PSDS2, a surveillance system delivered to the U.S. Army in 6 months; RAID, elevated sensors first deployed to Afghanistan in 36 days; and MTS, an EO/IR system that became operational for combat use with Hellfire missiles in 4 months. Other Business Considerations The Company currently is involved in approximately 8,000 active programs and has 13,000 contracts. No individual contract exceeded 4% of Company sales in 2005. Management believes that the Companys diverse portfolio of programs and capabilities is well suited to a changing defense environment. Raytheon, however, faces numerous challenges and risks. 34 Table of Contents The Companys programs generally are implemented by the award of individual contracts and subcontracts and are subject to congressional appropriations. Congress generally appropriates funds on a fiscal year basis even though a program may extend for several years. Consequently, programs are often only partially funded initially, and additional funds are committed only as Congress makes further appropriations. U.S. government contracts and subcontracts under a program are subject to termination or adjustment if appropriations for such program are not available or change. U.S. government contracts are also subject to oversight audits and contain provisions for termination. Failure to comply with U.S. government regulations could lead to suspension or debarment from U.S. government contracting. Sales to the U.S. government may be affected by changes in procurement policies, budget considerations, changing defense requirements, and political developments. The influence of these factors, which are largely beyond the Companys control, could impact the Companys financial position or results of operations. In addition, the Companys programs typically involve the development, application, and manufacturing of advanced defense and technology systems and products aimed at achieving challenging goals. New technologies may be untested or unproven. In some instances, product requirements or specifications may be modified. As a result, the Company may experience technological and other performance difficulties, which may result in delays, setbacks, cost overruns, and product failures in connection with its programs. As a U.S. government contractor, the Company is subject to specific import and export, procurement and other regulations and requirements. Failure to comply with these regulations and requirements could result in reductions of the value of contracts, contract modifications or termination, and the assessment of penalties and fines and lead to suspension or debarment, for cause, from government contracting or subcontracting for a period of time. Among the causes for debarment are violations of various statutes, including those related to procurement integrity, export control, government security regulations, employment practices, the protection of the environment, the accuracy of records, and the recording of costs. Under many government contracts, the Company is required to maintain facility and personnel security clearances complying with DoD requirements. The Company is also subject to routine audits and investigations by U.S. government agencies such as the Defense Contract Audit Agency (DCAA). These agencies review a contractors performance under its contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards. The DCAA also reviews the adequacy of, and a contractors compliance with, its internal control systems and policies, including the contractors purchasing, property, estimating, compensation, and management information systems. Any costs found to be improperly allocated to a specific contract will not be reimbursed or must be refunded if already reimbursed. If an audit uncovers improper or illegal activities, the Company may be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, which could include: termination of contracts; forfeiture of profits; suspension of payments; fines; and suspension or prohibition from doing business with the U.S. government. FINANCIAL SUMMARY As discussed in more detail throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations: Gross bookings were $24.8 billion in 2005, $25.7 billion in 2004, and $22.7 billion in 2003, resulting in backlog of $34.4 billion, $32.5 billion, and $27.5 billion at December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Backlog represents future sales expected to be recognized over the next several years. Net sales were $21.9 billion in 2005, $20.2 billion in 2004, and $18.1 billion in 2003. The increase in sales was a result of strong growth at the Companys government and defense businesses, primarily Integrated Defense Systems and Missile Systems, as well as growth at Raytheon Aircraft. Operating income was $1.7 billion in 2005, $1.4 billion in 2004, and $1.3 billion in 2003. Operating income as a percent of net sales was 7.7%, 6.9%, and 7.3% in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Included in operating income was a FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment, described below in Consolidated Results of Operations, of $465 million in 2005, $474 million in 2004, and $109 million of expense in 2003. The FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment in 2006 is expected to be approximately $360 million of expense. Also included in operating income in 2003 were charges on certain programs at Network Centric Systems and Technical Services of $276 million. 35 Table of Contents Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $2.5 billion in 2005, $2.1 billion in 2004, and $2.6 billion in 2003. Total debt was $4.5 billion at December 31, 2005 versus $5.2 billion at December 31, 2004. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES The Companys consolidated financial statements are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles which requires the Company to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in its financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates, and any such differences may be material to the Companys financial statements. The Company believes that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than the Companys other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of its financial statements. The Company believes its judgments related to these accounting policies are appropriate. However, if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from the amounts recorded. Revenue Recognition Sales under long term contracts generally are recorded under the percentage of completion method. Incurred costs and estimated gross margins are recorded as sales when work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to the Companys estimates of total costs and contract value. Cost estimates include direct and indirect costs such as labor, materials, warranty, and overhead. Some contracts contain incentive provisions based upon performance in relation to established targets, which are included at estimated realizable value. Contract change orders and claims are included when they can be reliably estimated and realization is considered probable. Due to the long term nature of many of the Companys programs, developing estimates of total costs and contract value often requires significant judgment. Factors that must be considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include labor productivity and availability, the nature and complexity of the work to be performed, the impact of change orders, availability of materials, the impact of delayed performance, availability and timing of funding from the customer, award fee estimations, and the recoverability of claims. In 2005, 2004, and 2003, operating income as a percent of net sales for the government and defense businesses did not vary by more than 2.3%. A 2.3% change in operating income as a percent of net sales for the government and defense businesses in 2005 would change the Companys operating income by approximately $460 million. Lot Accounting The Company uses lot accounting for new commercial aircraft introductions at Raytheon Aircraft. Lot accounting involves selecting an initial lot size at the time a new aircraft begins to be delivered and measuring an average margin over the entire lot for each aircraft sold. The costs attributed to aircraft delivered are based on the estimated average margin of all aircraft in the lot and are determined under the learning curve concept, which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs from cost reduction initiatives and as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition. Once the initial lot has been completed, the use of lot accounting is discontinued. The selection of lot size is a critical judgment. The Company determines lot size based on several factors, including the size of firm backlog, market and competitive conditions, the expected annual production for the aircraft, and experience on similar new aircraft. The size of the initial lot for the Beechcraft Premier I is 200 units. The size of the initial lot for the Hawker 4000 is 75 units. A 5% increase in the remaining estimated costs to produce the initial lots of these two aircraft would reduce the Companys operating income by approximately $64 million in the aggregate. Valuation of Used Aircraft and Aircraft Materials and Parts The valuation of used aircraft in inventories, which are stated at cost, but not in excess of realizable value, requires significant judgment. The valuation of used aircraft is also considered in assessing the realizable value of certain commuter aircraft related assets which serve as collateral for the underlying financing arrangements. As part of the assessment of realizable value, the Company evaluates many factors including current market conditions, future market conditions, the age and condition of the aircraft, and availability levels for the aircraft in the market. A 5% decrease in the aggregate realizable value of used aircraft in inventory at December 31, 2005, would result in an impairment charge of approximately $10 million. The valuation of aircraft materials and parts that support the worldwide fleet of aircraft, which are stated at cost, but not in excess of realizable value, also requires significant judgment. As part of the assessment of realizable value, the Company evaluates many factors including the expected useful life of the aircraft, some of which have remained in service for up to 50 years. A 5% 36 Table of Contents decrease in the aggregate realizable value of aircraft materials and parts at December 31, 2005, would result in an impairment charge of approximately $5 million. The Company assumed an orderly disposition for both used aircraft and aircraft materials and parts in connection with the assessments of realizable value. Impairment of Goodwill and Long lived Assets The Company evaluates the recoverability of long lived assets upon indication of possible impairment by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the related estimated undiscounted cash flows. When an evaluation indicates that the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets, the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value. The determination of what constitutes an indication of possible impairment, the estimation of future cash flows, and the determination of estimated fair value are all significant judgments. In addition, the Company performs an annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year. The Company estimates the fair value of reporting units using a discounted cash flow model based on the Companys most recent five year plan and compares the estimated fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. Preparation of forecasts for use in the five year plan involves significant judgments. Changes in these forecasts could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of the Companys reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period; however, a 10% decrease in the current fair value of each of the Companys reporting units would not result in a goodwill impairment charge except at Flight Options. In 2005, the Company recorded a $22 million pretax, $19 million after tax, goodwill impairment charge at Flight Options, as described in Note A, Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Financial Statements. Pension Costs The Company has pension plans covering the majority of its employees, including certain employees in foreign countries. The selection of the assumptions used to determine pension expense or income involves significant judgment. The Companys long term return on asset (ROA) and discount rate assumptions are considered the key variables in determining pension expense or income. To develop the long term ROA assumption, the Company considered the current level of expected returns on risk free investments, the historical level of the risk premium associated with the other asset classes in which the Company has invested pension plan assets, and the expectations for future returns of each asset class. Since the Companys investment policy is to employ active management strategies in all asset classes, the potential exists to outperform the broader markets; therefore, the expected returns are higher than the broader markets. The expected return for each asset class was then weighted based upon an asset allocation within the Companys policy allocation ranges to develop the long term ROA assumption. The policy asset allocation ranges are between 50% and 75% equities with a 9.9% expected return, between 20% and 40% debt securities with a 6.2% expected return, between 2% and 7% real estate with an 8.2% expected return, and between 2% and 17% other (including private equity and cash) with a 7.0% expected return. The long term ROA assumption for the Companys domestic pension plans in 2006 is 8.75%, unchanged from 2005. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected ROA assumption would increase or decrease the Companys pension expense in 2006 by approximately $30 million. The discount rate assumption was determined by using a model consisting of theoretical bond portfolios that closely match the various durations of the Companys pension liability duration. The discount rate assumption for the Companys domestic pension plans in 2006 is 5.75%, unchanged from 2005. The Companys pension expense is expected to be approximately $810 million in 2006 and $723 million in 2007. For every 2.5% that the actual domestic pension plan asset return exceeds or is less than the long term ROA assumption for 2006, the Companys pension expense for 2007 would change by approximately $17 million. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption for 2007 would increase or decrease the Companys pension expense for 2007 by approximately $45 million. In addition, the Company has $5.1 billion of pension and $427 million of retiree medical deferred actuarial losses resulting from changes in discount rates, differences between actual and assumed asset returns, medical cost inflation and differences between actual and assumed demographic experience (actual earnings, rates of turnover and retirement). These losses are amortized and included in future pension and retiree medical expense over the average employee service period of approximately 12 years. Although they are included in the liabilities disclosed in Note N, Pension and Other Employee Benefits, of the Notes to the Financial Statements, they have not yet been recognized on the Companys balance sheet. Effective December 31, 2005, the Company updated its mortality assumption for its pension and post retirement benefit programs to a blend of the Companys own historical experience and a table representing broad expectations of U.S. mortality rates to reflect changes in the lifespan of the pension population. This assumption change results in an increase in 2006 pension expense of $130 million. 37 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net sales were $21.9 billion in 2005, $20.2 billion in 2004, and $18.1 billion in 2003. The increase in sales was due to higher U.S. government expenditures in the Companys government and defense businesses, as well as higher sales at RAC. Sales to the U.S. Department of Defense were 67% of sales in 2005 and 2004, and 65% in 2003. Total sales to the U.S. government, including foreign military sales, were 74% of sales in 2005, 2004, and 2003. Total international sales, including foreign military sales, were $4.2 billion or 19% of sales in 2005, $3.7 billion or 18% in 2004, and $3.5 billion or 19% in 2003. In general, international sales, excluding foreign military sales, have more favorable cash and profit terms than domestic sales. Gross margin (net sales less cost of sales) was $3.7 billion in 2005, $3.3 billion in 2004, and $3.1 billion in 2003, or 16.7% of sales in 2005, 16.1% in 2004, and 16.9% in 2003. Included in gross margin was a FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment, described below, of $465 million, $474 million, and $109 million of expense in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. The increase in the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment in 2004 was due primarily to the reduction in the Companys discount rate assumption under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS No. 87), and the actual rate of return on pension plan assets in 2000 and 2001. The decrease in gross margin as a percent of sales for 2004 was due to the increase in the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment. Included in gross margin for 2003 were charges of $237 million at Network Centric Systems and $39 million at Technical Services. The FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment represents the difference between the Companys pension expense or income under SFAS No. 87 and the Companys pension expense under Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) and is reported as a separate line item in the Companys segment results. SFAS No. 87 outlines the methodology used to determine pension expense or income for financial reporting purposes, which is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements of pension plans, which are determined by other factors. Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) proscribe the allocation to and recovery of pension costs on U.S. government contracts and is a major factor in determining pension funding requirements. The results for each segment only include pension expense as determined under CAS, which can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. Administrative and selling expenses were $1,474 million or 6.7% of sales in 2005, $1,385 million or 6.8% of sales in 2004, and $1,261 million or 7.0% of sales in 2003. Included in administrative and selling expenses in 2005 was a $22 million goodwill impairment charge related to Flight Options described below in Segment Results. Research and development expenses were $503 million or 2.3% of sales in 2005, $491 million or 2.4% of sales in 2004, and $487 million or 2.7% of sales in 2003. Operating income was $1,687 million or 7.7% of sales in 2005, $1,388 million or 6.9% of sales in 2004, and $1,316 million or 7.3% of sales in 2003. The changes in operating income by segment are described below in Segment Results. Interest expense was $312 million in 2005, $418 million in 2004, and $537 million in 2003. The decreases in interest expense in 2005 and 2004 were due to lower average debt for those years. Other (income) expense, net was $13 million of income in 2005, $436 million of expense in 2004, and $67 million of expense in 2003. Included in other income, net in 2005 was a $45 million gain on the sale of the Companys investment in Indra ATM S.L., a Spanish joint venture, partially offset by a $12 million charge related to the Companys proposed settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as described in Note L, Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Financial Statements and a $10 million charge related to the early redemption of debt. Included in other expense, net in 2004 was a $325 million charge related to the Companys settlement of a securities class action lawsuit described in Note L, Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Financial Statements and a $132 million charge related to the Companys repurchase of long term debt and subordinated notes payable. The effective tax rate was 34.6% in 2005, 24.2% in 2004, and 29.8% in 2003, reflecting the U.S. statutory rate of 35% reduced by ESOP dividend deductions, export related tax benefits, and research tax credits. Included in the effective tax rate in 2005 was the impact of the nondeductible $12 million proposed settlement with the SEC, the impact of the nondeductible portion of the $22 million Flight Options goodwill impairment charge, an $18 million accrual related to adjustments resulting from examinations by taxing authorities and other tax issues, and a $5 million accrual related to the repatriation of earnings from foreign subsidiaries. Included in the effective tax rate in 2004 was a $42 million benefit from 38 Table of Contents the change in tax law primarily related to the extension of the foreign tax credit carryforward periods from five to 10 years. At December 31, 2005, the Company estimates that it has utilized all of its net operating loss carryforwards. Income from continuing operations was $942 million or $2.08 per diluted share on 453.3 million average shares outstanding in 2005, $439 million or $0.99 per diluted share on 442.2 million average shares outstanding in 2004, and $535 million or $1.29 per diluted share on 415.4 million average shares outstanding in 2003. The increase in average shares outstanding in 2004 was due to common stock issued in connection with the Companys equity security units described below in Capital Structure and Resources. The increase in average shares outstanding in 2005 was due to the common stock issued in 2004 being outstanding for the full year. The loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, described below in Discontinued Operations, was $71 million or $0.16 per diluted share in 2005, $63 million or $0.14 per diluted share in 2004, and $170 million or $0.41 per diluted share in 2003. Effective January 1, 2004, the Company changed the measurement date for its pension and other postretirement benefit plans from October 31 to December 31. This change in measurement date was accounted for as a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was a gain of $53 million pretax for pension benefits and a gain of $10 million pretax for other postretirement benefits. Using the Companys year end as the measurement date for pension and other postretirement benefit plans more appropriately reflects the plans financial status for the years then ended. In 2004, the total cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle was a gain of $63 million pretax, $41 million after tax, or $0.09 per diluted share. Net income was $871 million or $1.92 per diluted share in 2005, $417 million or $0.94 per diluted share in 2004, and $365 million or $0.88 per diluted share in 2003. SEGMENT RESULTS Reportable segments have been determined based upon product lines and include the following: Integrated Defense Systems, Intelligence and Information Systems, Missile Systems, Network Centric Systems, Space and Airborne Systems, Technical Services, Aircraft, and Other. In 2005, certain programs within Intelligence and Information Systems, Network Centric Systems and Technical Services were realigned within those same segments. Information for all prior periods presented was reclassified to reflect these changes.

These increases were generally due to growth in U.S. defense spending. The Company currently expects these market trends to continue to positively impact the Companys sales in 2006. The Companys expectations are based on the Companys planning assumptions and projections and assessment of numerous factors, including macro environmental factors which are outside the Companys control. The Company believes the current market environment is generally consistent with the Companys planning assumptions and performance for the defense businesses, however, there are numerous factors which could materially impact the environment, including rising budget deficits, costs associated with current U.S. Department of Defense operations overseas, and other issues affecting the U.S. Department of Defense budget and may represent a risk to the Companys expected future performance. The Company expects that the Space and Airborne Systems operating margin for 2006 will be less than its margin in 2005 primarily due to the favorable margin impact of certain contracts nearing completion in 2005. The net sales for Aircraft increased in 2004 and 2005. The Company expects an increase in sales at Aircraft in 2006 but not at the same growth rate as that experienced in 2005 due to higher volume from derivative aircraft introductions in 2005 and market demand for Beechcraft and Hawker products in 2006 that is increasing at a rate lower than 2005. Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) IDS provides integrated air defense, maritime, and joint battlespace solutions. IDS had 2005 sales of $3.8 billion versus $3.5 billion in 2004 and $2.9 billion in 2003. The increase in sales in 2005 was due to growth on international programs and the Cobra Judy Replacement Mission Equipment program. The increase in sales in 2004 was due to continued growth on DD(X), the Navys future destroyer program. Operating income was $548 million in 2005, versus $417 million in 2004 and $331 million in 2003. The increase in operating margin in 2005 was due to higher sales on international programs. 40 Table of Contents Intelligence and Information Systems (IIS) IIS provides systems, subsystems, and software engineering services for national and tactical intelligence systems, as well as for homeland security and information technology solutions. IIS had 2005 sales of $2.5 billion versus $2.3 billion in 2004 and $2.2 billion in 2003. The increase in sales in 2005 was due to growth in classified programs. The increase in sales in 2004 was due to growth in the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) program and growth in classified programs. Operating income was $229 million in 2005, versus $203 million in 2004 and $198 million in 2003. Missile Systems (MS) MS provides air to air, precision strike, surface Navy air defense, and land combat missiles, guided projectiles, kinetic kill vehicles, and directed energy weapons. MS had 2005 sales of $4.1 billion versus $3.8 billion in 2004 and $3.5 billion in 2003. The increase in sales in 2005 was due primarily to the ramp up on Tactical Tomahawk and several developmental programs. The increase in sales in 2004 was due to continued growth in missile defense, including work on the Standard Missile 3 program. Operating income was $431 million in 2005 versus $436 million in 2004 and $424 million in 2003. The decline in operating margin in 2005 and 2004 was due to the wind down of cost recovery for prior year restructuring actions. The costs related to these restructuring actions were accrued in 1997 through 2000, but were being recovered through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government over a five year period. The wind down of this recovery was substantially completed in 2004. Network Centric Systems (NCS) NCS develops and produces net centric mission solutions for network sensors, command and control communications, air traffic management, and homeland security. NCS had 2005 sales of $3.2 billion versus $3.1 billion in 2004 and $2.7 billion in 2003. The increase in sales in 2005 was due to growth in developmental and communications programs. Operating income was $333 million in 2005 versus $269 million in 2004 and $13 million in 2003. The increase in operating margin in 2005 was due to improved performance and program mix. Included in 2003 were charges resulting in a reduction in sales and operating income of $228 million and $237 million, respectively, related to performance issues on certain NCS programs. Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) SAS designs and develops integrated systems and solutions for advanced missions including unmanned aerial operations, electronic warfare, active electronically scanned array radars, airborne processors, weapon grade lasers, missile defense, and intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance systems. SAS had 2005 sales of $4.2 billion, versus $4.1 billion in 2004 and $3.7 billion in 2003. Operating income was $606 million in 2005 versus $568 million in 2004 and $492 million in 2003. The increase in operating margin in 2005 was due to prior year charges on an international program of $55 million as a result of a qualification test failure, and productivity improvements on mature production programs, partially offset by cost growth on development programs. Operating margin was higher in 2004 due primarily to productivity improvements on production programs, partially offset by prior year charges. Technical Services (RTSC) RTSC provides technology solutions for defense, federal government and commercial customers worldwide, specializing in counter proliferation and counter terrorism, base and range operations, customized engineering and manufacturing services, and mission support. RTSC had 2005 sales of $2.0 billion versus $2.0 billion in 2004 and $1.9 billion in 2003. Operating income was $146 million in 2005, versus $148 million in 2004 and $109 million in 2003. Included in 2003 operating income were charges of $39 million related to an unfavorable change in the scope on a long term contract of $22 million and a provision for the collectibility of certain unbilled costs of $17 million. Raytheon Aircraft Company (RAC) RAC designs, develops, manufactures, markets, and provides global support for business jets, turboprops, and piston powered aircraft for the worlds commercial, fractional ownership, and military aircraft markets. RAC had 2005 sales of $2.9 billion versus $2.4 billion in 2004 and $2.1 billion in 2003. The increase in sales in 2005 was due to higher new commercial and special mission aircraft sales. The increase in sales in 2004 was primarily due to higher new aircraft sales. Operating income was $142 million in 2005, versus $63 million in 2004 and $2 million in 2003. The increase in operating income in 2005 was due to commercial and special mission volume and sales mix, and continued improved operating performance. The increase in operating income in 2004 was due to higher volume on new aircraft sales as well as productivity and cost savings initiatives implemented throughout 2003 and 2004. Included in 2005 and 2004 operating income was a $31 million and a $34 million, respectively, favorable profit adjustments on the military training aircraft programs. Included in 2003 operating income was a $50 million favorable 41 Table of Contents profit adjustment on the military training aircraft programs partially offset by a $22 million charge on the Premier program reflecting cost estimate increases. The favorable profit adjustments on the military training aircraft programs were due to option exercises and productivity improvements. Since the last contract option related to the military training aircraft programs was exercised in 2005, no favorable profit adjustment is expected in 2006. The Company expects to be awarded a new multiyear military training aircraft production contract in 2006. The Company has made significant investments in its Premier and Hawker 4000 aircrafts, the realization of which is contingent upon future sales at forecasted prices and reductions in production costs on future deliveries. The Company uses lot accounting for new commercial aircraft introductions. The size of the initial lot for the Premier I and the Hawker 4000 is 200 and 75 units, respectively, and the Company expects to complete the lots in 2007 and 2009, respectively. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the Federal Aviation Administration granted a provisional type certification for the Hawker 4000 aircraft. Final certification has not been received and no revenue has been recognized on this aircraft. Other The Other segment, which is comprised of Flight Options LLC (FO), Raytheon Airline Aviation Services LLC (RAAS), and Raytheon Professional Services LLC (RPS) had 2005 sales of $781 million versus $675 million in 2004 and $573 million in 2003. FO offers services in the aircraft fractional ownership industry. RAAS manages the long term wind down of the Companys commuter aircraft business. RPS works with customers to design and execute learning solutions. The increase in sales in 2004 was primarily due to the consolidation of FO in June 2003. The Other segment had an operating loss of $117 million in 2005 versus $40 million in 2004 and $34 million in 2003. The increase in operating loss in 2005 was primarily due to the operating results of FO described below, and to a lesser extent RAAS. The higher losses at RAAS were due to higher aircraft maintenance expense in the period. The Other segments results in 2005 were principally comprised of the operations of FO. Although FO has had a history of operating losses, the higher losses in 2005 are due to increased supplemental lift (higher third party chartering expense) and maintenance expense related to the operational impacts primarily from older aircraft in the fleet, and the timing of peak customer demand. The older aircraft in the fleet are being retired and replaced by newer aircraft which is expected to be substantially complete by 2008. At the same time, FO is also taking action to reduce the number of different types of aircraft in its fleet from twelve to four and in connection with this action reduce current operating costs. Although the Company believes that these actions will result in improved financial results, there can be no assurance that these actions will have the expected effect. In addition, in 2005, the Company recorded a $22 million pretax, $19 million after tax goodwill impairment charge related to FO. The impairment was a result of changes in valuation assumptions, the effect of projecting recent performance variances on future periods, and the increase in goodwill as a result of the transaction described below. The Company also recorded a $7 million charge in 2005 related to a third party settlement of a lawsuit against FO and its minority shareholders. In December 2005, the Company settled all disputes with the FO minority shareholders and acquired the minority shares for $28 million in cash and assumed liabilities and now owns 100% of FO. The Companys net investment in FO was approximately $223 million at December 31, 2005. If losses at FO were to continue over the longer term or if FOs financial objectives were no longer expected to be achieved, the Companys investment in FO could become further impaired and additional charges may be required. FO must demonstrate substantial operating results improvement to achieve its financial objectives including achieving its sales forecasts, reducing maintenance expense, and improving dispatch availability over the 2005 average. RAAS has exposure to outstanding financing arrangements for commuter aircraft, with the aircraft serving as collateral for these arrangements. Commuter aircraft customers of RAAS are generally thinly capitalized companies whose financial condition could be significantly affected by sustained higher fuel costs, industry consolidation, and declining commercial aviation market conditions. At December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, the Companys exposure on commuter aircraft assets was approximately $509 million relating to 253 aircraft and approximately $614 million relating to 297 aircraft, respectively. The carrying value of commuter aircraft assets assumes an orderly disposition of these assets. If the Company were to dispose of these assets in an other than orderly disposition, or sell the business in its entirety, the value realized would likely be reduced. 42 Table of Contents Backlog at December 31 (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Integrated Defense Systems $ 8,010 $ 6,628 $ 6,526 Intelligence and Information Systems 4,077 4,066 4,100 Missile Systems 8,040 8,341 5,028 Network Centric Systems 4,307 3,587 3,167 Space and Airborne Systems 5,220 5,216 4,865 Technical Services 1,594 1,773 1,401 Aircraft 2,891 2,638 2,279 Other 280 294 176 Total $ 34,419 $ 32,543 $ 27,542 U.S. government backlog included above $ 27,171 $ 25,525 $ 21,353 Funded Backlog at December 31 (In millions) 2005 2004 2003 Integrated Defense Systems $ 3,009 $ 3,454 $ 3,318 Intelligence and Information Systems 642 811 717 Missile Systems 4,443 4,517 4,069 Network Centric Systems 2,839 2,623 2,396 Space and Airborne Systems 2,851 3,127 3,801 Technical Services 916 939 888 Aircraft 2,600 2,638 2,279 Other 280 294 176 Total $ 17,580 $ 18,403 $ 17,644 Funded backlog excludes U.S. and foreign government contracts for which funding has not been appropriated.

For example, in 2005, Integrated Defense Systems booked $1.7 billion to continue the ship system integration and detail design for the U.S. Navys DD(X) Destroyer and $631 million to provide Taiwan with an Early Warning Surveillance Radar System. In 2005, SAS booked $586 million for the production of 190 APG 79 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars for the F/A 18 Super Hornet program. In 2004, SAS booked over $1.3 billion on a number of classified contracts. In 2004, Missile Systems booked $2.1 billion for the Kinetic Energy Interceptor system contract. In 2005, Raytheon Aircraft received an order for approximately $1 billion for 50 new Hawker 4000 super midsize business jets to be delivered through 2015 and a guaranteed maintenance program which runs for ten years from the delivery of each aircraft. 43 Table of Contents DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS In 2000, the Company sold its Raytheon Engineers & Constructors businesses (RE&C) to Washington Group International, Inc. (WGI). As a result of WGIs bankruptcy, the Company was required to perform various contract and lease obligations under letters of credit, surety bonds, and guarantees (Support Agreements) that it had provided to project owners and other parties. The Company has settled many of its Support Agreement obligations. For its remaining Support Agreement obligations, the Company has various risks and exposures, including warranty close out, various liquidated damages issues, and potential adverse claims resolution. The Company is currently engaged in a dispute with AES Red Oak LLS (AES) over the close out of the Red Oak Power project. The dispute involves, among other things, a draw down of $30 million by AES in August 2004 from a line of credit provided by the Company. In 2005, 2004, and 2003, the pretax loss from discontinued operations related to RE&C was $41 million, $42 million, and $231 million, respectively. In 2005 and 2004, the Company recorded after tax charges of $23 million and $24 million, respectively, for an estimated liability for foreign tax related matters. Although not expected to be material, additional losses on foreign tax related matters could be recorded in the future as estimates are revised or the underlying matters are settled. Included in 2003 were charges of $176 million related to the completion of the Mystic Station and Fore River construction projects in Massachusetts. The after tax loss from discontinued operations related to RE&C was $50 million, $48 million, and $151 million in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. Net cash used in operating activities from discontinued operations related to RE&C was $25 million in 2005 versus $61 million in 2004 and $513 million in 2003. In 2002, the Company sold its Aircraft Integration Systems business (AIS) for $1,123 million, net, subject to purchase price adjustments. As part of the transaction, the Company retained the responsibility for performance of the Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) program and retained certain assets related to the BBJ program, which is now essentially complete. In January 2006, a dispute regarding the AIS purchase price was resolved in arbitration and the Company recorded a pretax charge of $26 million in 2005 related to this settlement. In 2005, 2004, and 2003, the pretax loss from discontinued operations related to AIS was $33 million, $23 million, and $30 million, respectively, primarily related to the completion of the BBJ program and the resolution of the purchase price dispute. In 2005, the total loss from discontinued operations was $74 million pretax, $71 million after tax, or $0.16 per diluted share versus $65 million pretax, $63 million after tax or $0.14 per diluted share in 2004 and $261 million pretax, $170 million after tax, or $0.41 per diluted share in 2003. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY The Company is currently employing a capital deployment plan, announced in December 2004, that balances funding for growing the Companys business, debt reductions, pension contributions, dividend payments, and stock repurchases. The Company is also focused on increasing Return On Invested Capital (ROIC) as well as continued strong cash generation in 2006. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities in 2005 was $2,515 million versus $2,071 million in 2004 and $2,034 million in 2003. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $2,546 million in 2005, $2,114 million in 2004 and $2,567 million in 2003. Included in 2004 was a $210 million payment made in connection with the settlement of the securities class action lawsuit as discussed in Note L, Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Financial Statements. The Company received approximately $75 million of insurance proceeds related to this lawsuit in 2005. Total net cash tax payments were approximately $56 million, $5 million and $13 million in 2005, 2004, and 2003, respectively. Tax payments in 2006 are expected to approximate $360 million. 44 Table of Contents Total contributions (required and discretionary) to the Companys pension plans are expected to be approximately $640 million in 2006. Congress is currently considering pension funding reform legislation which would increase funding requirements for most companies sponsoring defined benefit pension plans. If enacted, the pension funding reform legislation could result in an increase in the Companys pension contribution requirement beginning in 2006. Savings and investment plan activity includes certain items related to the Companys 401(k) plan that were funded through the issuance of the Companys common stock and are non cash operating activities included on the 2004 and 2003 statement of cash flows. In 2004, the Company began funding its 401(k) plan match with cash. Although not expected to be material, due to potential noncompliance by certain suppliers with DoD procurement requirements, the Company has experienced delays in deliveries and collections and has not billed customers for certain portions of products as the Company and other industry participants work to resolve this matter with the DoD. The Company provides long term financing to its aircraft customers. Origination of financing receivables was $315 million in 2005, $325 million in 2004, and $402 million in 2003. Collection of financing receivables not sold was $411 million in 2005, $459 million in 2004, and $588 million in 2003. The Company received proceeds of $23 million in 2005, $59 million in 2004 and $279 million in 2003 related to the sale of certain general aviation finance receivables, described below in Off Balance Sheet Arrangements. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $436 million in 2005 versus $532 million in 2004 and $708 million in 2003. Capital expenditures were $338 million in 2005, $363 million in 2004, and $428 million in 2003. Capital expenditures in 2006 are expected to approximate $400 million. Capitalized expenditures for internal use software were $75 million in 2005, $103 million in 2004, and $98 million in 2003. Capitalized expenditures for internal use software in 2006 are expected to approximate $100 million. In 2003, the Company bought back the assets remaining in a synthetic lease facility for $125 million. Proceeds from the sale of operating units and investments were $78 million in 2005 versus $47 million in 2004 and $111 million in 2003. In 2005, the Company sold its investment in Indra ATM S.L., a Spanish joint venture, for $59 million. In 2004, the Company sold its commercial infrared business for $43 million. In 2003, the Company sold the remaining interest in its former aviation support business for $97 million. In 2005, the Company paid the third and final installment of $60 million related to its 2003 acquisition of Solipsys Corporation. Also in 2005, the Company paid $39 million for the acquisition of UTD, Inc. and $26 million to acquire the remaining interest in Flight Options. In 2003 and 2004, the Company paid $40 million and $70 million, respectively related to the acquisition of Solipsys Corporation. Also in 2004, the Company paid $42 million for the acquisition of Photon Research Associates, Inc. In 2003, the Company paid $130 million related to the Space Imaging credit facility guarantee, described below in Major Affiliated Entities. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $1,433 million in 2005 versus $1,644 million in 2004 and $1,209 million in 2003. Dividends paid to stockholders were $387 million in 2005, $349 million in 2004, and $331 million in 2003. The quarterly dividend rate was $0.22 per share for each of the four quarters of 2005 versus $0.20 per share for each of the four quarters of 2004 and 2003. Although the Company does not have a formal dividend policy, management believes that a reasonable dividend payout ratio based on the current industry environment and market conditions is approximately one third of the Companys economic earnings (income excluding FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment). Dividends are subject to approval by the Board of Directors. In 2004, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006, of up to $700 million of the Companys outstanding common stock. In 2005, the Company repurchased $436 million of common stock under this program. 45 Table of Contents CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND RESOURCES Total debt was $4.5 billion at December 31, 2005 and $5.2 billion at December 31, 2004. Cash and cash equivalents were $1.2 billion at December 31, 2005 and $556 million at December 31, 2004. At December 31, 2005, the cash and cash equivalent balance included approximately $150 million of cash held in foreign subsidiaries. The Companys outstanding debt has interest rates ranging from 4.5% to 8.3% and matures at various dates through 2028. Total debt as a percentage of total capital was 29.4% and 32.8% at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The Company has approximately $400 million of subordinated notes payable that is scheduled to mature in 2006. In 2005, the Company exercised its call rights to repurchase long term debt with a par value of $196 million at a loss of $10 million pretax. In 2004, the Company repurchased long term debt and subordinated notes payable with a par value of $2,254 million at a loss of $132 million pretax. In 2003, the Company issued $425 million of long term debt and used the proceeds to reduce the amounts outstanding under the Companys lines of credit. Also in 2003, the Company issued $500 million of fixed rate long term debt and $200 million of floating rate notes and used the proceeds to partially fund the repurchase of long term debt with a par value of $924 million at a loss of $77 million pre tax. In March 2005, the Company entered into a $2.2 billion bank revolving credit facility which replaced its previous $2.3 billion revolving credit facilities. Under the current credit facility, the Company can draw down on lines of credit and use the credit facility to support commercial paper or letters of credit that the Company may issue for short term liquidity. The credit facility matures in March 2010. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest based on LIBOR. As of December 31, 2005 and December 31, 2004, there were no borrowings under the current credit facility and the previous credit facilities, respectively; however, the Company had approximately $100 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2005 and 2004, which effectively reduced the Companys borrowing capacity under the current credit facility and the previous credit facilities by such amount at such dates. Under its current credit facility, the Company must comply with certain covenants, including the ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no more than 50% and the ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) to consolidated net interest expense, for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, of no less than 3.0 to 1.0. The Company was in compliance with the covenants during the period in 2005 in which such credit facility was in place and expects to continue to be in compliance throughout 2006. Certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company maintain revolving bank lines of credit to provide them with a limited amount of short term liquidity. In 2005, Raytheon United Kingdom Limited, a U.K. subsidiary, entered into a $150 million committed multicurrency revolving credit facility which replaced its previous uncommitted bank lines totaling $84 million. There was $53 million of outstanding borrowings under the facility at December 31, 2005. There were no outstanding borrowings under the bank lines at December 31, 2004. In addition, other uncommitted bank lines totaled $6 million and $7 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. There were no amounts outstanding under these lines of credit at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Compensating balance arrangements are not material. The Company enters into various interest rate swaps that correspond to a portion of the Companys fixed rate debt in order to effectively hedge interest rate risk. The $600 million notional value of interest rate swaps that remained outstanding at December 31, 2005 effectively converted that portion of the Companys total fixed rate debt to variable rate debt based on LIBOR. Credit ratings for the Company were assigned by Fitchs at F2 for short term borrowing and BBB for senior debt, by Moodys at P 3 for short term borrowing and Baa3 for senior debt, and by Standard and Poors at A 2 for short term borrowing and BBB for senior debt. In 2004, in accordance with the terms of the 8.25%, $50 par value equity security units it issued in 2001, the Company issued 27.0 million shares of common stock and received proceeds of $863 million. 46 Table of Contents The Company has on file a shelf registration with the Securities and Exchange Commission for the issuance of up to $3.0 billion in debt securities, common or preferred stock, warrants to purchase any of the aforementioned securities, and or stock purchase contracts, under which $1.3 billion remained outstanding at December 31, 2005. The Company expects to use a portion of the remaining availability under the shelf registration in connection with the issuance of common stock warrants in its settlement of the securities class action lawsuit, described in Note L, Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Financial Statements. In 2004, the Company entered into an agreement to sell certain general aviation finance receivables, with the buyer assuming all servicing responsibilities. As part of the agreement, the Company retained a first loss deficiency guarantee of 7.5% of the receivable amount sold. In 2005 and 2004, the Company sold $5 million and $37 million, respectively, of receivables under the agreement, with no associated gain or loss. Also in 2005 and 2004, the Company separately sold $18 million and $22 million, respectively, of general aviation finance receivables without any continuing involvement. The Companys need for, cost of, and access to funds are dependent on future operating results, as well as conditions external to the Company. The Company expects that cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, proceeds from divestitures, and other available financing resources will be sufficient to meet anticipated operating, capital expenditure, and debt service requirements during the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future. In addition, the Company may, from time to time, utilize excess cash balances to repurchase debt or common stock as warranted by market conditions. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS The Company has entered into off balance sheet arrangements, including the sale of general aviation receivables. The Companys off balance sheet arrangements are not material to its overall liquidity or capital resources, market risk support or credit risk support. The Company also issues guarantees to third parties related to affiliates as described below in Commitments and Contingencies. In 2003, the Company sold $337 million of general aviation finance receivables to a qualifying special purpose entity which in turn issued beneficial interests in these receivables to a commercial paper conduit, and retained a subordinated interest in and servicing rights to the receivables. The Company received proceeds of $279 million and recognized a gain of $2 million. The sale was non recourse to the Company due to third party financial guarantees, and effectively reduced the Companys exposure to general aviation market risk for receivables by approximately 25%. At December 31, 2005 and 2004, the outstanding balance of securitized accounts receivable held by the third party conduit totaled $157 million and $204 million, respectively, of which the Companys subordinated retained interest was $59 million and $58 million, respectively, net, and the fair value of the servicing asset was $2 million and $4 million, respectively. In 1997, the Company provided a first loss guarantee of $133 million on $1.3 billion of U.S. Export Import Bank loans (maturing in 2015) to the Brazilian government related to the System for the Vigilance of the Amazon (SIVAM) program being performed by the Companys Network Centric Systems segment. The first interest payment became due and was paid in 2005. MAJOR AFFILIATED ENTITIES Investments, which are included in other assets, consisted of the following at December 31: (In millions) 2005 Ownership % 2005 2004 Equity method investments: Thales Raytheon Systems Co. Ltd. 50.0 $ 102 $ 87 HRL Laboratories, LLC 33.3 31 30 Indra ATM S.L. 12 TelASIC Communications 17.1 3 Other n/a 6 7 139 139 Other investments 7 10 Total $ 146 $ 149 47 Table of Contents In 2001, the Company formed a joint venture, Thales Raytheon Systems (TRS), that has two major operating subsidiaries, one of which the Company controls and consolidates. TRS is a system of systems integrator and provides fully customized solutions through the integration of command and control centers, radars, and communication networks. HRL Laboratories is a scientific research facility whose staff engages in the areas of space and defense technologies. TelASIC Communications delivers high performance, cost effective radio frequency (RF), analog mixed signal, and digital solutions for both the commercial and defense electronics markets. In 1995, through the acquisition of E Systems, Inc., the Company invested in Space Imaging and had a 31% equity investment in Space Imaging LLC. In the first quarter of 2003, the Company paid $130 million related to a Space Imaging credit facility that matured in March 2003 for which the Company had guaranteed and accrued for in a prior year. In exchange for this payment, the Company received a note from Space Imaging for this amount that the Company has valued at zero. In January 2006, substantially all of the assets of Space Imaging were sold. The Company received total proceeds of approximately $25 million which will be recorded as other income. In 2005, the Company sold its investment in Indra ATM S.L., a Spanish joint venture for $59 million and recorded a gain of $45 million in other income, net. In addition, the Company has entered into joint ventures formed specifically to facilitate a teaming arrangement between two contractors for the benefit of the customer, generally the U.S. government, whereby the Company receives a subcontract from the joint venture in the joint ventures capacity as prime contractor. Accordingly, the Company records the work it performs for the joint venture as operating activity. Joint ventures are not subject to the Companys internal control structure. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES The Company is involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to remediation of various environmental sites. The Companys estimate of total environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred is $117 million. Discounted at a weighted average risk free rate of 5.8%, the Company estimates the liability to be $92 million before U.S. government recovery and had this amount accrued at December 31, 2005. A portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. The recovery of environmental cleanup costs from the U.S. government is considered probable based on government contracting regulations and the Companys long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs. Accordingly, the Company has recorded $51 million at December 31, 2005 for the estimated future recovery of these costs from the U.S. government, which is included in contracts in process. The Company leases certain government owned properties and is generally not liable for environmental remediation at these sites; therefore, no provision has been made in the financial statements for these costs. Due to the complexity of environmental laws and regulations, the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup methods and technologies, the uncertainty of insurance coverage, and the unresolved extent of the Companys responsibility, it is difficult to determine the ultimate outcome of these matters, however, any additional liability is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. The Company issues guarantees and has banks and surety companies issue, on its behalf, letters of credit and surety bonds to meet various bid, performance, warranty, retention and advance payment obligations of the Company or its affiliates. Approximately $312 million, $767 million, and $78 million of these guarantees, letters of credit, and surety bonds, for which there were stated values, were outstanding at December 31, 2005, respectively, and $294 million, $827 million, and $250 million were outstanding at December 31, 2004, respectively. These instruments expire on various dates through 2015. Included in guarantees and letters of credit above was $76 million and $183 million at December 31, 2005, respectively and $43 million and $153 million at December 31, 2004, respectively related to the Companys joint venture in Thales Raytheon Systems (TRS). Also, included in guarantees, letters of credit, and surety bonds above was $94 million, $8 million, and $62 million at December 31, 2005, respectively and $94 million, $9 million, and $234 million at December 31, 2004, respectively related to discontinued operations. Additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no stated value also remain outstanding. 48 Table of Contents The Company provides these guarantees and letters of credit to TRS and other affiliates to assist these entities in connection with obtaining financing on more favorable terms, making bids on contracts, and performing their contractual obligations. While the Company expects these entities to satisfy their loans, project performance, and other contractual obligations, their failure to do so may result in a future obligation for the Company. In connection with the order for 50 Hawker 4000 aircraft received by RAC in 2005, which is subject to the negotiation and execution of a mutually agreeable parent guarantee, RAC will be subject to liquidated damages of approximately $80 million if it fails to deliver at least 30 aircraft in accordance with the terms of the agreement. Under the agreement, RAC is also providing a guaranteed maintenance program which runs for ten years from the delivery date of each Hawker 4000 aircraft and provides for a guaranteed cost of maintenance, subject to annual CPI and other adjustments, for each aircraft. RAC is responsible for any costs that exceed the guaranteed cost of maintenance. The customers of FO, in certain instances, have the contractual ability to require FO to buy back their fractional share based on its current fair market value. The estimated value of this potential obligation was $575 million and $572 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Defense contractors are subject to many levels of audit and investigation. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Department of Defense Inspector General, the Government Accountability Office, the Department of Justice, and Congressional Committees. The Department of Justice, from time to time, has convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by the Company. Individually and in the aggregate, these investigations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. Raytheon Aircraft is also subject to oversight by the Federal Aviation Administration (the FAA). The FAA routinely evaluates aircraft operational and safety requirements and is responsible for certification of new and modified aircraft. Future action by the FAA may adversely affect Raytheon Aircrafts financial position, results of operations, and liquidity, including recovery of its investment in its newer aircraft. The following is a schedule of the Companys contractual obligations outstanding at December 31, 2005: (In millions) Total Less than 1 Year 13 years 45 years After 5 years Debt $ 4,096 $ 79 $ 995 $ 731 $ 2,291 Subordinated notes payable 382 382 Interest payments 2,190 268 466 360 1,096 Operating leases 1,205 318 441 234 212 Purchase obligations 7,654 5,421 1,683 426 124 Total $ 15,527 $ 6,468 $ 3,585 $ 1,751 $ 3,723 Interest payments include interest on debt that is redeemable at the option of the Company. The Company currently estimates that required pension plan cash contributions will be approximately $440 million in 2006. The Company made a discretionary cash contribution of $200 million in January 2006. The estimate for 2006 is subject to change and will not be known with certainty until the status of pension funding reform legislation is finalized in 2006. Estimates for 2007 and beyond have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts, which are subject to change with respect to future interest rates, asset returns and pension funding reform. In addition, pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government, therefore, the amounts noted above are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions will have on the Companys liquidity. Purchase obligations in the table above represent agreements with suppliers to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding. The Company enters into contracts with customers, primarily the U.S. government, which entitles the Company to full recourse for costs incurred, including purchase obligations, in the event the contract is terminated by the customer for convenience. These purchase obligations are included above notwithstanding the Companys full recourse. 49 Table of Contents ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2004, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payments (SFAS No. 123R). SFAS No. 123R requires the recognition of compensation expense related to stock options under SFAS No. 123, Accounting for Stock Based Compensation. In April 2005, the effective date for this accounting standard was deferred until the first annual period beginning after June 15, 2005. The Company expects to adopt SFAS No. 123R prospectively in the first quarter of 2006 with an anticipated impact to earnings per share of less than $0.02 per share for the year 2006. In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 151, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4, Inventory Costs (SFAS No. 151). This accounting standard, which is effective for annual periods beginning after June 15, 2005, requires that abnormal amounts of idle facility expense, freight, handling costs, and wasted materials (spoilage) should be recognized as current period charges. The adoption of SFAS No. 151 is not expected to have a material effect on the Companys financial position, results of operations, or liquidity. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK The Companys primary market exposures are to interest rates and foreign exchange rates. The Company meets its working capital requirements with a combination of variable rate short term and fixed rate long term financing. The Company enters into interest rate swap agreements with commercial and investment banks to manage interest rates associated with the Companys financing arrangements. The Company also enters into foreign currency forward contracts with commercial banks to fix the dollar value of commitments and payments to international vendors and the value of foreign currency denominated receipts. The market risk sensitive instruments used by the Company for hedging are entered into with commercial and investment banks and are directly related to a particular asset, liability, or transaction for which a firm commitment is in place. Financial instruments held by the Company which are subject to interest rate risk include notes payable, long term debt, long term receivables, investments, and interest rate swap agreements. The aggregate hypothetical loss in earnings for one year of those financial instruments held by the Company at December 31, 2005 and 2004, which are subject to interest rate risk resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 10%, was approximately $2 million and $1 million after tax for the year ended December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Fixed rate financial instruments were not evaluated, as the risk exposure is not material. The Company believes its exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates is not material due to the Companys hedging policy and the fact that the Company does not enter into speculative hedges. 50 Table of Contents
