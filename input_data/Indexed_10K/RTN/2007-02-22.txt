ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Introduction Raytheon Company, together with its subsidiaries, is one of the worlds largest defense contractors, serving all branches of the U.S. military and other U.S. government agencies, the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and many allied governments on every continent. We develop and provide technologically advanced, integrated products, services and solutions in our core defense markets: Sensing, including radars and radio frequency systems and infrared and electro optical sensors and systems; Command, Control, Communication and Intelligence (C3I), including tactical communication, command & control and intelligence systems; Effects, including missiles, precision weapons and information operations; and Mission Support, including full life cycle services and training. We operate in six principal business segments: Integrated Defense Systems (IDS), Intelligence and Information Systems (IIS), Missile Systems (MS), Network Centric Systems (NCS), Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) and Technical Services (TS). As discussed in more detail below and elsewhere in this Form 10 K, in December 2006, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our wholly owned subsidiary, Raytheon Aircraft Company. Accordingly, Raytheon Aircraft is presented as discontinued operations in this Form 10 K and, unless otherwise indicated, is not included in the discussion below, which pertains to our continuing operations. For further information regarding Raytheon Aircraft and our discontinued operations, see Note 2: Discontinued Operations within Item 8 of this Form 10 K. For a more detailed description of our segments, see Business Segments within Item 1 of this Form 10 K. In this section, we discuss our industry and how certain factors may affect our business, our key strategic imperatives and opportunities that will drive our business, how our financial performance is assessed and measured by management, and other business considerations, including certain risks and challenges to our business. Next, we discuss our critical accounting policies, which are those policies that are most important to both the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult or subjective judgment. We then review our 2006 results of operations beginning with an overview of our total company results, followed by a more detailed review of those results by business segment and discontinued operations. We also review our financial condition and liquidity including our capital structure and resources, off balance sheet arrangements, commitments and contingencies, and conclude with a discussion of our exposure to various market risks. Industry Considerations The Global War on Terrorism, Operation Enduring Freedom and Operation Iraqi Freedom have altered the global defense and security environment and have had, and for the foreseeable future are likely to continue to have, a significant impact on the markets for defense and advanced technology systems and products. The U.S. Department of Defense (the DoD) continues to focus on both supporting ongoing operations in Afghanistan and Iraq and transforming the U.S. military to confront future threats. In addition, the Office of Homeland Security and other U.S. government agencies continue to focus on enhancing the security of our homeland. Overall U.S. defense spending has increased in recent years in connection with the ongoing operations and the need to transform our force structure to address future threat scenarios. While the future direction of ongoing operations remains unsettled, we believe that the 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review, a comprehensive report issued by the DoD every four years on defense strategy, force structure, force modernization plans, infrastructure, budget plans and other elements of the U.S. defense programs and policies (the QDR), will continue to drive strategic thinking and budget priorities for the near term. The QDR recommended certain changes to force structure, particularly with respect to special operations forces, relating to the Global War on Terrorism and the insurgency in Iraq. However, at the same time, the QDR also largely maintained the DoDs transformation initiatives that we have supported over the last several years. Specifically, the QDR sets forth the following transformation priorities for which we are a key contributor: Continued broad emphasis on net centricity and net enabled weapon systems, with our Distributed Common Ground System providing the network centric operations backbone for the U.S. armed forces for their intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems; 31 Table of Contents Continued development of the U.S. Armys Future Combat Systems, which we support through our Ground Sensor Integrator (GSI), Battle Command Management and Execution, and Non Line of Sight Launch System solutions; Continued production of DDG 1000 Zumwalt Class Destroyer, the U.S. Navys next generation surface combatant, for which we are the prime mission systems equipment integrator for all electronic and combat systems; and Acceleration of the deployment of Global Hawk and Predator unmanned aerial vehicles, both of which carry our payloads and systems. The Presidents fiscal year 2008 budget and Future Years Defense Plan (the FYDP), which projects defense costs for the next five years, are consistent with the 2006 QDRs recommendations. Within the DoD budget, the Research, Development, Test and Evaluation budget and the Procurement budget, collectively known as the investment accounts, are a key source of funding for our programs, particularly modernization programs. These investment accounts show continued growth throughout the FYDP, with some flattening in the latter years. Given the breadth of our programs, we also receive substantial revenue from the DoDs Operations and Maintenance accounts. We expect these accounts to remain fully funded in the near term, but their funding will likely decrease as the pace of current operations declines. We also anticipate that with the control of Congress shifting parties, federal government contractors will become subject to increased scrutiny and oversight. Overall, however, we expect continued robust levels of DoD funding for ongoing operations. Internationally, the growing threat of additional terrorist activity, emerging nuclear states and conventional military threats, have led to an increase in demand for defense products and services and homeland security solutions. We anticipate that international defense budgets will grow slightly faster than domestic budgets and should also be less volatile. International customers are expected to also continue to adopt similar defense transformation initiatives as the DoDs initiatives. We believe that this trend will continue because many international customers are facing the same threat environment changes as the U.S. and they wish to assure that their forces and systems will be interoperable with U.S. and NATO forces. Against this backdrop our customers are increasingly seeking mission solutions, rather than just products or services. They also want to capture more functionality from existing assets in order to meet increasingly challenging mission needs within constrained budgets. Our Strategy and Opportunities We are focused on the following business strategic imperatives: Defend and grow our core defense markets, Sensing, C3I and Effects; Continue to expand our role in Mission Systems Integration; Accelerate our international business growth; Expand our business into adjacent and emerging markets; Become a leader in the Mission Support market; and Continue to be a customer focused company based on performance, relationships and solutions. Core markets and capabilities. We believe that our technologies, domain knowledge and key capabilities in our core defense markets and their alignment with the QDR transformational priorities and our customer needs, position us favorably to continue to grow and take market share within these markets. In particular, we leverage the following capabilities across our solutions and business segments: Our sensing capabilities encompass a broad range of technologies, including RF (radio frequency) sensors and EO (electro optical) technologies. RF technologies are used in radars, missile seekers, communications, electronic warfare and directed energy weapons, including our Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars being produced by our SAS business segment for the U.S. Air Forces F 15 and B 2 aircraft and for the U.S. Navys F/A 18 fighter jet. In addition, our IDS business segment is continuing to develop critical Gallium Nitride semiconductor technology which we believe will serve as an important building block for the next generation of radar. EO technologies allow the warfighter to see the extended battlespace across space, airborne and surface domains, including technologies that enable night vision and precision strike missions. During 2006, our SAS business segment delivered the first Block VI sensor payload for the missile detection Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS). Delivery of this infrared acquisition and track sensor suite marks a major milestone in providing the Missile Defense Agency with a space based tracking capability. We also delivered our 100th Advanced Targeting Forward Looking Infrared pod (ATFLIR) for the F/A 18 E/F. 32 Table of Contents Our C3I capabilities include situational awareness, persistent surveillance, communications, mission planning, battle management command and control, sensors and payloads, intelligence and analysis, and integrated ground solutions. During 2006, our IIS business segment successfully simulated for the first time simultaneous command and control of two unmanned UAVs and an unmanned surface vehicle from a single ground station. We also demonstrated a mobile ad hoc network that can autonomously establish itself on the battlefield and heal itself if damaged. Effects cover all systems that generate desired effects on an enemy, including using the missile as a node in the network, urban warfare applications, directed energy and lethal and non lethal applications. Our effects capabilities include advanced airframes, guidance and navigation systems, high resolution sensors, targeting and netted systems. During 2006, our MS business segment won an award to deliver wireless versions of the TOW anti tank missile. We also developed a new vertically launched loitering missile and are developing an active protection system which will destroy RPGs (rocket propelled grenades) at close range. Mission Systems Integration. We believe that our expanding Mission Systems Integration (MSI) role within our core markets will also be a key differentiator for us. MSI is the integration of multiple systems (e.g., sensors, C3I, effects) to deliver a solution designed to accomplish a specific mission for a customer. MSI requires a thorough understanding of the mission, the systems being integrated and the concept of operations. Our customer focus and program execution, our Strategic Business Areas (SBAs) and the ability of our businesses to effectively work together on broad and complex initiatives are important factors in our ability to continue to expand our MSI role. Examples of our MSI initiatives in 2006 include: Our submission, as the prime contractor of a team with EADS CASA North America, of a major proposal for the Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA) program managed by the U.S. Army and Air Force for a new transport aircraft that can perform rapid response intra theater missions; Our continued successful performance on the DDG 1000 program, including providing key deliverables and completing a number of major reviews and assessments under our integration Phase IV prime contract with the U.S. Navy; Our successes with intelligence community classified Horizontal Integration opportunities whose aim is to integrate and link mission elements, multiple sources of intelligence, and ultimately all elements of the intelligence community; and Our design and implementation of an RF identification solution to track land border entries and exits at multiple border ports for the US VISIT program. In connection with our MSI strategy, we will leverage our capabilities developed through our SBAs, including the ability to identify opportunities in critical areas and develop integrated solutions to address them through the collaboration of our business segments that offer substantial capabilities in these areas. For example: Our Missile Defense SBA is involved in the development of the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS), a system which involves sensors, interceptors, command and control, and systems integration. We are a leader in all of these areas and have a broad array of solutions to provide the capability to detect and respond to threats at all three phases of the missile defense system. Our business segments involved in BMDS include IDS and MS, and our programs include the Space Tracking and Surveillance System, Cobra Judy Radar, Kinetic Energy Interceptor, Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle, Sea Based X Band Radar, Standard Missile 3, the Patriot Air and Missile Defense System, and Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) Battle Management Command, Control and Communication. Our Precision Engagement SBA provides mission solutions across the entire precision engagement chain which are designed to address customers increasing need to operate jointly (across services and between allied forces), work in a new net centric paradigm, minimize collateral damage and strike time sensitive targets. Our precision engagement systems include F 15 and F/A 18 Active Electronically Scanned Array radars, Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile, Miniature Air Launched Decoy, Situation Awareness Data Link, UK Joint Effects Tactical Targeting System, Non Line of Sight Launch System and Precision Attack Missile, Joint Standoff Weapon, Paveway, Tactical Tomahawk and F/A 18 Radar Warning Receiver, and involve our MS, NCS and SAS business segments. Our Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance SBA utilizes our sensing, processing and dissemination technologies to provide integrated systems solutions for observing, locating, processing, deciding and disseminating actionable information, thereby enabling network centric operations for decision makers. These abilities are crucial for warfighters to achieve information dominance throughout the entire battlespace. Our ISR programs include the Global Hawk sensor suite, Distributed Common Ground System, National Polar orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite Systems, Ground Sensor Integrator and numerous classified programs, and involve our IIS and NCS business segments. 33 Table of Contents Our Homeland Security SBA leverages the technologies and solutions we have developed for our traditional defense markets to provide solutions to homeland security customers. Recent efforts included the Vigilant Eagle system, which can protect inbound and outbound aircraft from surface to air missiles using a directed energy system and Project Athena, a persistent multi domain surveillance system along the southwest Texas border for the Department of Homeland Security, and involved our MS and NCS business segments. International Opportunities. Because of the breadth of our offerings, our systems integration capability and our strong legacy in the international market, we believe that we are well positioned for continued success internationally and plan to continue to grow our international business. We believe that demand is growing for a wide set of our products and services for a variety of missions such as air and missile defense, homeland security including border surveillance, air traffic management, precision engagement, naval systems integration and intelligence and surveillance and reconnaissance as additional terrorist activity, emerging nuclear states and conventional military threats emerge and threaten our allies. In addition, as coalition forces increasingly integrate military operations worldwide, we believe that our leadership in network centric operations will be a key discriminator. Adjacent Markets. Our core markets serve as a solid base from which to expand into adjacent and emerging markets. We continually explore opportunities to use our existing capabilities or develop or acquire additional ones to expand into these markets. The following are examples of potential adjacent market opportunities: Our sensing capabilities include traditional RF and EO sensors as well as hyperspectral, acoustic, ultraviolet and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) sensors. During 2006, we started working with a partner to apply our RF technology with critical fluid technology to economically extract oil from oil shale reserves. In addition, we were selected by the Department of Homeland Security to develop the next generation Advanced Spectroscopic Portal which is being designed to detect nuclear materials at ports of entry. Our C3I capabilities cover traditional radios and command systems. However, they also encompass intelligence ground stations, knowledge discovery and information security and dissemination. During 2006, we were awarded a contract to provide the Florida Turnpike Enterprise with an open road tolling system on its highways based on our command and control technologies. Effects refers to the customers desire to generate effects on the enemy rather than just eliminate targets. This area includes directed energy weapons and information operations in addition to more traditional missiles and precision guided munitions. During 2006, we leveraged our effects capabilities to develop our Vigilant Eagle protection system for commercial and military airports, a system designed to protect aircraft from short range missile attacks by using a highly focused beam of radio frequency energy to disrupt the missile in flight. Mission Support. Mission Support focuses on enabling customer success through total life cycle support that predicts customer needs, senses potential problems and proactively responds with the most appropriate solutions. Our Mission Support capabilities include technical services, system engineering, logistics, training, operations and maintenance. During 2006, we teamed with Computer Sciences Corporation to establish the Warrior Training Alliance, an alliance of companies dedicated to providing integrated training support to the warfighter. We also received a contract to develop an aviation security enterprise management solution for the Transportation Security Administration and were awarded a DARPA contract to develop a state of the art secure communications network. In addition, we expanded outside of our traditional customer base to begin providing work on a contract to deliver managed learning services to Pfizer, Inc., a global pharmaceutical company. Customer Focus. Our customer focus continues to be a critical part of our strategy underpinned by a focus on performance, relationships and solutions. Performance means being able to meet customer commitments and is ensured through strong processes, metrics and oversight. We maintain a process architecture that spans our broad programs and pursuits. It consists of processes such as Integrated Product Development System (IPDS) which assures consistency of evaluation and execution at each gate in a programs life cycle. These processes are linked to an array of front end and back end metrics. With this structure, we are able to track results and be alerted to potential issues through numerous oversight mechanisms, including operating reviews, annual operating plan reviews and human resource reviews. We are also continuing to build strong customer relationships by listening to customers, working with them as partners and including them on Raytheon Six Sigma teams to jointly improve their programs and processes. We are increasingly 34 Table of Contents focused on responding to our customers changing requirements with rapid and effective solutions to real problems. The following is a recent example which highlights the foregoing. In response to a number of mortar attacks on Forward Operating Bases, with hospitals, in Iraq, we developed the Land based Phalanx Weapons System (LPWS). The system employs a modified version of the Navys close in weapon system, which provides terminal defense for many Navy surface ships. The LPWS went from testing to deployment of six systems in less than one year. Since becoming operational, no rockets or mortars have penetrated the protected shield provided by LPWS. Our Financial and Operating Performance Management is focused on the following financial indicators: Bookings a forward looking metric that measures the value of new contracts awarded to us during the year. Net Sales a growth metric that measures our revenue for the current year. Operating Profit from Continuing Operations which measures our profit for the year, before interest and taxes. Free Cash Flow a measure of the cash that is generated in a given year that we can use to make strategic investments to grow our business or return to our shareholders. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) which measures the return on the capital that our shareholders have invested in us. ROIC incorporates both of our financial statements (balance sheet and income statement) by, for example, measuring the reduction of fixed assets already existing on our balance sheet, as well as current return. Considered in the aggregate, we believe these five metrics are strong indicators of our overall performance and our ability to create shareholder value. We feel that these measures are balanced among long term and short term performance, growth and efficiency. We use these and other performance metrics for executive compensation purposes. In addition, we maintain a strong focus on program execution and the prudent management of capital and investments in order to maximize operating profit, cash and continue to improve ROIC. As noted earlier, we leverage our process architecture to ensure consistency of evaluation and execution at each gate in a program life cycle, as well as to track results and be alerted to potential issues through numerous oversight mechanisms, including operating reviews, annual operating plan reviews and human resource reviews. Other Business Considerations In December 2006, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell our wholly owned subsidiary, Raytheon Aircraft for approximately $3.3 billion. We decided to explore strategic alternatives for Raytheon Aircraft, a provider of business and special mission aircraft, because, among other reasons, it did not address our core markets and had limited synergies with our government and defense businesses. We felt that it was an opportune time to explore a Raytheon Aircraft transaction because we believed that Raytheon Aircraft would be an attractive business given its improving financial and operating performance in recent years and the continued strength of the general aviation market. We believe that the sale of Raytheon Aircraft will enable us to focus on our core markets and provide us with additional capital for implementing our business strategies while strengthening our balance sheet and providing us with additional financial flexibility. We currently are involved in approximately 14,000 contracts. No individual contract exceeded 5% of our sales in 2006. Our largest program was DDG 1000, which accounted for approximately 4% of total sales in 2006. Management believes that our diverse portfolio of programs and capabilities is well suited to a changing defense environment. However, we face numerous challenges and risks, as discussed below and under Item 1A Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. Assuming our sale of Raytheon Aircraft is consummated, our dependence upon the U.S. government for business will increase. Sales to the U.S. government may be affected by changes in procurement policies, budget considerations, changing defense requirements and political developments. The influence of these factors, which are largely beyond our control, could impact our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we operate in highly competitive markets. These markets are becoming increasingly more concentrated in response to the trend of certain customers awarding a smaller number of large multi service contracts and industry consolidation. Additionally, the DoD and international customers are increasingly turning to commercial contractors for IT and other support work. Our future success is dependent on our ability to execute our business strategies. First, we must continue to perform on existing programs, as past performance is an important selection criteria for new competitive awards. Second, we must successfully execute our growth strategies, as discussed above. In order to execute, we must be able to identify the most 35 Table of Contents appropriate opportunities to leverage our capabilities and technologies, as well as emerging customer trends in these markets. We then must successfully develop, market and support new offerings and technologies for those markets which will require the investment of significant financial resources and substantial management attention. We also focus on significant changes in our estimates of contract sales, costs and profits, to assess program performance and the potential impact of such change on our results of operations. As discussed in greater detail in Critical Accounting Policies, our method of accounting for our contracts requires that we estimate contract revenues and costs. Due to the size, length of time and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts, our estimates are complicated and subject to many variables. We review our contract estimates periodically to assess whether revisions are warranted and make revisions and adjustments to our estimates in the ordinary course. Changes in estimates of contract sales, costs and profits are recognized using a cumulative catch up, which results in the recognition in the current period of the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts. In addition, given our number of contracts and our accounting method, we may recognize changes in multiple contracts in a fiscal quarter that, individually, may be significant, but that result, on a net basis, in no impact on our results of operations. Alternatively, we may recognize changes in numerous contracts in a fiscal quarter that, individually, may be immaterial, but that result, collectively, in a significant change to our results of operations. FINANCIAL SUMMARY As discussed in more detail below, the following is a summary of our gross bookings, net sales, operating income and operating cash flow. The summary information below, as well as our financial information contained elsewhere in this Form 10 K, excludes the results of Raytheon Aircraft Company which have been reclassified as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. Gross bookings were $23.0 billion in 2006, $21.3 billion in 2005 and $22.6 billion in 2004, resulting in backlog of $33.8 billion, $31.5 billion and $29.9 billion at December 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Backlog represents future sales expected to be recognized over the contract period, which is generally the next several years. Net sales were $20.3 billion in 2006, $19.0 billion in 2005 and $17.8 billion in 2004. The increase in sales in 2006 was primarily due to higher sales at Integrated Defense Systems, Missile Systems and Network Centric Systems. Operating income was $1.8 billion in 2006, $1.5 billion in 2005 and $1.3 billion in 2004. Operating income as a percent of net sales was 9.1%, 7.9% and 7.3% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Included in operating income was a FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment, described below in Consolidated Results of Operations, of $362 million in 2006, $448 million in 2005 and $457 million of expense in 2004. The FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment in 2007 is expected to be approximately $270 million of expense. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $2.5 billion in 2006, $2.3 billion in 2005 and $1.7 billion in 2004. Total debt was $4.0 billion at December 31, 2006 versus $4.5 billion at December 31, 2005. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to our financial statements. We believe that the policies set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting policies and represent the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements. We believe our judgments related to these accounting policies are appropriate. However, if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from the amounts recorded. Revenue Recognition We account for our contracts associated with the design, development, manufacture, service or modification of complex aerospace or electronic equipment or otherwise within the scope of Chapter 11 of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Government Contracts (ARB No. 43) or Statement of Position 81 1, Accounting for 36 Table of Contents Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts (SOP 81 1), using the percentage of completion accounting method. Under this method, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the long term contract. The selection of the method by which to measure such progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We generally use the cost to cost measure of progress. Under this measure, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the contract. Revenues, including estimated earned fees or profits, are recorded as costs are incurred. Accordingly, management must make estimates of contract revenues and costs which requires judgment. Incentive and award provisions are recorded when it is probable that they will be awarded and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. Claims are recorded only if it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and the amounts can be reliably estimated. We review our contract estimates periodically to assess whether revisions are warranted. Changes in estimates of contract sales, costs and profits are recognized using a cumulative catch up which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period the loss is determined. To a much lesser extent, we also enter into contracts that are not associated with the design, development, manufacture, service or modification of complex aerospace or electronic equipment, or not otherwise within the scope of ARB No. 43 or SOP 81 1. We account for those contracts in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) No. 104, Revenue Recognition, or other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature. Revenue under such contracts is generally recognized upon delivery or as the service is performed. Revenue from software is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, the software has been delivered and customer acceptance has been received, our fee is fixed and determinable and collectibility is probable. Revenue from license fees is recognized over the expected life of the continued involvement with the customer. Revenue from the sale of fractional shares is recognized over the expected life of the customer relationship. We apply the separation guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables (EITF 00 21), for contracts with multiple deliverables. Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables can be divided into more than one unit of accounting. For contracts with more than one unit of accounting, we recognize revenue for each deliverable based on the revenue recognition policies discussed above. In 2006, 2005 and 2004, operating income as a percent of net sales did not vary by more than 1.8%. A 1.8% change in operating income as a percent of net sales in 2006 would change our operating income by approximately $365 million. Impairment of Goodwill and Long lived Assets We evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets upon the indication of possible impairment by measuring the carrying amount of the assets against the related estimated undiscounted cash flows. When an evaluation indicates that the future undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets, the assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value. The determination of what constitutes an indication of possible impairment, the estimation of future cash flows and the determination of estimated fair value are all significant judgments. In addition, we perform an annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of each year. We estimate the fair value of reporting units using a discounted cash flow model based on our most recent long range plan and compare the estimated fair value to the net book value of the reporting unit, including goodwill. Preparation of forecasts for use in the long range plan and the selection of the discount rate involve significant judgments. Changes in these forecasts or the discount rate selected could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period; however, a 10% decrease in the current estimated fair value of any of our reporting units would not result in a goodwill impairment charge except at Flight Options. In 2006, we recorded a $55 million pretax, $48 million after tax, goodwill impairment charge at Flight Options. In 2005, we recorded a $22 million pretax, $19 million after tax, goodwill impairment charge at Flight Options. These charges are described in Note 1, Accounting Policies of the Notes to the Financial Statements. Pension Costs We have pension plans covering the majority of our employees, including certain employees in foreign countries. Our pension expense is expected to be approximately $680 million in 2007 and $549 million in 2008. The selection of the assumptions used to determine pension expense involves significant judgment. Our long term return on asset (ROA) and discount rate assumptions are the key variables in determining pension expense. 37 Table of Contents To develop the long term ROA assumption, we perform periodic studies which consider our asset allocation strategies, recent and anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes, and the associated risk. Since our investment policy is to employ active management strategies in all asset classes, the potential exists to outperform the broader markets; therefore, the expected returns are higher than the broader markets. The investment policy asset allocation ranges are as follows: Equities 50% to 75% Debt Securities 20% to 40% Real Estate 2% to 7% Other (including private equity and cash) 2% to 17% The long term ROA assumption for our domestic pension plans in 2007 is 8.75%, unchanged from 2006. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected ROA assumption would increase or decrease our estimated pension expense in 2007 by approximately $31 million. For every 2.5% that the actual domestic pension plan asset return exceeds or is less than the long term ROA assumption for 2007, our estimated pension expense for 2008 would change by approximately $17 million. The discount rate assumption is determined by using a model consisting of a theoretical bond portfolio for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximates the estimated benefit payments of our pension plans. The discount rate assumption for our domestic pension plans in 2007 is 6.0%, an increase from 5.75% in 2006. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption for 2008 would increase or decrease our estimated pension expense for 2008 by approximately $45 million. Other variables that can impact the pension funded status and expense include demographic experience such as the rates of salary increase, retirement, turnover and mortality. Assumptions for these variables are set based on actual and projected plan experience. Effective December 31, 2005, we updated our mortality assumption for our pension and postretirement benefit programs to a blend of our own historical experience and a table representing broad expectations of U.S. mortality rates to reflect changes in the lifespan of the pension population. This assumption change resulted in an increase in 2006 pension expense of $130 million. In addition, we have $3.9 billion of deferred losses resulting primarily from differences between actual and assumed asset returns, changes in discount rates, changes in plan provisions and differences between actual and assumed demographic experience. To the extent we continue to have fluctuations in these items we will experience increases or decreases in our funded status and related accrued retiree benefit obligation. For every 25 basis point change in discount rate, our projected benefit obligation for the pension plans as of December 31, 2006 would change by approximately $500 million. In addition, a 1% change in the actual domestic pension plan asset return compared to the long term ROA assumption would change the market value of pension plan assets as of December 31, 2006 by approximately $100 million. The deferred losses are amortized and included in future pension expense over the average employee service period of approximately 12 years. As described in Note 1 to the Financial Statements, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of FASB Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158) for the year ended December 31, 2006 which resulted in a $1.9 billion increase in accrued retiree benefits and other long term liabilities and a corresponding $1.3 billion decrease, net of taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity. Effective January 1, 2007, all newly hired or rehired employees will participate in a new defined contribution plan in lieu of our existing pension plans, subject to any applicable collective bargaining agreements. Our current eligible employees will continue to participate in our existing pension plans without any change to level of benefits or payment options. This change is not expected to have a material impact on our estimated pension expense or contributions in 2007. CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net sales were $20.3 billion in 2006, $19.0 billion in 2005 and $17.8 billion in 2004. The increase in sales in 2006 was primarily due to higher sales at Integrated Defense Systems, Missile Systems and Network Centric Systems. The increase in sales in 2005 was primarily due to higher sales at Integrated Defense Systems and Missile Systems. Sales to the U.S. Department of Defense were 77% of sales in 2006, 75% in 2005 and 74% in 2004. Total sales to the U.S. government were 38 Table of Contents 84% of sales in 2006, 83% in 2005 and 82% in 2004. Included in U.S. government sales were foreign military sales of $1.3 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. We currently expect defense market trends to continue to positively impact our sales in 2007; however, our expectation is based on certain assumptions and estimates regarding factors, such as U.S. government budget and appropriation decisions and geo political events and macroeconomic conditions, which are beyond our control. Total international sales, including foreign military sales, were $3.7 billion or 18% of sales in 2006, $3.4 billion or 18% in 2005 and $3.3 billion or 18% in 2004. Gross margin (net sales less cost of sales) was $3.7 billion in 2006, $3.2 billion in 2005 and $2.9 billion in 2004, or 18.4% of sales in 2006, 17.0% in 2005 and 16.4% in 2004. Included in gross margin was a FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment, described below, of $362 million, $448 million and $457 million of expense in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment represents the difference between our pension expense or income under SFAS No. 87 and our pension expense under Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) and is reported as a separate line item in our segment results. SFAS No. 87 outlines the methodology used to determine pension expense or income for financial reporting purposes, which is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements of pension plans that are determined by other factors. Cost Accounting Standards (CAS) prescribe the allocation to and recovery of pension costs on U.S. government contracts and is a major factor in determining pension funding requirements. The results for each segment only include pension expense as determined under CAS that can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. Administrative and selling expenses were $1,422 million or 7.0% of sales in 2006, $1,290 million or 6.8% of sales in 2005 and $1,202 million or 6.7% of sales in 2004. Included in administrative and selling expenses in 2006 and 2005 was a $55 million and $22 million, respectively, goodwill impairment charge related to Flight Options described below in Segment Results. Research and development expenses were $464 million or 2.3% of sales in 2006, $430 million or 2.3% of sales in 2005 and $413 million or 2.3% of sales in 2004. Operating income was $1,840 million or 9.1% of sales in 2006, $1,512 million or 7.9% of sales in 2005 and $1,301 million or 7.3% of sales in 2004. The changes in operating income by segment are described below in Segment Results. Interest expense was $273 million in 2006, $312 million in 2005 and $418 million in 2004. The decreases in interest expense in 2006 and 2005 were due to lower average outstanding debt, partially offset by a higher weighted average cost of borrowing for those years. Other (income) expense, net was $44 million of income in 2006, $12 million of income in 2005 and $436 million of expense in 2004. Included in other (income) expense, net in 2006 was a $24 million gain on the sale of Space Imaging assets and a $34 million favorable adjustment resulting from the settlement of a class action lawsuit, partially offset by a $7 million charge for the tentative settlement of the ERISA purported class action lawsuit filed in 2003 (both lawsuits are described in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Financial Statements). Included in other (income) expense, net in 2005 was a $45 million gain on the sale of our investment in Indra ATM S.L., a Spanish joint venture, partially offset by a $12 million charge related to our settlement with the SEC and a $10 million charge related to the early redemption of debt. Included in other expense, net in 2004 was a $325 million charge related to our settlement of a securities class action lawsuit described in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Financial Statements and a $132 million charge related to our repurchase of long term debt and subordinated notes payable. The effective tax rate was 34.4% in 2006, 34.7% in 2005 and 22.6% in 2004, reflecting the U.S. statutory rate adjusted for various permanent differences between book and tax reporting. The effective tax rate in 2006 was reduced by ESOP dividend deductions, manufacturing and export related tax benefits and research credits, and was increased by various non deductible expenses. Included in the effective tax rate in 2006 was the impact of the nondeductible portion of the $55 million Flight Options goodwill impairment charge. The effective tax rate in 2005 and 2004 was reduced by ESOP dividend deductions, export related tax benefits and research credits, and was increased by various non deductible expenses. Included in the effective tax rate in 2005 was the impact of the $12 million nondeductible settlement with the 39 Table of Contents SEC, the impact of the nondeductible portion of the $22 million Flight Options goodwill impairment charge, an $18 million accrual related to adjustments resulting from examinations by taxing authorities and other tax issues and a $5 million accrual related to the repatriation of earnings from foreign subsidiaries. Included in the effective tax rate in 2004 was a $42 million benefit from a change in tax law primarily related to the extension of the foreign tax credit carryforward periods from five to 10 years. The provision for state income taxes has been included in administrative and selling expenses as these costs can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. Income from continuing operations was $1,107 million or $2.46 per diluted share on 450.9 million average shares outstanding in 2006, $818 million or $1.80 per diluted share on 453.3 million average shares outstanding in 2005 and $374 million or $0.85 per diluted share on 442.2 million average shares outstanding in 2004. Income from discontinued operations, net of tax, described below in Discontinued Operations, was $176 million or $0.39 per diluted share in 2006, $53 million or $0.12 per diluted share in 2005 and $2 million in 2004. Effective January 1, 2004, we changed the measurement date for our pension and other postretirement benefit plans from October 31 to December 31. This change in measurement date was accounted for as a change in accounting principle. The cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was a gain of $53 million pretax for pension benefits and a gain of $10 million pretax for other postretirement benefits. Using our year end as the measurement date for pension and other postretirement benefit plans more appropriately reflects the plans financial status for the years then ended. In 2004, the total cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle was a gain of $63 million pretax, $41 million after tax, or $0.09 per diluted share. Net income was $1,283 million or $2.85 per diluted share in 2006, $871 million or $1.92 per diluted share in 2005 and $417 million or $0.94 per diluted share in 2004. The tables below present net sales, operating income, backlog and gross bookings by segment. A discussion on each segments results follows.

Integrated Defense Systems (IDS) % Change (In millions except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 2006versus2005 2005versus2004 Net Sales $ 4,220 $ 3,807 $ 3,456 10.8 % 10.2 % Operating Income 691 548 417 26.1 % 31.4 % Operating Margin 16.4 % 14.4 % 12.1 % Gross Bookings 4,118 5,265 3,494 21.8 % 50.7 % Total Backlog 7,934 8,010 6,628 0.9 % 20.9 % IDS provides integrated solutions for ballistic missile defense, air defense, naval and maritime systems and homeland security applications, which enable situational awareness and joint integrated fires. During 2006, IDS, as the prime mission systems equipment integrator for all electronic and combat systems of the DDG 1000 Zumwalt Class Destroyer program (DDG 1000), continued to make significant progress on the program. IDS also expanded its international business and continued to evolve its products and technologies for use in other markets, such as homeland security. Net Sales. The increase in sales in 2006 was primarily attributable to growth on the DDG 1000 program. The program growth was due to the ramp up of the detail design and integration phase of the program during which we transitioned into the prime contractor role. In addition, sales increased due to growth on certain international missile defense programs primarily the Taiwan Early Warning Surveillance Radar System program. The increases were offset in part by the completion of certain U.S. Navy programs. The increase in sales in 2005 was due to growth on the Cobra Judy Replacement Mission Equipment program and increased volume on several international programs. Operating Income and Margin. The increase in operating margin in 2006 was primarily due to performance improvements from lean manufacturing initiatives on several domestic programs and performance improvements and higher sales volume on certain international programs. The increase in operating margin in 2005 was due to higher sales and program performance improvements on certain international programs. The 2007 margin is expected to be slightly lower than 2006 primarily due to a higher mix of cost type development work which generally has lower margins. 41 Table of Contents Bookings and Backlog. IDS booked $1.0 billion in 2006 and $1.7 billion in 2005 to continue the Ship System integration and detail design for DDG 1000 and $631 million in 2005 to provide Taiwan with an Early Warning Surveillance Radar System. Intelligence and Information Systems (IIS) % Change (In millions except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 2006versus2005 2005versus2004 Net Sales $ 2,560 $ 2,509 $ 2,334 2.0 % 7.5 % Operating Income 234 229 203 2.2 % 12.8 % Operating Margin 9.1 % 9.1 % 8.7 % Gross Bookings 2,701 2,537 2,272 6.5 % 11.7 % Total Backlog 3,935 4,077 4,066 3.5 % 0.3 % IIS provides integrated ground systems for signal and image intelligence and weather and climate systems, command and control solutions for air/space platforms, operations, maintenance and engineering (OM&E) services, homeland security and information technology solutions. During 2006, IIS continued to perform well in its classified business, gaining numerous contracts on major classified programs as well as increasing its position in several targeted markets. IIS also continued to work on a broad range of cutting edge programs, including developing the Distributed Common Ground System (DCGS) Integrated Backbone, providing worldwide support for the U 2 reconnaissance aircraft, developing the NPOESS system to collect and disseminate specialized meteorological, oceanographic and solar geophysical data to worldwide users and creating new control systems for unmanned vehicles. Net Sales. The increase in sales in 2006 was primarily due to scope expansions and other growth on certain classified programs offset by procurement delays resulting from budget constraints with several classified customers. Sales for the first half of 2007 are expected to continue to be negatively affected by these factors. The increase in sales in 2005 reflects growth from new classified programs awarded in late 2004 and early 2005. Operating Income and Margin. Operating margins remained relatively consistent in 2006, 2005 and 2004. Accordingly, the operating income increases were primarily due to changes in volume. Bookings and backlog. The increase in 2006 bookings was primarily due to increased bookings on classified programs. Backlog in 2006 was negatively affected by procurement delays and budget constraints with several classified customers. Missile Systems (MS) % Change (In millions except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 2006versus2005 2005versus2004 Net Sales $ 4,503 $ 4,124 $ 3,844 9.2 % 7.3 % Operating Income 479 431 436 11.1 % 1.1 % Operating Margin 10.6 % 10.5 % 11.3 % Gross Bookings 6,021 3,808 7,179 58.1 % 47.0 % Total Backlog 9,504 8,040 8,341 18.2 % 3.6 % MS provides a broad range of cutting edge weapon systems that includes missiles, smart munitions, projectiles, kinetic kill vehicles, space vehicles and directed energy effectors. During 2006, MS continued to demonstrate its missile defense capability with several significant test successes, including one of the sea based system with Standard Missile 3 (SM 3) and one of the ground based system that incorporates the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV). MS also provided a rapid response to warfighter needs with a land based Phalanx system to counter rockets, artillery and mortar threats. In addition, MS continued to develop and evolve its technologies for new applications and other markets. 42 Table of Contents Net Sales. The increase in sales in 2006 was primarily due to the ramp up on several development programs including Non Line of Sight Launch System (NLOS) and Standard Missile 6. Sales also increased due to production on Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM) and Standard Missile 2, which received various international awards in 2006 and Tube launched Optically guided Wire controlled missile (TOW) which returned to full rate production following a gap in 2005. These sales increases were partially offset by lower Paveway guided munitions production and the completion of several classified programs. The increase in sales in 2005 was due primarily to increased quantities on Tactical Tomahawk resulting from the transition to full rate production and the gradual increases in support of requirements for several development programs including Kinetic Energy Interceptor (KEI), SM 3, Standard Missile 6 and NLOS. Sales growth is expected to slow in 2007 as a number of development programs reach peak levels prior to transitioning to production. Operating Income and Margin. The increase in operating income in 2006 was due to increased sales on several production and development programs. Operating income in 2006 also included an award fee from a successful SM 3 flight test. The decline in operating margin in 2005 was due to the wind down of cost recovery for prior restructuring actions. Bookings and Backlog. In 2006, MS booked $780 million for additional development on KEI for the Missile Defense Agency, $678 million for the EKV contract and $625 million on SM 3. In 2004, MS booked $2.1 billion for the KEI system contract, $544 million for the NLOS contract and $500 million on SM 3. Network Centric Systems (NCS) % Change (In millions except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 2006versus2005 2005versus2004 Net Sales $ 3,561 $ 3,205 $ 3,050 11.1 % 5.1 % Operating Income 379 333 269 13.8 % 23.8 % Operating Margin 10.6 % 10.4 % 8.8 % Gross Bookings 4,037 3,698 3,219 9.2 % 14.9 % Total Backlog 5,059 4,307 3,587 17.5 % 20.1 % NCS develops and produces net centric mission solutions for networked sensors, command and control communications, air traffic management and homeland security. During 2006, NCS acquired Houston Associates, Inc. and Virtual Technology Corporation. Both companies complement NCS network systems capabilities portfolio. NCS also expanded its business in the emerging homeland security market for border and perimeter security, winning a contract to develop and implement the Perimeter Intrusion Detection System (PIDS) for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Net Sales. The increase in sales in 2006 was due to accelerated production on certain contracts at the customers request in support of the Iraqi Freedom campaign mainly in the Combat Systems business. The increase in sales was also due to the continued ramp up in the Future Combat System Ground Sensor Integrator program (FCS GSI). This growth was partially offset by the continued ramp down on Thermal Weapon Site (TWS) and by a slowing in the secondary air traffic radar market. The increase in sales in 2005 was due to growth in development and communications programs. This growth was offset by TWS and DDG 1000 programs and the divestiture of Raytheon Commercial Infrared. The 2007 sales growth rate is expected to be lower than that experienced in 2006 as a result of the accelerated production on certain programs in 2006 related to the Iraqi Freedom campaign. Operating Income and Margin. The increase in operating income and margin in 2006 was driven by increased volume and continued program performance improvements. The increase in operating margin in 2005 related to program performance improvements on production programs. Bookings and Backlog. In 2006 NCS booked $363 million to provide Horizontal Technology Integration (HTI) forward looking infrared kits and systems to the U.S. Army. In addition, in 2006 NCS booked two contracts for its Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS) for the U.S. Army and Marines which totaled $447 million. In 2005, NCS booked $484 million for the FCS GSI contract. 43 Table of Contents Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) % Change (In millions except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 2006versus2005 2005versus2004 Net Sales $ 4,319 $ 4,175 $ 4,068 3.4 % 2.6 % Operating Income 604 606 568 0.3 % 6.7 % Operating Margin 14.0 % 14.5 % 14.0 % Gross Bookings 4,021 3,996 3,901 0.6 % 2.4 % Total Backlog 5,591 5,220 5,216 7.1 % 0.1 % SAS designs and develops integrated systems and solutions for advanced missions including intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance, precision engagement, unmanned aerial operations, special forces operations and space. During 2006, SAS submitted a major proposal for the Joint Cargo Aircraft (JCA) program managed by the U.S. Army and Air Force, which we anticipate will be decided in early 2007. The JCA will be a new transport aircraft that can perform rapid response intra theater missions with cargo, equipment and soldiers, and would represent a key Mission System Integration role for the business. Net Sales. The increase in sales in 2006 was primarily due to increased production on the Advanced Targeting Forward Looking Infrared (ATFLIR) program. Sales also increased due to additional orders for Hunter Strike targeting systems and a follow on contract for International Greek Advanced Self Protection Integrated Suite (ASPIS) electronic warfare products, partially offset by the restructuring of space programs. Sales growth in 2005 was driven by the ramp up of full rate production for ATFLIR and the Electronic Warfare Decoy programs, partially offset by lower sales on an international program and the beginning of the restructuring of space programs. Operating Income and Margin. The decrease in operating margin in 2006 was due to the completion of a number of mature airborne radar production programs which delivered their final product in the first quarter of 2006 and had provided margin improvement in late 2004 and 2005. The increase in operating margin in 2005 was due to charges in 2004 on an international program of $55 million as a result of a qualification test failure, and productivity improvements in 2005 on certain mature airborne radar production programs, partially offset by cost growth on development programs. The 2007 margin is expected to be lower than 2006 primarily due to certain profit improvements not expected to recur on programs at or nearing completion in 2006. Backlog and Bookings. In 2006, SAS booked approximately $1.5 billion on classified contracts. In 2005, SAS booked $586 million for a multi year production contract of 190 APG 79 Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars for the F/A 18 Super Hornet program. In 2004, SAS booked over $1.3 billion on a number of classified contracts.

These solution sets are Raytheon technologies for implementing Mission Support and are designed to enable customers to more efficiently address their logistics transformation challenges. Net Sales. The increase in sales in 2006 was primarily due to additional deliveries and the ramp up of construction services on contracts within our Logisitics and Training Systems (LTS) business. This was partially offset by the wind down of three major programs, GUAM, AUTEC and Navy and Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI). Operating Income and Margin. The decrease in operating margin in 2006 was primarily due to a profit adjustment related to certain program costs which may be deemed unrecoverable. Bookings and Backlog. In 2006, TS booked $198 million for the Nuclear Weapons Safety and Security (NWSS Torp83) program. Other % Change (In millions except percentages) 2006 2005 2004 2006versus2005 2005versus2004 Net Sales $ 828 $ 781 $ 675 6.0 % 15.7 % Operating Loss (94 ) (123 ) (31 ) 23.6 % 296.8 % Operating Margin 11.4 % 15.7 % 4.6 % Gross Bookings 769 787 752 2.3 % 4.7 % Total Backlog 243 280 294 13.2 % 4.8 % The Other category is comprised of Flight Options LLC (FO), Raytheon Airline Aviation Services LLC (RAAS) and Raytheon Professional Services LLC (RPS). FO offers services in the aircraft fractional ownership industry, including programs for ownership shares of new and used aircraft, aircraft leasing and prepaid hourly membership programs. RAAS manages the long term wind down of our commuter aircraft business. RPS works with customers to design and execute learning solutions. The increase in net sales in 2006 was mainly due to higher sales at FO and RPS while the decrease in operating loss in 2006 was primarily due to improved operating performance at FO and, to a lesser extent, improvements at RAAS partially offset by a goodwill impairment charge at FO of $55 million. The increase in sales in 2005 was mainly due to higher sales at FO and RPS while the increase in operating loss in 2005 was primarily due to the operating results of FO, a goodwill impairment charge at FO of $22 million and to a lesser extent the operating results of RAAS. The higher operating loss at FO in 2005 was due to increased supplemental lift (higher third party chartering expense) and maintenance expense related to the operational impacts primarily from older aircraft in the fleet and the timing of peak customer demand. FO also recorded a $7 million charge in 2005 related to the settlement of a lawsuit against FO and its minority shareholders. The higher losses at RAAS in 2005 were due to higher aircraft maintenance expense in the period. The goodwill impairment charges of $55 million in 2006 and $22 million in 2005 at FO were based upon our determination that the fair value of the business was not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets, including goodwill. We estimated the fair value of FO using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the respective FO long range plan and the financial objectives therein. This methodology involved significant judgment regarding FOs projected future cash flows and expected market conditions, and their impact on the selection of the discount rate used in estimating the fair value of FO. The 2005 impairment charge was driven by a downward revision of FOs then current long range plan as a result of 2005 performance, changes in valuation assumptions and the increase in goodwill as a result 45 Table of Contents of the acquisition of the minority shares. FO implemented several measures in 2006 to improve its operating performance and increase its customer satisfaction, including replacing older aircraft, reducing the number of different types of aircraft in its fleet, improving dispatch rates and improving occupied rates. In 2006, FOs cash flows and financial results improved over 2005; however, during 2006 and, in particular, in the fourth quarter, certain unexpected events occurred and conditions arose which negatively impacted the estimated value of the business. In the fourth quarter, FO experienced a significant increase in competition in its fractional share business and its sales forecast became more difficult to predict as a result of the acceleration of a continued shift in customer demand from fractional shares to the less predictable membership card program. During 2006, the business was also negatively affected by the notification of a potential federal excise tax audit and the pilots vote to be represented by a union, as discussed below. As a result of these factors, we increased the discount rate used in determining FOs value from 11% in 2005 to 13% in 2006, which reduced the estimated fair value of FO. We determined the discount rate by developing a theoretical weighted average cost of capital and adjusted that amount, as necessary, for an equity risk premium to the extent there are unique risks not considered in the benchmark data. Based on the foregoing, we determined that the implied fair value of goodwill decreased from $133 million to $78 million which resulted in the $55 million goodwill impairment charge. An additional increase in the discount rate of 1% would result in an additional goodwill impairment charge of approximately $21 million. FO must continue to demonstrate substantial operating performance improvement, including achieving its sales forecasts and reducing operating expenses, to meet its projected financial objectives and estimated future cash flows. We periodically evaluate whether conditions exist or events have occurred that impact FOs ability to achieve its financial objectives or otherwise affect the value of FO, including the matters discussed below. Other conditions or events may include a downturn in the fractional ownership or general aviation markets, continued increased competition, an increase in FOs operating costs due to higher aircraft or other costs, a change in our operating model or strategy with respect to FO or other information regarding its market value. If, in the future, we determine that the fair value of FO, which is largely based upon FOs projected future financial performance assuming continued operation by us, is less than its carrying value, then our investment in FO could become further impaired. Although we do not believe that FO is further impaired at this time, in the event that such a condition or event occurs, we may record additional charges which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. As of December 31, 2006, the consolidated net assets of FO were $239 million including a remaining goodwill balance of $78 million. In the third quarter of 2006, we were informed by the Internal Revenue Service that it intends to conduct a federal excise tax audit at FO, which we believe will cover our treatment of certain FO customer fees and charges. We believe that an unfavorable outcome is not probable because, among other reasons, there is a reasonable basis for our position that federal excise tax does not apply to management fees charged to our customers and such position is consistent with industry practice. Nevertheless, the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain and difficult to predict and an unfavorable outcome could have a material effect on our results of operations. In March 2006, pilots at FO voted to be represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters. FO is engaged in good faith negotiations with the union to reach a mutually acceptable labor agreement for its pilots. While the terms of any future labor agreement, if any, are presently indeterminable, such an agreement could result in changes in pilots wages, benefits and working conditions that may increase FOs operating costs and impact our competitive position in the fractional aircraft market. RAAS has exposure to outstanding financing arrangements for commuter aircraft, with the aircraft serving as collateral for these arrangements. Commuter aircraft customers of RAAS are generally thinly capitalized companies whose financial condition could be significantly affected by sustained higher fuel costs, industry consolidation and declining commercial aviation market conditions. At December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, our exposure on commuter aircraft assets held as inventory, collateral on notes or as leased assets, was approximately $325 million relating to 192 aircraft and $475 million relating to 253 aircraft, respectively. The valuation of used aircraft in inventories, which are stated at cost, but not in excess of realizable value, requires significant judgment. The valuation of used aircraft is also considered in assessing the realizable value of certain commuter related assets which serve as collateral for the underlying financing arrangements. As part of the assessment of realizable value, the Company evaluates many factors including current market conditions, future market conditions, the age and condition of the aircraft, and availability levels for the aircraft in the market. The carrying value of commuter aircraft assets assumes an orderly disposition of these assets. If we were to dispose of these assets in an other than orderly disposition, or sell the business in its entirety, the value realized would likely be reduced. 46 Table of Contents DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Income from discontinued operations consists of the following results from Raytheon Aircraft, Raytheon Engineers & Constructors business (RE&C) and Aircraft Integration Systems business (AIS): Pretax After tax (In millions) 2006 2005 2004 2006 2005 2004 Raytheon Aircraft $ 274 $ 187 $ 96 $ 181 $ 124 $ 65 RE&C (6 ) (41 ) (42 ) (4 ) (50 ) (48 ) AIS (1 ) (33 ) (23 ) (1 ) (21 ) (15 ) Total $ 267 $ 113 $ 31 $ 176 $ 53 $ 2 Raytheon Aircraft In December 2006, we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Raytheon Aircraft Company for approximately $3.3 billion. The transaction, which is subject to customary conditions and regulatory approvals, is expected to close in the first half of 2007. We decided to explore strategic alternatives for Raytheon Aircraft, a provider of business and special mission aircraft, because, among other reasons, it did not address our core markets and had limited synergies with our government and defense businesses. We felt that it was an opportune time to explore a Raytheon Aircraft transaction because we believed that Raytheon Aircraft would be an attractive business given its improving financial and operating performance in recent years and the continued strength of the general aviation market. We believe that the sale of Raytheon Aircraft will enable us to focus on our core markets and provide us with additional capital for implementing our business strategies while strengthening our balance sheet and providing us with additional financial flexibility. Raytheon Aircraft designs, develops, manufactures, markets and provides global support for business jets, turboprops and piston powered aircraft for the worlds commercial, fractional ownership and military aircraft markets, and constitutes substantially all of our Aircraft segment. As a result of entering into the definitive agreement, we have reported Raytheon Aircraft as a discontinued operation in this Form 10 K in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long lived Assets. Accordingly, our result of operations for all periods presented have been reclassified to reflect Raytheon Aircraft as discontinued operations, and the assets and liabilities of Raytheon Aircraft have been reclassified as held for sale in our Consolidated Balance Sheet for all periods presented. Raytheon Engineers & Constructors In 2000, we sold RE&C to Washington Group International, Inc. (WGI). As a result of WGIs bankruptcy, we were required to perform various contract and lease obligations under letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees (Support Agreements) that it had provided to project owners and other parties. We have since settled many of those Support Agreement obligations. For the remaining Support Agreement obligations, we have various risks and exposures, including warranty close out, various liquidated damages issues and potential adverse claims resolution. In 2005 and 2004, we recorded after tax charges of $23 million and $24 million, respectively, for an estimated liability for foreign tax related matters. Although not expected to be material, additional losses on foreign tax related matters could be recorded in the future as estimates are revised or the underlying matters are settled. Aircraft Integration Systems In 2002, we sold AIS for $1,123 million, net, subject to purchase price adjustments. As part of the transaction, we retained the responsibility for performance of the Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) program and retained certain assets related to the BBJ program, which is now essentially complete. In January 2006, a dispute regarding the AIS purchase price was resolved in arbitration and we recorded a pretax charge of $26 million in 2005 related to this settlement. In the first quarter of 2006, all liabilities related to the purchase price dispute were discharged. 47 Table of Contents FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY We pursue a capital deployment strategy that balances funding for growing our business, including capital expenditures, acquisitions and research and development, managing our balance sheet, including debt repayments and pension contributions, and returning cash to our shareholders, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, as outlined below. Upon the consummation of the sale of Raytheon Aircraft, we expect to receive net after tax proceeds of approximately $2.5 billion during the first half of 2007. We intend to use these proceeds in a manner consistent with our capital deployment strategy. Operating Activities We continue to focus on improving our cash generation and management. Net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 was $2,743 million versus $2,515 million in 2005 and $2,071 million in 2004. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $2,469 million in 2006, $2,313 million in 2005 and $1,689 million in 2004. The increase in net cash provided by operating activities in 2006 was primarily due to higher conversion of net income partially offset by higher cash tax payments. We have also made working capital improvements. Although we will continue to focus on working capital, we do not expect the rate of improvement experienced in prior periods to continue in 2007. Total net cash tax payments were approximately $375 million, $56 million and $5 million in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. Tax payments in 2007 are expected to approximate $600 million excluding taxes on the expected gain related to the sale of Raytheon Aircraft. We make both discretionary and required contributions to our pension plans. In January 2007, we made $400 million of discretionary contributions to our pension plan, versus $200 million in both 2006 and 2005. We expect to make total contributions, required and discretionary, to our pension plans of approximately $815 million in 2007. As described in Note 1, Accounting Policies, of the Notes to the Financial Statements, we adopted SFAS No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans (SFAS No. 158) for the year ended December 31, 2006, which resulted in a $1.9 billion increase in accrued retiree benefits and other long term liabilities and a corresponding $1.3 billion decrease, net of taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity. In 2004 we made a $210 million payment in connection with the settlement of the securities class action lawsuit as discussed in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies, of the Notes to the Financial Statements. We received approximately $75 million of insurance proceeds related to this lawsuit in 2005. We provide long term financing to our commuter and fractional aircraft customers. Origination of financing receivables was $8 million in 2006, $23 million in 2005 and $29 million in 2004. Collection of financing receivables not sold was $123 million in 2006, $128 million in 2005 and $122 million in 2004. We received proceeds of $53 million in 2006 related to the sale of certain finance receivables. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities was $451 million in 2006 versus $436 million in 2005 and $532 million in 2004. Capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment were $295 million in 2006, $298 million in 2005 and $317 million in 2004. Capitalized expenditures for internal use software were $77 million in 2006, $73 million in 2005 and $96 million in 2004. We expect our capital and internal use software expenditures to be approximately $350 million and $100 million, respectively, in 2007, consistent with the anticipated growth of our business and for specific investments. In pursuing our business strategies, we acquire and make investments in certain businesses that meet certain strategic and financial criteria. In 2006, we acquired Houston Associates, Inc. for $47 million and Virtual Technology Corporation for $40 million. In 2005, we paid the third and final installment of $60 million related to our 2003 acquisition of Solipsys Corporation. Also in 2005, we acquired UTD, Inc. for $39 million and the remaining interest in Flight Options for $26 million. In 2004, we paid the second installment of $70 million related to the acquisition of Solipsys Corporation and acquired Photon Research Associates, Inc. for $42 million. In addition, from time to time, we divest of certain non core businesses and investments. As previously discussed, in December 2006 we entered into a definitive agreement to sell Raytheon Aircraft. The transaction is expected to be completed in the first half of 2007. In 2006, we sold our investment in HRL Laboratories, LLC for $28 million and received proceeds of $24 million related to the sale of Space Imaging assets. In 2005, we sold our investment in Indra ATM S.L., a Spanish joint venture, for $59 million and in 2004, we sold our commercial infrared business for $43 million. 48 Table of Contents Financing Activities Cash provided by operating activities has been the primary source used to repay debt, pay dividends and repurchase common stock. Net cash used in financing activities was $1,034 million in 2006 versus $1,433 million in 2005 and $1,644 million in 2004. Through repayment activities during the period, our debt has been reduced from $8.3 billion at December 31, 2002 to $4.0 billion at December 31, 2006. In 2006, we retired $408 million of subordinated notes payable which had matured, including a payment of $382 million and a reduction in our investment in RC Trust I of $26 million. In 2005, we repaid $671 million of long term debt including the exercise of our call rights to repurchase long term debt with a par value of $196 million at a loss of $10 million pretax. In 2004, we repurchased long term debt and subordinated notes payable with a par value of $2,254 million at a loss of $132 million pretax. In December 2006, our Board of Directors, subject to the closing of our sale of Raytheon Aircraft, authorized the early retirement of approximately $1 billion of our outstanding notes and debentures. We expect to incur a loss of approximately $0.10 per share related to this early retirement of debt. The loss was based on an estimate of the fair value of debt which may differ upon retirement. The $1 billion early retirement of debt is in addition to the $687 million of notes scheduled to mature in 2007. Dividends paid to stockholders were $420 million in 2006, $387 million in 2005 and $349 million in 2004. Our quarterly dividend rate was $0.24 per share in 2006, versus $0.22 in 2005 and $0.20 in 2004. Although we do not have a formal dividend policy, management believes that a reasonable dividend payout ratio based on the current industry environment and market conditions is approximately one third of our economic earnings (income excluding the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment). Dividends are subject to approval by our Board of Directors. In November 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase, between January 1, 2005 and December 31, 2006, of up to $700 million of our outstanding common stock. In 2006 and 2005, we repurchased 6.0 million shares of common stock for $264 million and 11.2 million shares of common stock for $436 million, respectively, under this program. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2006. In March 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $750 million of our outstanding common stock commencing in 2006. During 2006, we repurchased 1.9 million shares of common stock for $88 million under this program. In December 2006, our Board of Directors, subject to the closing of our sale of Raytheon Aircraft, authorized an increase to our existing repurchase program of up to an additional $750 million of our outstanding common stock. CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND RESOURCES Total debt was $4.0 billion at December 31, 2006 and $4.5 billion at December 31, 2005. Cash and cash equivalents were $2.5 billion at December 31, 2006 and $1.2 billion at December 31, 2005. Our outstanding debt bears interest at fixed interest rates ranging from 4.5% to 8.3% and matures at various dates through 2028. However, we entered into various interest rate swaps that correspond to a portion of our fixed rate debt in order to effectively hedge interest rate risk. The $600 million notional value of interest rate swaps that remained outstanding at December 31, 2006 effectively converted that portion of our total fixed rate debt to variable rate debt based on LIBOR. Total debt as a percentage of total capital was 26.3% and 29.4% at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We have a $2.2 billion bank revolving credit facility under which we can draw down on lines of credit and use the credit facility to support commercial paper or letters of credit that we may issue for short term liquidity. The credit facility matures in March 2010. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest based on LIBOR. As of December 31, 2006 and December 31, 2005, there were no borrowings under our credit facility. We had, however, approximately $70 million and $100 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively, which effectively reduced our borrowing capacity under the credit facility by that same amount at each of the respective dates. Under the credit facility, we must comply with certain covenants, including the ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no more than 50% and the ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to consolidated net interest expense, for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, of no less than 3.0 to 1.0. We were in compliance with the covenants during 2006 and 2005, and expect to continue to be in compliance throughout 2007. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries maintain revolving bank lines of credit to provide them with a limited amount of short term liquidity. In 2005, Raytheon United Kingdom Limited, a U.K. subsidiary, entered into a $150 million committed 49 Table of Contents multicurrency revolving credit facility. There were no borrowings under the facility at December 31, 2006 and $53 million at December 31, 2005. In addition, other uncommitted bank lines totaled $15 million and $6 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. There were no amounts outstanding under these lines of credit at December 31, 2006 and 2005. Compensating balance arrangements are not material. Our credit ratings were assigned by Fitchs at F2 for short term borrowing and BBB for senior debt, by Moodys at P 2 for short term borrowing and Baa2 for senior debt and by Standard and Poors at A 2 for short term borrowing and BBB+ for senior debt. In January 2007, Fitchs raised our credit rating for senior debt to BBB+. In May 2006, we filed a shelf registration with the SEC for the issuance of up to $2.0 billion in debt securities, common or preferred stock and warrants to purchase the aforementioned securities. In June 2006, we used approximately $450 million under the shelf registration to register the common stock to be issued upon the exercise of the warrants issued as part of the settlement of the securities class action lawsuit described in Note 12, Commitments and Contingencies of the Notes to the Financial Statements. At December 31, 2006, our shelf registrations aggregated $5.0 billion of which $3.3 billion remained available. In 2004, in accordance with the terms of the 8.25%, $50 par value equity security units we issued in 2001, we issued 27.0 million shares of common stock and received proceeds of $863 million. Our need for, cost of and access to funds are dependent on future operating results, as well as other external conditions. We expect that cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, proceeds from divestitures and other available financing resources will be sufficient to meet anticipated operating, capital expenditure and debt service requirements during the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into off balance sheet arrangements, including the sale of general aviation receivables. Such arrangements are not material to our overall liquidity or capital resources, market risk support or credit risk support. We also issue guarantees to third parties on behalf of our affiliates as described below in Commitments and Contingencies. In 2006, we sold $67 million of general aviation finance receivables to a qualifying special purpose entity which in turn issued beneficial interests in these receivables to a commercial paper conduit, and retained a subordinated interest in and servicing rights to the receivables. The sale was non recourse to us due to third party financial guarantees. At December 31, 2006 and 2005, the outstanding balance of securitized accounts receivable held by the third party conduit totaled $173 million and $157 million, respectively, of which our subordinated retained interest was $60 million and $59 million, respectively, net, and the fair value of the servicing liability was $1 million and the servicing asset was $2 million, respectively. In 1997, we provided a first loss guarantee of $133 million on $1.3 billion of U.S. Export Import Bank loans (maturing in 2015) to the Brazilian government related to the System for the Vigilance of the Amazon (SIVAM) program being performed by Network Centric Systems. Loan repayments by the Brazilian government were current at December 31, 2006. In addition, we have entered into joint ventures formed specifically to facilitate a teaming arrangement between two contractors for the benefit of the customer, generally the U.S. government, whereby we receive a subcontract from the joint venture in the joint ventures capacity as prime contractor. Accordingly, we record the work it performs for the joint venture as an operating activity. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to remediation of various environmental sites. Our estimate of total environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred is $107 million. Discounted at a weighted average risk free rate of 5.7%, we estimate the liability to be $75 million before U.S. government recovery and had this amount accrued at December 31, 2006. A portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. The recovery of environmental cleanup costs from the U.S. government is considered probable based on government contracting regulations and our long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs. Accordingly, we have recorded $47 million at December 31, 2006 for the estimated future recovery of these costs from the U.S. government, which is included in contracts in process. We lease certain government owned properties and are generally not liable for environmental remediation at these sites; therefore, no provision has been 50 Table of Contents made in the financial statements for these costs. Due to the complexity of environmental laws and regulations, the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup methods and technologies, the uncertainty of insurance coverage and the unresolved extent of our responsibility, it is difficult to determine the ultimate outcome of these matters, however, any additional liability is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. We issue guarantees and have banks and surety companies issue, on our behalf, letters of credit and surety bonds to meet various bid, performance, warranty, retention and advance payment obligations of us or our affiliates. Approximately $311 million, $702 million and $120 million of these guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds, for which there were stated values, were outstanding at December 31, 2006, respectively, and $312 million, $767 million and $78 million were outstanding at December 31, 2005, respectively. These instruments expire on various dates through 2015. Additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no stated value also remain outstanding. Included in guarantees and letters of credit above was $92 million and $157 million at December 31, 2006, respectively and $76 million and $183 million at December 31, 2005, respectively, related to Thales Raytheon Systems (TRS), a joint venture we formed in 2001. TRS has two major operating subsidiaries, one of which we control and consolidate. Our investment in TRS was $150 million at December 31, 2006 and $102 million at December 31, 2005. We provide these guarantees and letters of credit to TRS and other affiliates to assist these entities in connection with obtaining financing on more favorable terms, making bids on contracts and performing their contractual obligations. While we expect these entities to satisfy their loans, project performance and other contractual obligations, their failure to do so may result in a future obligation for us. Also included in guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds above was $83 million, $86 million and $11 million at December 31, 2006, respectively and $94 million, $56 million and $63 million at December 31, 2005, respectively related to discontinued operations. The customers of Flight Options have the contractual ability to require Flight Options to buy back their fractional share based on its current fair market value. The estimated value of this potential obligation was $497 million and $575 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Defense contractors are subject to many levels of audit and investigation. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Department of Defense Inspector General, the Government Accountability Office, the Department of Justice and Congressional Committees. The Department of Justice, from time to time, has convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by the Company. Individually and in the aggregate, these audits and investigations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The following is a schedule of our contractual obligations outstanding at December 31, 2006: (In millions) Total Less than1 Year 13years 45years After 5years Debt(1) $ 4,018 $ 688 $ 309 $ 1,185 $ 1,836 Interest payments 1,922 255 404 295 968 Operating leases 1,179 317 463 227 172 Purchase obligations 7,536 5,344 1,675 307 210 Total $ 14,655 $ 6,604 $ 2,851 $ 2,014 $ 3,186 (1) Debt includes scheduled principal payments only. Purchase obligations in the table above represent agreements with suppliers to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding. We enter into contracts with customers, primarily the U.S. government, which entitles us to full recourse for costs incurred, including purchase obligations, in the event the contract is terminated by the customer for convenience. These purchase obligations are included above notwithstanding the amount for which we are entitled to full recourse from our customers. Interest payments include interest on debt that is redeemable at the option of the Company. 51 Table of Contents We currently estimate that required pension plan cash contributions will be approximately $415 million and discretionary cash contributions will be $400 million in 2007. We made cash contributions of $400 million in January 2007. We expect to contribute approximately $45 million to our other post retirement benefits in 2007. Estimates for 2008 and beyond have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts, which are subject to change with respect to future interest rates, asset returns and pension funding reform. In addition, pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government, therefore, the amounts noted above are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions will have on our liquidity. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Pension Act) was signed into law by President Bush. Under the Pension Act, companies will be required to fully fund their pension plans over a seven year period. For defense contractors, the new funding rules become effective no sooner than 2008 and no later than 2011, depending on when the Cost Accounting Standards Board aligns the Cost Accounting Standards with the new funding requirements. We are currently assessing the Pension Act and its potential impact on pension funding pending further regulations and guidance to be released by the Internal Revenue Service, Department of Labor and Department of Treasury. Effective January 1, 2007, all eligible newly hired or rehired employees participate in a new defined contribution plan in lieu of our existing pension plans, subject to any applicable collective bargaining agreements. Our current eligible employees will continue to participate in our existing pension plans without any changes to level of benefits or payment options. This change is not expected to have a material impact on our estimated pension expense or contributions in 2007. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In February 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 155, Accounting for Certain Hybrid Financial Instruments an amendment of FASB Statements No. 133 and 140 (SFAS No. 155). SFAS No. 155 permits a fair value remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that would otherwise require bifurcation. This accounting standard is effective as of the beginning of fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. The effect, if any, of adopting SFAS No. 155 on our financial position and results of operations is not expected to be material. In March 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 156, Accounting for Servicing of Financial Assets, an amendment of FASB Statement No. 140 (SFAS No. 156). SFAS No. 156 requires that servicing assets and servicing liabilities be recognized at fair value, if practicable, when we enter into a servicing agreement and allows two alternatives, the amortization and fair value measurement methods, as subsequent measurement methods. This accounting standard is effective for all new transactions occurring as of the beginning of fiscal years beginning after September 15, 2006. The effect, if any, of adopting SFAS No. 156 on our financial position and results of operations is not expected to be material. In June 2006, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). FIN 48 clarifies the accounting for uncertainties in income taxes recognized in an enterprises financial statements. FIN 48 requires that we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority. If a tax position meets the more likely than not recognition criteria, FIN 48 requires the tax position be measured at the largest amount of benefit greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. This accounting standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006. The cumulative effect of applying the provisions of this interpretation is required to be reported separately as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption. We expect the impact of its adoption to be a charge of approximately $13 million in 2007. In September 2006, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. This accounting standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The effect, if any, of adopting SFAS No. 157 on our financial position and results of operations has not been finalized. 52 Table of Contents In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statements No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible items at fair value (the fair value option). A business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting period. This accounting standard is effective as of the beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after November 15, 2007. The effect, if any, of adopting SFAS No. 159 on our financial position and results of operations has not been finalized. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market exposures are to interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We meet our working capital requirements with a combination of variable rate short term and fixed rate long term financing. We enter into interest rate swap agreements with commercial and investment banks to manage interest rates associated with our financing arrangements. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts with commercial banks to fix the dollar value of commitments and payments to international vendors and the value of foreign currency denominated receipts. The market risk sensitive instruments we use for hedging are entered into with commercial and investment banks and are directly related to a particular asset, liability or transaction for which a firm commitment is in place. Financial instruments we hold that are subject to interest rate risk include notes payable, long term debt, long term receivables, investments and interest rate swap agreements. The aggregate hypothetical loss in earnings for one year of those financial instruments that we held at December 31, 2006 and 2005, which are subject to interest rate risk resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates of 10%, was approximately $2 million after tax for the year ended December 31, 2006 and 2005. Fixed rate financial instruments were not evaluated, as the risk exposure is not material. We believe our exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates is not material due to our hedging policy and the fact that we do not enter into speculative hedges. 53 Table of Contents
