ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW Introduction Raytheon Company develops technologically advanced, integrated products, services and solutions in four core defense markets: Sensing; Effects; Command, Control, Communications and Intelligence (C3I) and Mission Support. We serve all branches of the U.S. military and numerous other U.S. government agencies, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and many allied governments. We operate in six business segments: Integrated Defense Systems (IDS), Intelligence and Information Systems (IIS), Missile Systems (MS), Network Centric Systems (NCS), Space and Airborne Systems (SAS) and Technical Services (TS). For a more detailed description of our segments, see Business Segments within Item 1 of this Form 10 K. As discussed in more detail below and elsewhere in this Form 10 K, in 2007, we sold Raytheon Aircraft and Flight Options. Accordingly, Raytheon Aircraft and Flight Options are presented as discontinued operations in this Form 10 K. For further information regarding Raytheon Aircraft, Flight Options and our Other Discontinued Operations, see Discontinued Operations below and Note 2: Discontinued Operations within Item 8 of this Form 10 K. In this section, we discuss our industry and how certain factors may affect our business, key elements of our strategy, how our financial performance is assessed and measured by management, and other business considerations, including certain risks and challenges to our business. Next, we discuss our critical accounting estimates, which are those estimates that are most important to both the reporting of our financial condition and results of operations and require managements most difficult or subjective judgment. We then review our 2007 results of operations beginning with an overview of our total company results, followed by a more detailed review of those results by business segment and discontinued operations. We also review our financial condition and liquidity including our capital structure and resources, off balance sheet arrangements, commitments and contingencies, and conclude with a discussion of our exposure to various market risks. Industry Considerations Domestic Considerations U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) funding has grown substantially since 2001. The DoD base budget, which excludes emergency funding for operations in Iraq, Afghanistan, and other activities related to the Global War on Terrorism, has grown from $300 billion in fiscal year (FY) 2001 to $479 billion in FY 2008, or 7% compounded annually. The FY 2008 budget is $48 billion, or 11% more than the FY 2007 level. DoD modernization funding, which consists of procurement and research and development (R&D), is of particular importance to defense contractors. Modernization funding in the base budget has grown at an annual rate of 8% since FY 2001. The FY 2008 modernization level of $176 billion is $16 billion, or 10% more than the FY 2007 level. A major reason for this consistent growth is the need to replace aging inventory of planes, ships, ground combat vehicles and other necessary warfighting equipment, often referred to as recapitalization by DoD officials. The DoD Operations and Maintenance Account (O&M), which includes funding for training, services and other logistical support functions, is the other major account of importance to the defense industry. O&M in the DoD base budget has grown at an annual rate of 6% since FY 2001. The FY 2008 level of $164 billion is $18 billion, or 12% more than the FY 2007 level. The recent decision to increase active duty ground forces by 92,000 will likely increase O&M funding requirements in the near future. Funding for the major operations of the Global War on Terrorism, notably the operations in Afghanistan and Iraq, have largely occurred through emergency supplemental appropriations rather than in the base budget appropriations. These emergency supplemental appropriations have risen from $63 billion in FY 2003 to the Presidents request of $189 billion for FY 2008, or 25% compounded annually. 30 Table of Contents The share of funding devoted to the modernization accounts, primarily procurement, within these emergency supplemental appropriations has steadily grown. Of the Presidents $189 billion request for FY 2008 emergency funding, 40% is for modernization, which is $26 billion, or 52% more than the FY 2007 level. This growth is fueled by a greater need for force protection of the warfighter as well as the growing need to replace or extensively refurbish equipment which is wearing down due to operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. Looking forward, the DoD budget will be affected by several factors, including the following: External threats to our national security, including potential security threats posed by extremist Islamic terrorism and countries such as Iran, North Korea, or a politically unstable Pakistan. Funding for on going operations in Iraq and, to a lesser extent, Afghanistan, which will require funding above and beyond the DoD base budget for their duration. Future priorities of the next Administration which could result in significant changes in the DoD budget overall and how much within that budget is devoted to recapitalization, modernization and other DoD funding priorities beginning with the FY 2010 budget. The overall health of the U.S. and world economies and the U.S. governments finances. Based on the enacted and proposed levels of funding for DoD for FY 2008 and FY 2009, we expect continued defense spending growth in the near term. However, projected defense spending becomes increasingly uncertain beyond that period due to numerous factors, including those noted above. For more information on the risks and uncertainties that could impact the U.S. governments demand for our products and services, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. International Considerations Internationally, the growing threat of additional terrorist activity, emerging nuclear states and conventional military threats have led to an increase in demand for defense products and services and homeland security solutions. We currently anticipate that international defense budgets will grow slightly faster than domestic budgets. International customers are expected to also continue to adopt similar defense transformation initiatives as the DoDs initiatives. We believe that this trend will continue because many international customers are facing the same threat environment changes as the United States and they wish to assure that their forces and systems will be interoperable with U.S. and NATO forces. Certain countries have increased their defense budgets due to strong regional or local economic growth which may allow them to simultaneously undertake domestic infrastructure, defense and homeland security projects. However, international demand is sensitive to changes in the priorities and budgets of international customers, which may be driven by potentially volatile regional and local economic and political factors, as well as U.S. foreign policy. For more information on the risks and uncertainties that could impact international demand for our products and services, see Item 1A Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. Our Strategy and Opportunities The following are the key elements of our strategy: Focus on key strategic pursuits, technology and mission assurance to protect and grow our position in our four core defense markets, Sensing, Effects, C3I and Mission Support. Leverage our domain knowledge in these core defense markets, as well as in Mission Systems Integration, Homeland Security, and Information Assurance/Information Operations. Expand our international business by increasing defense sales and seeking adjacent opportunities. Be a Customer focused company based on performance, relationships, and solutions. Our Core Defense Markets We believe that our technologies, domain knowledge and key capabilities and their alignment with customer needs in our core defense markets position us favorably to continue to grow and increase our market share. Our core markets also serve as a solid base from which to expand into adjacent and emerging markets, such as in Mission Systems Integration, Homeland Security, and Information Assurance/Information Operations. We continually explore opportunities to use our existing capabilities or develop or acquire additional ones to expand into closely adjacent markets. Sensing We are focused on expanding beyond traditional RF (radio frequency)/EO (electro optical) systems and into adjacent markets such as hyperspectral, acoustic and ultraviolet systems and sensors to detect Weapons of Mass 31 Table of Contents Destruction. Our SAS business segment was recently selected to supply Active Electronically Scanned Array (AESA) radars for the Air Forces next generation F 15E Strike Eagle aircraft. In addition, during 2007, our NCS business segment began supplying Thermal Weapon Sights (TWS) that allow individual soldiers to perform surveillance and targeting during day or night, in zero illumination, or in fog, smoke, dust and sand. Using acoustic sensor technologies, our IDS business segment developed the Undersea Coastal Surveillance System (UCSS) and Airborne Low Frequency Sonar (ALFS). IDS is also developing a new Advanced Spectroscopic Portal (ASP) designed to help border authorities scan for nuclear materials. Effects We are also focused on moving beyond kinetic energy weapons to provide a broader range of systems that generate desired effects on an enemy, including using the missile as a node in the network, urban warfare applications, directed energy, lethal and non lethal applications and information operations. Our Effects capabilities include advanced airframes, guidance and navigation systems, high resolution sensors, targeting and netted systems. In 2007, in addition to a number of successful intercepts with Standard Missile 3s, our MS business segment delivered its non lethal Active Denial System 2 to the U.S. Air Force. The Active Denial System is designed to use millimeter wave technology to repel individuals without causing injury and can be used for military or homeland security applications. C3I We are seeking to continue to grow our market presence and expand our knowledge management and discovery capabilities. Our C3I capabilities include situational awareness, persistent surveillance, communications, mission planning, battle management command and control, intelligence and analysis, and integrated ground solutions. In 2007, our NCS business segment was awarded the U.S. Navys Multiband Terminal (NMT) contract to develop and produce an advanced satellite communication system for seamless assured connectivity between a ships or submarines computer network and the Global Information Grid. Mission Support We are focused on enabling customer success through total life cycle support that predicts customer needs, senses potential problems and proactively responds with the most appropriate solutions. Our Mission Support capabilities include technical services, system engineering, logistics, training, operations and maintenance. In 2007, our TS business segment was awarded the Warfighter FOCUS contract to oversee the landmark consolidation of the U.S. Armys live, virtual and constructive training operations and support systems worldwide. Mission Systems Integration We believe that our expanding Mission Systems Integration (MSI) role will be a key differentiator for us. MSI is the integration of multiple systems (e.g., sensors, C3I, effects) to deliver a solution designed to accomplish a specific mission for a customer. MSI requires a thorough understanding of the customers mission, the systems being integrated and the concept of operations. Our customer focus, program execution and the ability of our businesses to effectively work together on broad and complex initiatives are important factors in our ability to continue to expand our MSI role. Examples of our MSI initiatives in 2007 include our continued successful performance on the DDG 1000 program and our successes with intelligence community classified Horizontal Integration opportunities whose aim is to integrate and link mission elements, multiple sources of intelligence, and ultimately all elements of the intelligence community. Homeland Security We also intend to continue to grow our presence in the domestic and international homeland security markets, focusing on transportation security, critical infrastructure protection, energy security, intelligence program support, law enforcement solutions, and emergency preparedness and response. In 2007, our IIS business segment was awarded e Borders, a contract to develop and implement an advanced border control and security program for the U.K. Home Office. Information Assurance/Information Operations In 2008, we established a new product line of cyber operations and information security solutions to address the emerging information assurance and information operations market. We intend to leverage and expand our information assurance capabilities as well as the capabilities of Raytheon Oakley Systems (which we acquired in 2007). International Growth Because of the breadth of our offerings, our systems integration capability and our strong legacy in the international marketplace, we believe that we are well positioned to continue to grow our international business. As discussed under International Considerations, we believe that demand is growing for solutions in air and missile defense, homeland 32 Table of Contents security including border surveillance, air traffic management, precision engagement, naval systems integration and intelligence and surveillance and reconnaissance. In addition, as coalition forces increasingly integrate military operations worldwide, we believe that our leadership in network centric operations will continue to be a key discriminator. In 2007, our international bookings grew from $3.4 billion in 2006 to $6.7 billion in 2007. Notable awards include e Borders, a contract with the U.K. Home Office, and Air Warfare Destroyer, a contract with Australia to design, develop and procure the combat system for the new Hobart Class destroyers. Focus on the Customer and Execution Our customer focus continues to be a critical part of our strategy underpinned by a focus on performance, relationships and solutions. Performance means being able to meet customer commitments and is ensured through strong processes, metrics and oversight. We maintain a process architecture that spans our broad programs and pursuits. It consists of processes such as Integrated Product Development System (IPDS) which assures consistency of evaluation and execution at each step in a programs life cycle. These processes are linked to an array of front end and back end metrics. With this structure, we are able to track results and be alerted to potential issues through numerous oversight mechanisms, including operating reviews and annual operating plan reviews. We are also continuing to build strong customer relationships by listening to customers, working with them as partners and including them on Raytheon Six SigmaTM teams to jointly improve their programs and processes. We are increasingly focused on responding to our customers changing requirements with rapid and effective solutions to real problems. Other Business Considerations We currently are involved in approximately 15,000 contracts. Our largest contract in 2007 was DDG 1000, which accounted for less than 5% of total sales in 2007. We believe that our diverse portfolio of programs and capabilities is well suited to a changing defense environment. However, we face numerous challenges and risks, as discussed below and under Item 1A Risk Factors of this Form 10 K. We remain dependent on the U.S. government for a substantial portion of our business. Sales to the U.S. government may be affected by changes in procurement policies, budget considerations, changing defense requirements and political developments such as changes in Congress and the Administration. The influence of these factors, which are largely beyond our control, could impact our financial position and results of operations. In addition, we operate in highly competitive markets. These markets are becoming increasingly more concentrated in response to the trend of certain customers awarding a smaller number of large multi service contracts and industry consolidation. Additionally, the DoD and international customers are increasingly turning to commercial contractors for IT and other support work. Our future success is dependent on our ability to execute our business strategies. First, we must continue to perform on existing programs, as past performance is an important selection criteria for new competitive awards. Second, we must successfully execute our growth strategies, as discussed above. In order to execute, we must be able to identify the most appropriate opportunities to leverage our capabilities and technologies, as well as emerging customer trends in these markets. We then must successfully develop, market and support new offerings and technologies for those markets which will require the investment of significant financial resources and substantial management attention. We also focus on significant changes in our estimates of contract sales, costs and profits, to assess program performance and the potential impact of such changes on our results of operations. As discussed in greater detail in Critical Accounting Estimates, our method of accounting for our contracts requires that we estimate contract revenues and costs. Due to the size, length of time and nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts, our estimates are complicated and subject to many variables. We review our contract estimates periodically to assess whether revisions are warranted and make revisions and adjustments to our estimates in the ordinary course. Changes in estimates of contract sales, costs and profits are recognized using a cumulative catch up, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts. In addition, given our number of contracts and our accounting methods, we may recognize changes in multiple contracts in a fiscal quarter that, individually, may be 33 Table of Contents significant, but that result, on a net basis, in no impact on our results of operations. Alternatively, we may recognize changes in numerous contracts in a fiscal quarter that, individually, may be immaterial, but that result, collectively, in a significant change to our results of operations. FINANCIAL SUMMARY Management is focused on the following financial indicators: Bookings a forward looking metric that measures the value of new contracts awarded to us during the year. Net Sales a growth metric that measures our revenue for the current year. Operating Profit from Continuing Operations which measures our profit from continuing operations for the year, before interest and taxes. Free Cash Flow a measure of the cash that is generated in a given year that we can use to make strategic investments to grow our business or return to our shareholders. Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) a measure of the efficiency and effectiveness of our use of capital. Considered in the aggregate, we believe these five metrics are strong indicators of our overall performance and our ability to create shareholder value. We feel that these measures are balanced among long term and short term performance, growth and efficiency. We use these and other performance metrics for executive compensation purposes. In addition, we maintain a strong focus on program execution and the prudent management of capital and investments in order to maximize operating profit, cash and continue to improve ROIC. Gross bookings were $25.5 billion in 2007, $22.4 billion in 2006 and $20.8 billion in 2005, resulting in backlog of $36.6 billion, $33.8 billion and $31.5 billion at December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Backlog represents future sales expected to be recognized over the contract period, which is generally the next several years. Depending upon the customer and their funding sources, our orders might be structured as annual follow on contracts, or as one large multi year order or long term award. As a result, period to period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads. Net sales were $21.3 billion in 2007, $19.7 billion in 2006 and $18.5 billion in 2005. Operating income was $2.3 billion in 2007, $1.9 billion in 2006 and $1.6 billion in 2005. Operating income as a percentage of net sales was 10.9%, 9.9% and 8.8% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. Included in operating income was a FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment, described below in Consolidated Results of Operations, of $259 million in 2007, $362 million in 2006 and $448 million of expense in 2005. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $1.2 billion in 2007, $2.5 billion in 2006 and $2.4 billion in 2005. Total debt was $2.3 billion at December 31, 2007 compared to $4.0 billion at December 31, 2006. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements are based on the application of generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) which requires us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes. Future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty. Therefore, the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment. Actual results could differ from those estimates and any such differences may be material to our consolidated financial statements. We believe that the estimates set forth below may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application than our other accounting estimates and represent the critical accounting estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. We believe our judgments related to these accounting estimates are appropriate. However, if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail, the results could be materially different from the amounts recorded. Revenue Recognition The method by which we recognize revenue is determined by the type of contract or arrangement entered into with the customer. Each contract or arrangement we enter into is analyzed to determine which revenue recognition method is appropriate based on the terms and conditions and nature of the contract. The significant estimates considered in recognizing revenue for the types of revenue generating activities we are involved in are described below. We define service revenue as those activities not associated with the design, development or production of tangible 34 Table of Contents assets and the delivery of software code or a specific capability. We also classify contract revenues as product or service depending on the predominant attributes of the relevant underlying contracts. Service revenue represented less than 10% of our total revenues in 2007, 2006 and 2005. Percentage of Completion Accounting We account for our contracts associated with the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex aerospace or electronic equipment and related services, or those otherwise within the scope of Chapter 11 of Accounting Research Bulletin No. 43, Government Contracts (ARB No. 43) or Statement of Position 81 1, Accounting for Performance of Construction Type and Certain Production Type Contracts (SOP 81 1), such as certain cost plus service contracts, using the percentage of completion accounting method. Under this method, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the long term contract. The selection of the method by which to measure such progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. Our analysis of these contracts also contemplates whether contracts should be combined or segmented. The combination of two or more contracts requires significant judgment in determining whether the intent of entering into the contracts was effectively to enter into a single project, which should be combined to reflect an overall profit rate. Additionally, judgment is involved in determining whether a single contract or group of contracts may be segregated based on how the contract was negotiated and the performance criteria. The decision to combine a group of contracts or segment a contract could change the amount of revenue and gross profit recorded in a given period had consideration not been given to these factors. We combine closely related contracts when all the applicable criteria under SOP 81 1 are met. Similarly, we may segment a project, which may consist of a single contract or a group of contracts, with varying rates of profitability, only if all the applicable criteria under SOP 81 1 are met. We generally use the cost to cost measure of progress for all of our long term contracts unless we believe another method more clearly measures progress towards completion of the contract. Under the cost to cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the contract. Contract costs include material, labor and subcontracting costs, as well as an allocation of indirect costs. Revenues, including estimated earned fees or profits, are recorded as costs are incurred. Due to the nature of the work required to be performed on many of our contracts, the estimation of total revenue and cost at completion is complex and subject to many variables. Management must make various assumptions and estimates related to contract deliverables including design requirements, performance of subcontractors, cost and availability of materials, productivity and manufacturing efficiency and labor availability. Incentive and award fees which are generally awarded at the discretion of the customer, as well as penalties related to contract performance, are considered in estimating profit rates. Estimates of award fees are based on actual awards and anticipated performance. Incentive provisions which increase or decrease earnings based solely on a single significant event are generally not recognized until the event occurs. Such incentives and penalties are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. Our claims on contracts are recorded only if it is probable that the claim will result in additional contract revenue and the amounts can be reliably estimated. We have a standard quarterly management process in which management reviews the progress and performance of our significant contracts. As part of this process, management reviews include, but are not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion and the related schedule, identified risks and opportunities and the related changes in revenues and costs. Based on this analysis, any adjustments to revenue, costs of sales, and profit are recorded as necessary in the period in which they become known. Changes in estimates of contract sales, costs and profits are recognized using a cumulative catch up, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods. A significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more of our contracts. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed total estimates of revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period the loss is determined. Other Revenue Methods To a much lesser extent, we also enter into contracts that are not associated with the design, development, manufacture, or modification of complex aerospace or electronic equipment and related services, or not otherwise within the scope of ARB No. 43 or SOP 81 1. We account for those contracts in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commissions Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition (SAB 104), or other relevant revenue recognition accounting literature. Revenue under such contracts is generally recognized upon delivery or as the service is performed. Revenue on 35 Table of Contents contracts to sell software is recognized in accordance with the requirements of Statement of Position 97 2, Software Revenue Recognition. Revenue from non software license fees is recognized over the expected life of the continued involvement with the customer. Royalty revenue is recognized when earned. Revenue generated from fixed price service contracts not associated with the design, development, manufacture or modification of complex aerospace or electronic equipment is recognized as services are rendered once persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, our price is fixed or determinable, and we have determined that collectibility is reasonably assured. We apply the separation guidance in Emerging Issues Task Force 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables (EITF 00 21) for contracts with multiple deliverables. Revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are evaluated to determine if the deliverables should be divided into more than one unit of accounting. For contracts with more than one unit of accounting, we recognize revenue for each deliverable based on the revenue recognition policies discussed above. Other Considerations The majority of our sales are driven by pricing based on costs incurred to produce products or perform services under contracts with the U.S. government. Cost based pricing is determined under the Federal Acquisition Regulations (FAR). The FAR provides guidance on the types of costs that are allowable in establishing prices for goods and services under U.S. government contracts. For example, costs such as those related to charitable contributions, advertising, interest expense and public relations are unallowable. In addition, we may enter into agreements with the U.S. government that address the allowability and allocability of costs to contracts for specific matters. Certain costs incurred in the performance of our U.S. government contracts are required to be recorded under GAAP but are not currently allocable to contracts. Such costs are deferred and primarily include a portion of our environmental expenses, asset retirement obligations, certain restructuring costs, deferred state income tax and workers compensation. These costs are allocated to contracts when they are paid or otherwise agreed. We regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs. This assessment requires us to make assumptions about the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity. If the level of backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs, the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected. Pension and other postretirement costs are allocated to our contracts as allowed costs based upon the U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards (CAS). The CAS requirements for pension and other postretirement costs differ from the financial accounting standards (FAS) requirements under U.S. GAAP. Given the inherent difficulty in matching individual expense and income items between the CAS and FAS requirements to determine specific recoverability, we have not estimated the incremental FAS expense to be recoverable under our expected future contract activity, and therefore have not deferred any FAS expense for pension and other postretirement plans in 2005 2007. This resulted in $259 million, $362 million and $448 million of incremental expense reflected in our results of operations for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, for the difference between CAS and FAS requirements for our pension plans in those years. Pension Costs We have pension plans covering the majority of our employees, including certain employees in foreign countries. The selection of the assumptions used to determine pension expense involves significant judgment. Our long term return on assets (ROA) and discount rate assumptions are the key variables in determining pension expense and the funded status of our pension plans. To develop the long term ROA assumption, we perform periodic studies which consider our asset allocation strategies, recent and anticipated future long term performance of individual asset classes, and the associated risk. The investment policy asset allocation ranges for our domestic plans are as follows: U.S. Equities 35% 65% International Equities 5% 30% Debt Securities 20% 40% Real Estate 2% 7% Other (including private equity and cash) 2% 17% The long term ROA assumption for our domestic pension plans in 2007 was 8.75%, unchanged from 2006. If we significantly changed our investment allocation or strategy, it could change our assumed long term rate of return. 36 Table of Contents An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the expected ROA assumption would increase or decrease our estimated pension expense in 2007 by approximately $30 million. For every 2.5% that the actual domestic pension plan asset return exceeds or is less than the long term ROA assumption for 2007, our estimated pension expense would change by approximately $20 million. The discount rate assumption is determined by using a model consisting of a theoretical bond portfolio for which the timing and amount of cash flows approximates the estimated benefit payments of our pension plans. The discount rate assumption for our domestic pension plans at December 31, 2007, is 6.5%, an increase from 6.0% at December 31, 2006. An increase or decrease of 25 basis points in the discount rate assumption for 2007 would decrease or increase our estimated pension expense for 2007 by approximately $45 million. Other variables that can impact the pension funded status and expense include demographic experience such as the rates of salary increase, retirement, turnover and mortality. In addition, certain pension plans provide a lump sum form of benefit which varies based upon externally determined interest rates. Assumptions for these variables are set based on actual and projected plan experience. Effective December 31, 2005, we updated our mortality assumption for our pension and postretirement benefit programs to a blend of our own historical experience and a table representing broad expectations of U.S. mortality rates to reflect changes in the lifespan of the pension population. This assumption change resulted in an increase in 2006 pension expense of $130 million. In general, we value our pension assets based upon quoted or observable market prices or other standard valuation techniques which generally assume a liquid market. In addition, we estimate the value of certain non readily marketable investments, which are less than 5% of our pension assets at December 31, 2007, based on the most recently available asset data which can be up to three months in arrears. In addition, we have $3.2 billion of deferred losses in our pension and other postretirement benefit plans resulting primarily from differences between actual and assumed asset returns, changes in discount rates, changes in plan provisions and differences between actual and assumed demographic experience. To the extent we continue to have fluctuations in these items we will experience increases or decreases in our funded status and related accrued retiree benefit obligation. For every 25 basis point change in discount rate, our projected benefit obligation for the pension plans as of December 31, 2007, would change by approximately $430 million. In addition, a 1% change in the actual domestic pension plan asset return compared to the long term ROA assumption would change the market value of pension plan assets as of December 31, 2007, by approximately $130 million. The deferred losses are amortized and included in future pension expense over the average employee service period of approximately 11 years. As described in Note 1 to the Financial Statements, we adopted Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 158, Employers Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans an amendment of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Statements No. 87, 88, 106 and 132(R) (SFAS No. 158) for the year ended December 31, 2006, which resulted in a $1.9 billion increase in accrued retiree benefits and other long term liabilities and a corresponding $1.3 billion decrease, net of taxes, in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income in stockholders equity. Impairment of Goodwill We evaluate goodwill for impairment annually during the fourth quarter and in any interim period in which circumstances arise that indicate our goodwill may be impaired. Indicators of impairment include, but are not limited to, the loss of significant business; significant decreases in federal government appropriations or funding for our contracts; or other significant adverse changes in industry or market conditions. No events occurred during the periods presented that indicated the existence of an impairment with respect to our goodwill related to continuing operations. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a discounted cash flow model based on our most recent long range plan and compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit to its net book value, including goodwill. We discount the related cash flow forecasts using the weighted average cost of capital method at the date of evaluation. Preparation of forecasts for use in the long range plan and the selection of the discount rate involve significant judgments that we base primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. Significant changes in these forecasts or the discount rate selected could affect the estimated fair value of one or more of our reporting units and could result in a goodwill impairment charge in a future period. There was no indication of goodwill impairment for continuing operations as a result of our impairment analysis. If we are required to record an impairment charge in the future, it could materially affect our results of operations. 37 Table of Contents CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS In our discussions of comparative results, changes in sales are typically expressed in terms of volume. Volume generally refers to increases (or decreases) in revenues incurred due to varying production activity levels, delivery rates or service levels on individual contracts. Volume changes will typically carry a corresponding margin change based on the profit rate for a particular contract. Segment operating margin reflects the performance on programs and changes in contract mix. In addition, in our discussions of comparative results, changes in segment operating profit rates are typically expressed in terms of volume, as discussed above, or performance. Performance refers to changes in contract profit rates. These changes typically relate to profit recognition associated with revisions to total estimated costs at completion of the contract that reflect improved (or deteriorated) operating or award fee performance on a particular contract. Changes in estimates of contract sales, costs and profits are recognized using a cumulative catch up, which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods. Selected consolidated results were as follows: % of Net Sales (In millions except percentages) 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Net sales $ 21,301 $ 19,707 $ 18,491 Gross margin 4,264 3,730 3,277 20.0 % 18.9 % 17.7 % Administrative and selling expenses 1,434 1,322 1,228 6.7 % 6.7 % 6.6 % Research and development expenses 502 464 430 2.4 % 2.4 % 2.3 % Operating income 2,328 1,944 1,619 10.9 % 9.9 % 8.8 % Interest expense, net 33 197 266 0.2 % 1.0 % 1.4 % Other expense (income), net 70 (44 ) (13 ) 0.3 % 0.2 % 0.1 % Income from continuing operations 1,693 1,187 898 7.9 % 6.0 % 4.9 % Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax 885 96 (27 ) 4.2 % 0.5 % 0.1 % Net income 2,578 1,283 871 12.1 % 6.5 % 4.7 % The increase in sales in 2007 was primarily due to higher sales at Network Centric Systems, Missile Systems and Integrated Defense Systems. The increase in sales in 2006 was primarily due to higher sales at Integrated Defense Systems, Missile Systems and Network Centric Systems. Sales to the U.S. Department of Defense were 81% of sales in 2007, 79% in 2006 and 77% in 2005. Total sales to the U.S. government were 86% of sales in 2007, 86% in 2006 and 85% in 2005. Included in U.S. government sales were foreign military sales through the U.S. government of $1.5 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.1 billion in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. We currently expect defense market trends to continue to positively impact our sales in 2008. However, as discussed above in Industry Considerations, our expectation is based on certain assumptions and estimates regarding factors, such as U.S. government budget and appropriation decisions and geo political events and macroeconomic conditions, which are beyond our control. Total international sales, including foreign military sales, were $4.2 billion or 20% of sales in 2007, $3.7 billion or 19% in 2006 and $3.4 billion or 18% in 2005. Included in gross margin was a FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment of $259 million, $362 million and $448 million of expense in 2007, 2006 and 2005 respectively. The FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment represents the difference between our pension expense or income under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions (SFAS No. 87) and our pension expense under CAS and is reported as a separate line item in our segment results. SFAS No. 87 outlines the methodology used to determine pension expense or income for financial reporting purposes, which is not necessarily indicative of the funding requirements of pension plans that are determined by other factors. CAS prescribe the allocation to and recovery of pension costs on U.S. government contracts and is a major factor in determining pension funding requirements. The results for each segment only include pension expense as determined under CAS that can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. The changes in operating income by segment are described below. The decreases in interest expense, net in 2007 and 2006 were primarily due to a higher average cash balances and lower average outstanding debt. 38 Table of Contents The expense for income taxes differs from the U.S. statutory rate due to the following: 2007 2006 2005 Statutory tax rate 35 % 35 % 35 % Tax settlements and export tax benefit refund claims (9.9 ) Other items, net (1.2 ) (1.3 ) (0.7 ) Effective tax rate 23.9 % 33.7 % 34.3 % The effective tax rate was 23.9% in 2007, 33.7% in 2006 and 34.3% in 2005, reflecting the U.S. statutory rate adjusted for various permanent differences between book and tax reporting. Included in the effective tax rate in 2007 was a $219 million favorable impact primarily related to the resolution of a federal research credit refund claim for the 1984 1990 years and certain export tax benefit refund claims, which reduced the effective tax rate by 9.9%. The effective tax rate in 2007 was also reduced by manufacturing benefits, research credits and Employee Stock Ownership Plan (ESOP) dividend deductions, and was increased by various non deductible expenses. The effective tax rate in 2006 was reduced by export related tax benefits, ESOP dividend deductions, manufacturing benefits and research credits, and was increased by various non deductible expenses. The effective tax rate in 2005 was reduced by export related tax benefits, research credits and ESOP dividend deductions, and was increased by various non deductible expenses. Included in the effective tax rate in 2005 was the impact of the $12 million nondeductible settlement with the SEC, an $18 million accrual related to adjustments resulting from examinations by taxing authorities and other tax issues and a $5 million accrual related to the repatriation of earnings from foreign subsidiaries. The provision for state income taxes has been included in administrative and selling expenses as these costs can generally be recovered through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. Income from continuing operations was $1,693 million or $3.80 per diluted share on 445.7 million average shares outstanding in 2007, $1,187 million or $2.63 per diluted share on 450.9 million average shares outstanding in 2006 and $898 million or $1.98 per diluted share on 453.3 million average shares outstanding in 2005. The increase in continuing operations of $506 million in 2007 compared to 2006 was principally due to the following: operational improvements of $281 million from growth and performance improvements discussed below in Segment Results, $219 million of tax related benefits discussed above, lower net interest expense of $164 million and lower FAS/CAS expense of $103 million offset by higher taxes of $147 million related primarily to our higher income and an increase in other expense of $114 million driven primarily by the loss on our early repurchase of debt. The increase in income from continuing operations of $289 million in 2006 compared to 2005 was primarily due to improved operating results described below in Segment Results. Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax, described below in Discontinued Operations, was $885 million of income or $1.99 per diluted share in 2007, $96 million of income or $0.21 per diluted share in 2006 and $27 million of loss or $0.06 per diluted share in 2005. Net income was $2,578 million or $5.79 per diluted share in 2007, $1,283 million or $2.85 per diluted share in 2006 and $871 million or $1.92 per diluted share in 2005. SEGMENT RESULTS We report our results in the following segments: Integrated Defense Systems, Intelligence and Information Systems, Missile Systems, Network Centric Systems, Space and Airborne Systems and Technical Services. Effective on the date of the sale of Flight Options LLC (FO) in 2007, we reorganized the remaining businesses which we formerly disclosed in the Other category to realign our capabilities and technologies. As discussed below, FO is accounted for as a discontinued operation. Also, our Raytheon Professional Services business was transferred to Technical Services. With the sale of Raytheon Aircraft and FO, we have largely exited the commercial aircraft market and all remaining assets and liabilities associated with the residual commuter aircraft portfolio of Raytheon Airline Aviation Services LLC (RAAS), which currently generates only indidental revenues, were transferred to Corporate. 39 Table of Contents Also, effective January 1, 2007, the composition of Technical Services internal organization was changed to exclude the Media Solutions business, which now reports to Integrated Defense Systems and Space and Airborne Systems. Media Solutions generated inter company revenue primarily from Integrated Defense Systems and Space and Airborne Systems in prior periods. Prior period segment results were revised to reflect these changes.

In 2007, IDS continued to serve as the prime mission systems equipment integrator for all electronic and combat systems of the Zumwalt Class Destroyer program (DDG 1000). IDS also continued to evolve its products and technologies for use in additional markets, such as homeland security. Net Sales. The increase in sales in 2007 of $475 million was primarily due to growth of $183 million on several domestic and international missile defense programs, $137 million on two joint battlefield sensor programs and $104 million on a U.S. Navy combat systems program. The increase in sales in 2006 was primarily attributable to growth on a U.S. Navy combat systems program. The program growth was due to the ramp up of the detail design and integration phase of the program during which we transitioned into the prime contractor role. In addition, sales increased due to growth on certain international missile defense programs. The increases were offset in part by the completion of certain U.S. Navy programs. Operating Income and Margin. The increase in operating income in 2007 of $137 million and margin improvement in 2007 were primarily due to higher volume and program performance improvements of $78 million on several international and domestic missile defense programs, $27 million on a U.S. Navy combat systems program, and $14 million from sales of certain software licenses. The operating margin in 2007 is not expected to be maintained over the longer term due to an expected shift in the mix of international sales, the completion of certain contracts and a successful milestone reached in 2007. The increase in operating margin in 2006 was primarily due to performance improvements from lean manufacturing initiatives on several domestic programs and performance improvements and higher sales volume on certain international programs. Backlog and Bookings. The $1.4 billion increase in backlog and increased bookings in 2007 was mainly due to the Air Warfare Destroyer (AWD) award, a multi year program. In 2007, IDS booked $1.3 billion for the AWD program and $1.3 billion for DDG 1000. IDS also booked $915 million for certain Patriot programs including an international technical support program, an engineering services support program, the Patriot Pure Fleet program, and a Guidance Enhanced Missile Tactical (GEM T) upgrade program. Additionally, IDS booked $298 million on the Ballistic Missile Defense System (BMDS) program, $195 million on the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) radar program, $118 million for the SPY 1 radar on the AEGIS program and $113 million on the Cobra Judy Replacement Mission Equipment (CJRME) program. The decrease in bookings in 2006 was mainly due to the timing of DDG 1000. IDS booked $1.0 billion in 2006 and $1.7 billion in 2005 to continue the Ship System integration and detail design for the DDG 1000. IDS also booked $631 million in 2005 to provide Taiwan with an Early Warning Surveillance Radar System. Backlog remained relatively consistent between 2006 and 2005. 41 Table of Contents Intelligence and Information Systems (IIS) % Change (In millions except percentages) 2007 2006 2005 2007comparedto 2006 2006comparedto 2005 Net Sales $ 2,742 $ 2,560 $ 2,509 7.1 % 2.0 % Operating Income 248 234 229 6.0 % 2.2 % Operating Margin 9.0 % 9.1 % 9.1 % Gross Bookings $ 4,900 $ 2,701 $ 2,537 81.4 % 6.5 % Total Backlog 5,636 3,935 4,077 43.2 % 3.5 % IIS provides integrated ground systems for signal and image intelligence and weather and climate systems, command and control solutions for air/space platforms, operations, maintenance and engineering (OM&E) services, homeland security and information technology solutions. In 2007, IIS continued to grow its business with classified customers while expanding into international markets and other new opportunities. IIS was awarded e Borders, a contract to develop and implement an advanced border control and security program for the U.K. Home Office. IIS is also working with the U.S. Air Force Space and Missile Command to develop a new system design for the next generation Global Positioning System Control Segment (GPS OCX). Net Sales. The increase in sales in 2007 of $182 million was primarily due to $90 million on an advanced border control and security program, increased volume on several programs with the U.S. Air Force and several information technology programs. The increase in sales in 2006 was primarily due to scope expansions and other growth on certain classified programs offset by procurement delays resulting from budget constraints with several classified customers. Operating Income and Margin. The increase in operating income of $14 million in 2007 was primarily due to increased volume partially offset by costs related to the Oakley Networks, Inc. acquisition. Operating income increases in 2006 were primarily due to changes in volume. Backlog and Bookings. The $1.7 billion increase in backlog and increased bookings during the year was mainly due to the e Borders booking, a multi year project. During 2007, IIS booked $1.4 billion for e Borders, $1.4 billion on a number of classified contracts, $781 million on the National Polar orbiting Operational Environmental Satellite System (NPOESS) program and $101 million for the U.S. Air Forces Consolidated Field Service contract to provide global intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance support. The increase in 2006 bookings was primarily due to increased bookings on classified programs. Backlog in 2006 was negatively affected by procurement delays and budget constraints with several classified customers.

In 2007, MS continued to demonstrate its missile defense capability with several significant test successes including three successful launches of the sea based system with Standard Missile 3 and one successful launch of the ground based system that incorporates the Exoatmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV). Net Sales. The increase in sales in 2007 of $490 million was primarily due to $414 million of higher volume on the Standard Missile, Phalanx and Evolved Sea Sparrow (ESSM) programs. The increase in sales in 2006 was primarily due to the ramp up on several development programs including Non Line of Sight Launch System (NLOS) and Standard Missile 6. Sales also increased due to production on Advanced Medium Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM) and Standard Missile 2, which received various international awards in 2006 and Tube launched Optically guided Wire controlled missile (TOW) which returned to full rate production following a gap in 2005. These sales increases were partially offset by lower Paveway guided munitions production and the completion of several classified programs. Operating Income and Margin. The increase in operating income of $62 million in 2007 was primarily due to increased volume. The increase in operating income in 2006 was due to increased sales on several production and development programs. Operating income in 2006 also included an award fee from a successful Standard Missile 3 flight test. Backlog and Bookings. The $125 million decrease in backlog and the $1.1 billion decrease in bookings in 2007 compared to 2006 were primarily driven by certain large development bookings in 2006 described below. In 2007, MS booked $691 million on Standard Missile Development and Production, $283 million for the TOW missiles, $247 million for ESSM Production, a $253 million Tactical Tomahawk award, $237 million for Phalanx Weapons Systems for the U.S. Navy and U.S. Army, $232 million for the design and development of the Mid Range Munition system, $145 million for the production of Enhanced Paveway for an international customer, and $111 million for the production of Javelin for the U.S. Army and U.S. Marines. The $1.5 billion increase in backlog and $2.2 billion increase in bookings in 2006 compared to 2005 was mainly driven by increased bookings in 2006 including $780 million for Kinetic Energy Interceptors (KEI) for additional development for the Missile Defense Agency and $678 million for the EKV contract and $625 million on Standard Missile 3.

In 2007, NCS continued developing and expanding its international business and presence overseas. NCS had key initiatives into adjacent markets including border security, civil communications and first responder interoperability as well as transportation solutions including open road tolling. In addition, NCS was awarded the U.S. Navys Multiband Terminal (NMT) contract to develop and produce an advanced satellite communication system for seamless assured connectivity between a ships or submarines computer network and the Global Information Grid. 43 Table of Contents Net Sales. The increase in sales in 2007 of $603 million was primarily due to $485 million of increased volume on certain U.S. Army programs, including an integrated ground combat surveillance program, a weapon locating radar program, the Improved Target Acquisition System program and a communications program. The increase in sales in 2006 was due to accelerated production on certain contracts at the customers request in support of the Iraqi Freedom campaign mainly in the Combat Systems product line. The increase in sales was also due to the continued ramp up in the Future Combat System Ground Sensor Integrator program (FCS GSI). This growth was partially offset by the continued ramp down on Thermal Weapon Site (TWS) and by a slowing in the secondary air traffic radar market. Operating Income and Margin. The increase in operating income of $127 million and margin improvement in 2007 was primarily due to $98 million of improved program performance and volume on certain U.S. Army programs. The increase in operating income and margin in 2006 was driven by increased volume and continued program performance improvements. Backlog and Bookings. The 2007 backlog and bookings remained relatively consistent with 2006. In 2007, NCS booked $725 million on various U.S. Army programs including the Long Range Advanced Scout Surveillance Systems program, the Firefinder locating radar program, SATCOM on the move systems to the U.S. Army for use on the Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicle, and the Horizontal Technology Integration (HTI) program. NCS also booked $159 million for development work on the U.S. Navy Multiband Terminal (NMT) contract and $121 million on the Commanders Independent Viewers (CIVs) program. The $752 million increase in backlog in 2006 compared to 2005 was mainly driven by certain U.S. Army programs booked in the fourth quarter of 2006. The $339 million increase in bookings in 2006 compared to 2005 was mainly driven by increased bookings in 2006 including $363 million to provide HTI forward looking infrared kits and systems to the U.S. Army and $447 million on two contracts for our Improved Target Acquisition System (ITAS) for the U.S. Army and Marines. In 2005, NCS booked $484 million for the FCS GSI contract.

In 2007, The Boeing Company selected SAS to supply advanced electronically scanned array (AESA) radar systems for the entire fleet of 224 U.S. Air Force F 15E aircraft. SAS was also selected for the U.S. Army common sensor payload program for manned and unmanned aircraft, which covers the integration, production and mission support of airborne electro optical/infrared (EO/IR) sensor payloads for several Army aviation platforms. In addition, SAS expanded its international activity with the award of contracts to deliver 79 radar warning receivers to the Royal Australian Air Force. Net Sales. The decrease in sales in 2007 of $31 million was primarily due to lower volume of $93 million on a sensor program partially offset by higher volume on certain airborne radar and classified programs. The increase in sales in 2006 was primarily due to increased production on a sensor program. Sales also increased due to additional orders for Hunter Strike targeting systems and a follow on contract for International Greek Advanced Self Protection Integrated Suite (ASPIS) electronic warfare products, partially offset by the restructuring of certain space programs. 44 Table of Contents Operating Income and Margin. The decrease in operating income of $44 million in 2007 and the related decline in margin were primarily due to profit adjustments and lower volume on a sensor program and certain classified programs, partially offset by improved program performance on an international aircraft integration program. The decrease in operating margin in 2006 was due to the completion of a number of mature airborne radar production programs which delivered their final product in the first quarter of 2006 and had provided margin improvement in late 2004 and 2005. Backlog and Bookings. The 2007 decrease in backlog of $315 million was primarily due to stop work orders issued on a space classified program. In 2007, SAS booked over $860 million on a number of classified contracts including $381 million on a major classified program in the fourth quarter. SAS also booked $329 million related to a capability for a satellite system. In 2006, SAS booked approximately $1.5 billion on classified contracts compared to $0.9 billion in 2005. The $371 million increase in backlog in 2006 compared to 2005 was mainly due to bookings on space classified programs.

In 2007, TS led a team that secured the Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (FOCUS) contract to consolidate the U.S. Army live, virtual and constructive training operations and support systems worldwide. TS was also selected as the preferred bidder for the Defence Training Rationalisation contract for the U.K. Ministry of Defence, which is expected to enhance TS integrated training capability. In addition, TS was awarded a contract to provide support for the Widebody Airborne Sensor Platform (WASP) data collection on a Missile Defense Agency DC 10, as well as an Anti Terrorism Force Protection (ATFP) Physical Security and Services contract for U.S. Naval facilities which extends TS capabilities into the homeland security market. Net Sales. The increase in sales in 2007 of $21 million was primarily due to higher volume on certain Defense Threat Reduction Agency (DTRA) programs, training, and international programs partially offset by a $113 million decrease at our depot services operation. The increase in sales in 2006 was primarily due to additional deliveries and the ramp up of construction services on certain DTRA programs. This was partially offset by the wind down of three major programs: GUAM, AUTEC and Navy and Marine Corps Intranet (NMCI). Operating Income and Margin. The decrease in operating income of $14 million in 2007 and the related decline in margins were primarily due to decreased volume in our higher margin depot services operation. The decrease in operating margin in 2006 was primarily due to a profit adjustment related to certain program costs which may be deemed unrecoverable. Backlog and Bookings. The increase in backlog and bookings was primarily due to bookings on the U.S. Armys Warfighter Field Operations Customer Support (FOCUS) contract, work for the Department of Energy and the DTRA. TS booked $492 million on work for the Department of Energy and the DTRA and $118 million on the FOCUS contract in 2007. 45 Table of Contents In 2006, TS booked $198 million for the Nuclear Weapons Safety and Security (NWSS) program. Backlog remained relatively consistent between 2006 and 2005. DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS Income (loss) from discontinued operations consisted of the following results from Raytheon Aircraft and Flight Options, and Raytheon Engineers & Constructors and Aircraft Integration Systems (Other Discontinued Operations): Pretax After tax (In millions) 2007 2006 2005 2007 2006 2005 Gain on sale of Raytheon Aircraft $ 1,598 $ $ $ 986 $ $ Raytheon Aircraft discontinued operations 45 274 187 30 181 124 Loss on sale of Flight Options (73 ) (44 ) Flight Options discontinued operations (112 ) (103 ) (113 ) (88 ) (80 ) (80 ) Other Discontinued Operations 8 (7 ) (74 ) 1 (5 ) (71 ) Total $ 1,466 $ 164 $ $ 885 $ 96 $ (27 ) Raytheon Aircraft In 2007, we completed the sale of Raytheon Aircraft to Hawker Beechcraft Inc., a new company formed by GS Capital Partners, an affiliate of Goldman Sachs, and Onex Partners, for $3,318 million in gross proceeds, which resulted in net proceeds of $3,117 million. The primary difference between the gross and net proceeds was a $131 million final purchase price adjustment for cash retained by us through the closing of the transaction. We recorded a gain on sale in 2007 of $986 million, net of $612 million of federal, foreign and state taxes. We retained certain assets and liabilities of Raytheon Aircraft after the sale. At December 31, 2007, $61 million was included in non current assets related to a residual interest in certain receivables sold by Raytheon Aircraft through 2006 and $32 million was included in current liabilities related to certain environmental and product liabilities. Any future income statement and cash flow activity related to these retained assets and liabilities will be included in discontinued operations. We also retained certain U.K. pension assets and obligations for a limited number of U.K. pension plan participants. The related pension assets and obligations are included in our pension disclosures. Flight Options As a result of the decision to sell Flight Options LLC (FO) and the subsequent sale in November 2007, we recorded charges in the third and fourth quarters of 2007 totaling $157 million pretax, $113 million after tax. These charges are included in discontinued operations and described in further detail below. In connection with the sale, we recorded a note receivable for $9 million and retained certain liabilities, primarily consisting of aircraft lease obligations of $23 million. Any future income statement and cash flow activity related to these retained liabilities will be included in discontinued operations. In the third quarter of 2007 in connection with our on going evaluation of our long term strategy regarding FO, we sought and received a number of initial bids to purchase the business. These initial bids were below our previous estimates of FOs fair value, which was based upon its projected discounted cash flows. As a result of receiving these external indications of market value and other conditions and events that occurred during the third quarter of 2007, we evaluated whether FOs long lived assets and its goodwill were impaired. We used the held in use asset recovery model for this evaluation since all the criteria to meet the held for sale accounting treatment had not been met at the end of the third quarter. Based on the results of this analysis, we recorded an impairment charge in the third quarter of 2007 of $84 million pretax, $69 million after tax, which included all of FOs remaining goodwill and a portion of its other intangible assets. In the fourth quarter of 2007, when our Board of Directors approved the sale of FO and we met the held for sale criteria, we recorded a loss on sale of $73 million pretax, $44 million after tax. This additional charge was not recorded until the held for sale accounting treatment was met, as the carrying value of the individual underlying long lived assets was less than or equal to their estimated fair value at the end of the third quarter of 2007. In 2006 and 2005, we recorded goodwill impairment charges of $55 million pretax, $48 million after tax and $22 million pretax, $19 million after tax, respectively. The goodwill impairment charges in 2006 and 2005 were based upon our 46 Table of Contents determination that the fair value of the business was not sufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets, including goodwill. We estimated the fair value of FO using a discounted cash flow methodology based upon the respective FO long range plan and the financial objectives therein. This methodology involved significant judgment regarding FOs projected future cash flows and expected market conditions, and their impact on the selection of the discount rate used in estimating the fair value of FO. The 2005 impairment charge was driven by a downturn revision of FOs then current long range plan as a result of 2005 performance, changes in valuation assumptions and the increase in goodwill as a result of the acquisition of the minority shares. In 2006, FOs cash flows and financial results improved over 2005; however, during 2006 and, in particular, in the fourth quarter, certain unexpected events occurred and conditions arose which negatively impacted the estimated value of the business. In the fourth quarter, FO experienced a significant increase in competition in its fractional share business and its sales forecast became more difficult to predict as a result of the acceleration of a continued shift in customer demand from fractional shares to the less predictable membership card program. During 2006, the business was also negatively affected by the notification of a potential federal excise tax audit and the pilots vote to be represented by a union. As a result of these factors, we increased the discount rate used in determining FOs value from 11% in 2005 to 13% in 2006, which reduced the estimated fair value of FO. The Internal Revenue Service is currently conducting a federal excise tax audit at FO, related to the treatment of certain FO customer fees and charges. We believe that an unfavorable outcome is not probable because, among other reasons, there is a reasonable basis for our position that federal excise tax does not apply to management fees charged to FOs customers and such position is consistent with industry practice. Nevertheless, the ultimate resolution of this matter is uncertain and difficult to predict and an unfavorable outcome could have a material effect on our results of discontinued operations. We have retained this and other tax obligations incurred prior to the sale of FO. Other Discontinued Operations In 2000, we sold Raytheon Engineers & Constructors to Washington Group International, Inc. (WGI). As a result of WGIs bankruptcy, we were required to perform various contract and lease obligations under letters of credit, surety bonds and guarantees (Support Agreements) that it had provided to project owners and other parties. We have since settled many of those Support Agreement obligations. For the remaining Support Agreement obligations, we have various risks and exposures, including warranty close out, various liquidated damages issues and potential adverse claims resolution. In 2005, we recorded an after tax charge of $23 million for an estimated liability for foreign tax related matters. In 2002, we sold Aircraft Integration Systems (AIS) for $1,123 million, net, subject to purchase price adjustments. As part of the transaction, we retained the responsibility for performance of the Boeing Business Jet (BBJ) program and retained certain assets related to the BBJ program, which is now essentially complete. In January 2006, a dispute regarding the AIS purchase price was resolved in arbitration and we recorded a pretax charge of $26 million in 2005 related to this settlement. In the first quarter of 2006, all liabilities related to the purchase price dispute were discharged. FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY We pursue a capital deployment strategy that balances funding for growing our business, including capital expenditures, acquisitions and research and development, managing our balance sheet, including debt repayments and pension contributions, and returning cash to our shareholders, including dividend payments and stock repurchases, as outlined below. Our need for, cost of and access to funds are dependent on future operating results, as well as other external conditions. We expect that cash and cash equivalents, cash flow from operations, proceeds from divestitures and other available financing resources will be sufficient to meet anticipated operating, capital expenditure, investments, debt service and other financing requirements during the next twelve months and for the foreseeable future. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,198 million in 2007 compared to $2,743 million in 2006 and $2,515 million in 2005. Net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations was $1,249 million in 2007 compared to $2,477 million in 2006 and $2,352 million in 2005. The decrease of $1,545 million in net cash provided by operating activities in 2007 was primarily due to higher pension contributions of $1,318 million in 2007 compared to $561 million in 2006 and higher net cash tax payments. Total federal and foreign tax payments, net of refunds, were $734 million in 2007 compared to $375 million in 2006 and $56 million in 2005. Net tax payments in 2007 included $631 million of payments related to the sale of Raytheon Aircraft and refunds of $381 million related to a federal research credit claim and export tax benefit claims. Federal and foreign tax payments for 2008 are expected to approximate $660 million. 47 Table of Contents We make both discretionary and required contributions to our pension plans. As discretionary contributions are made, a funding credit is accumulated which can be used to offset future calculated required contributions. The funding credit for our pension plans was $1.8 billion at December 31, 2007. Discretionary contributions in 2007 were significantly higher than in 2006 due to the acceleration of a planned 2008 contribution of $500 million into December 2007. We expect to make required contributions to our pension plans of approximately $535 million in 2008. We will continue to periodically evaluate whether to make additional discretionary contributions. There was no origination of long term aircraft financing receivables in 2007, compared to $8 million in 2006 and $23 million in 2005. Collection of financing receivables not sold was $88 million in 2007, $123 million in 2006 and $128 million in 2005. As a result of our sale of Raytheon Aircraft and Flight Options in 2007, we do not expect to originate any significant long term aircraft financing receivables in the future, however, we continue to hold long term financing receivables as part of our commuter aircraft portfolio. In 2006, we received proceeds of $53 million related to the sale of certain finance receivables. Investing Activities Net cash provided by investing activities was $2,507 million in 2007 compared to net cash used in investing activities of $451 million in 2006 and $436 million in 2005. Capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment were $313 million in 2007, $294 million in 2006 and $296 million in 2005. Capitalized expenditures for internal use software were $85 million in 2007, $77 million in 2006 and $73 million in 2005. We expect our capital and internal use software expenditures to be approximately $360 million and $90 million, respectively, in 2008, consistent with the anticipated growth of our business and for specific investments. In pursuing our business strategies, we acquire and make investments in certain businesses that meet strategic and financial criteria and divest of certain non core businesses and investments and assets when appropriate. Acquisitions. In 2007, we acquired Oakley Networks, Inc. and the robotics technologies and capabilities of Sarcos for an aggregate of $211 million, exclusive of retention and management incentive payments for future services. In 2006, we acquired Houston Associates, Inc. and Virtual Technology Corporation for an aggregate of $87 million. In 2005, we paid the third and final installment of $60 million related to our 2003 acquisition of Solipsys Corporation and acquired UTD, Inc. for $39 million. Also in 2005, we acquired the remaining interest in Flight Options for $26 million. Divestitures and sales of other assets. In 2007, we received pretax net proceeds of $3,143 million related to the sales of Raytheon Aircraft and Flight Options. In 2006, we sold our investment in HRL Laboratories, LLC for $28 million and received proceeds of $24 million related to the sale of Space Imaging assets. In 2005, we sold our investment in Indra ATM S.L., a Spanish joint venture, for $59 million. Financing Activities Cash provided by operating activities has been the primary source used to repay debt, pay dividends and repurchase common stock. In 2007, we also used the proceeds from the sale of Raytheon Aircraft. Net cash used in financing activities was $3,510 million in 2007 compared to $1,034 million in 2006 and $1,433 million in 2005. Debt. We made debt repayments of $1,724 million in 2007, $382 million in 2006 and $671 million in 2005. The debt repayments in 2007 consisted of the retirement of $685 million of current maturities and the exercise of our call rights to repurchase, at prices based on fixed spreads to U.S. Treasuries, $1,039 million of our long term debt maturing between 2008 2010 at a loss of $59 million pretax, which is included in other expense (income), net. In 2006, we retired $408 million of subordinated notes payable which had matured, consisting of a payment of $382 million and a reduction in our investment in RC Trust I of $26 million. In 2005, we repaid $671 million of long term debt including the exercise of our call rights to repurchase, at a fixed price, long term debt with a par value of $196 million at a loss of $10 million pretax, which is included in other expense (income), net. Stock Repurchases. We repurchased 28.7 million shares of our common stock under our various repurchase programs for $1,642 million in 2007, 7.9 million shares for $352 million in 2006 and 11.2 million shares in 2005 for $436 million. In October 2007, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional $2.0 billion of our outstanding common stock. As of December 31, 2007 approximately $230 million of stock had been repurchased and approximately $1,770 million remained under this program. In December 2006, our Board of Directors, authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of our outstanding common stock. This program was completed during the fourth quarter of 2007. In March 2006, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $750 million of our outstanding common stock 48 Table of Contents commencing in 2006. This program was completed during the second quarter of 2007. In November 2004, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $700 million of our outstanding common stock. This program was completed during the third quarter of 2006. Dividends. We paid dividends to stockholders of $440 million in 2007, $420 million in 2006 and $387 million in 2005. Our quarterly dividend rate was $0.255 per share in 2007, compared to $0.24 in 2006 and $0.22 in 2005. Although we do not have a formal dividend policy, management believes that a reasonable dividend payout ratio based on the current industry environment and market conditions is approximately one third of our economic earnings (income excluding the FAS/CAS Pension Adjustment). Dividends are subject to quarterly approval by our Board of Directors. CAPITAL RESOURCES Total debt was $2.3 billion at December 31, 2007 and $4.0 billion at December 31, 2006. Our outstanding debt bears interest at fixed interest rates ranging from 4.9% to 7.2% and matures at various dates through 2028. However, we entered into various interest rate swaps that correspond to a portion of our fixed rate debt in order to effectively hedge interest rate risk by converting that portion of our total fixed rate debt to variable rate debt based on LIBOR. The notional value of interest rate swaps outstanding was $575 million at December 31, 2007 and $600 million at December 31, 2006. Total debt as a percentage of total capital was 15.3% and 26.3% at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Cash and cash equivalents. Cash and cash equivalents were $2.7 billion at December 31, 2007 and $2.5 billion at December 31, 2006. Our cash is invested directly in commercial paper of financial institutions and corporations with AA /Aa3 or better long term and A 1+/P 1 short term debt ratings, AAA/Aaa U.S. Treasury money market funds and in interest bearing bank accounts. Credit Facilities. We have a $2.2 billion bank revolving credit facility under which we can draw down on lines of credit and use the credit facility to support letters of credit and commercial paper that we may issue for short term liquidity. The credit facility matures in March 2010. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest based on LIBOR. As of December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, there were no borrowings under the credit facility. We had, however, approximately $60 million and $70 million of outstanding letters of credit at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively, which effectively reduced our borrowing capacity under the credit facility by that same amount at each of the respective dates. Under the credit facility, we must comply with certain covenants, including the ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no more than 50% and the ratio of consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) to consolidated net interest expense, for any period of four consecutive fiscal quarters, of no less than 3.0 to 1.0. We were in compliance with the covenants during 2007 and 2006, and expect to continue to be in compliance throughout 2008. Certain of our foreign subsidiaries maintain revolving bank lines of credit to provide them with a limited amount of short term liquidity. In 2005, Raytheon United Kingdom Limited, a U.K. subsidiary, entered into a $150 million committed multicurrency revolving credit facility. There were no borrowings under the facility at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. In addition, other uncommitted bank lines totaled approximately $15 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006. There were no amounts outstanding under these lines of credit at December 31, 2007 and 2006. Compensating balance arrangements are not material. Credit Ratings. At December 31, 2007, our credit ratings consisted of the following: Fitch Moodys Standard &Poors Short term debt F2 P 2 A 2 Long term senior debt BBB+ Baa1 BBB+ In March 2007, Moodys upgraded our long term senior unsecured debt rating from Baa2 to Baa1 and affirmed our short term debt rating of P 2. In January 2007, Fitch upgraded our long term senior unsecured debt rating from BBB to BBB+ and affirmed our short term debt rating of F2. In December 2006, Standard & Poors upgraded our long term senior unsecured debt rating from BBB to BBB+ and affirmed our short term debt rating of A 2. 49 Table of Contents Shelf Registrations. The remaining capacity on our shelf registrations was $3.3 billion at December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006. In June 2006, we used approximately $450 million under the shelf registration filed in April 2002 to register the common stock underlying the warrants issued as part of the settlement of the securities class action lawsuit. In May 2006, we filed a $2.0 billion shelf registration with the SEC for the issuance of debt securities, common or preferred stock and warrants to purchase the aforementioned securities. OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS We have entered into off balance sheet arrangements, including the sale of general aviation receivables. Such arrangements are not material to our overall liquidity or capital resources, market risk support or credit risk support. We also issue guarantees to third parties on behalf of our affiliates as described below in Commitments and Contingencies. In 2006, we sold $67 million of general aviation finance receivables to a qualifying special purpose entity which in turn issued beneficial interests in these receivables to a commercial paper conduit, and retained a subordinated interest in and servicing rights to the receivables. The sale was non recourse to us due to third party financial guarantees. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the outstanding balance of securitized accounts receivable held by the third party conduit totaled $135 million and $173 million, respectively, of which our subordinated retained interest was $60 million, net, and the fair value of the servicing liability was $1 million in both years. In 1997, we provided a first loss guarantee of $133 million on $1.3 billion of U.S. Export Import Bank loans (maturing in 2015) to the Brazilian government related to the System for the Vigilance of the Amazon (SIVAM) program being performed by Network Centric Systems. Loan repayments by the Brazilian government were current at December 31, 2007. In addition, we have entered into joint ventures formed specifically to facilitate a teaming arrangement between two contractors for the benefit of the customer, generally the U.S. government, whereby we receive a subcontract from the joint venture in the joint ventures capacity as prime contractor. Accordingly, we record the work the joint venture performs as an operating activity. COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES We are involved in various stages of investigation and cleanup related to remediation of various environmental sites. Our estimate of total environmental remediation costs expected to be incurred is $149 million. Discounted at a weighted average risk free rate of 5.7%, we estimate the liability to be $99 million before U.S. government recovery and had this amount accrued at December 31, 2007. A portion of these costs are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government. The recovery of environmental cleanup costs from the U.S. government is considered probable based on government contracting regulations and our long history of receiving reimbursement for such costs. Accordingly, we have recorded $64 million at December 31, 2007 for the estimated future recovery of these costs from the U.S. government, which is included in contracts in process. We lease certain government owned properties and are generally not liable for environmental remediation at these sites; therefore, no provision has been made in the financial statements for these costs. Due to the complexity of environmental laws and regulations, the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup methods and technologies, the uncertainty of insurance coverage and the unresolved extent of our responsibility, it is difficult to determine the ultimate outcome of these matters, however, any additional liability is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. We issue guarantees and have banks and surety companies issue, on our behalf, letters of credit and surety bonds to meet various bid, performance, warranty, retention and advance payment obligations of us or our affiliates. Approximately $261 million, $910 million and $104 million of these guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds, for which there were stated values, were outstanding at December 31, 2007, respectively, and $311 million, $702 million and $120 million were outstanding at December 31, 2006, respectively. These instruments expire on various dates through 2015. Additional guarantees of project performance for which there is no stated value also remain outstanding. Included in guarantees and letters of credit above was $39 million and $193 million at December 31, 2007, respectively and $92 million and $157 million at December 31, 2006, respectively, related to Thales Raytheon Systems Co. Ltd. (TRS), a joint venture we formed in 2001. TRS has two major operating subsidiaries, one of which, Thales Raytheon Systems Co. LLC (TRS LLC), we control and consolidate. Our investment in TRS was $165 million at December 31, 2007 and $150 million at December 31, 2006. 50 Table of Contents We provide these guarantees and letters of credit to TRS and other affiliates to assist these entities in connection with obtaining financing on more favorable terms, making bids on contracts and performing their contractual obligations. While we expect these entities to satisfy their loans, project performance and other contractual obligations, their failure to do so may result in a future obligation for us. Also included in guarantees and letters of credit above was $85 million and $21 million at December 31, 2007, related to discontinued operations. Included in guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds above was $83 million, $92 million and $11 million at December 31, 2006 related to discontinued operations. Our residual commuter aircraft portfolio has exposure to outstanding financing arrangements with the aircraft serving as collateral. We have sold aircraft to thinly capitalized companies whose financial condition could be significantly affected by sustained higher fuel costs, industry consolidation and declining commercial aviation market conditions. At December 31, 2007 and December 31, 2006, our exposure on commuter aircraft assets held as inventory, collateral on notes or as leased assets, was approximately $250 million relating to 156 aircraft and approximately $325 million relating to 192 aircraft, respectively. The valuation of used aircraft in inventories, which are stated at cost, but not in excess of realizable value, requires significant judgment. The valuation of used aircraft is also considered in assessing the realizable value of certain commuter related assets which serve as collateral for the underlying financing arrangements. As part of the assessment of realizable value, we evaluate many factors including current market conditions, future market conditions, the age and condition of the aircraft, and availability levels for the aircraft in the market. The carrying value of commuter aircraft assets assumes an orderly disposition of these assets, consistent with our historical experience and strategy to dispose of these residual assets. If we were to dispose of these assets in an other than orderly disposition or sell the business in its entirety, the value realized would likely be less than the carrying value. Government contractors are subject to many levels of audit and investigation. Agencies that oversee contract performance include: the Defense Contract Audit Agency, the Inspector General of the Department of Defense and other departments and agencies, the Government Accountability Office, the Department of Justice and Congressional Committees. The Department of Justice, from time to time, has convened grand juries to investigate possible irregularities by the Company. Individually and in the aggregate, these audits and investigations are not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The following is a schedule of our contractual obligations outstanding at December 31, 2007: (In millions) Total Less than1 year 13years 45years After5 years Debt(1) $ 2,289 $ $ $ 786 $ 1,503 Interest payments 1,510 138 276 243 853 Operating leases(2) 1,001 292 393 176 140 Purchase obligations 7,604 5,527 1,675 355 47 Total $ 12,404 $ 5,957 $ 2,344 $ 1,560 $ 2,543 (1) Debt includes scheduled principal payments only. (2) Capital lease payments are not material. We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, as of January 1, 2007. As of December 31, 2007, the total amount of net unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions and the accrual for the related interest was $370 million. We are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate when cash settlement, if any, will occur with a tax authority as the timing of examinations and ultimate resolution of those examinations is uncertain. Purchase obligations in the table above represent agreements with suppliers to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding. We enter into contracts with customers, primarily the U.S. government, which entitles us to full recourse for costs incurred, including purchase obligations, in the event the contract is terminated by the customer for convenience. These purchase obligations are included above notwithstanding the amount for which we are entitled to full recourse from our customers. 51 Table of Contents Interest payments include interest on debt that is redeemable at the option of the Company. We currently estimate that required pension plan cash contributions will be approximately $535 million in 2008. We expect to contribute approximately $30 million to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2008. Estimates for 2009 and beyond have not been provided due to the significant uncertainty of these amounts, which are subject to change with respect to future interest rates, asset returns and pension funding reform. In addition, pension contributions are eligible for future recovery through the pricing of products and services to the U.S. government, therefore, the amounts noted above are not necessarily indicative of the impact these contributions will have on our liquidity. In August 2006, the Pension Protection Act of 2006 (the Pension Act) was signed into law by President Bush. Under the Pension Act, companies will be required to fully fund their pension plans over a seven year period. For defense contractors, the new funding rules become effective no sooner than 2009 and no later than 2011, depending on when the U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards Board aligns the U.S. Government Cost Accounting Standards with the new funding requirements. ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In September 2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157). SFAS No. 157 establishes a framework for measuring fair value and requires expanded disclosures regarding fair value measurements. This accounting standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. However, in January 2008, the FASB issued FASB Staff Position FAS 157 b, Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 157 (FSP FAS 157 b). This FSP permits entities to elect to defer the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. We have elected to defer the adoption of SFAS No. 157 for those assets and liabilities included in FSP FAS 157 b. The adoption of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In February 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities, including an amendment of FASB Statement No. 115 (SFAS No. 159). SFAS No. 159 permits entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible items at fair value (the fair value option). A business entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent reporting period. This accounting standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007. The adoption of SFAS No. 159 will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 141 (revised 2007), Business Combinations (SFAS No. 141(R)). SFAS No. 141(R) replaces SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations. SFAS No. 141(R) requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction; requires certain contingent assets and liabilities acquired to be recognized at their fair values on the acquisition date; requires contingent consideration to be recognized at its fair value on the acquisition date and changes in the fair value to be recognized in earnings until settled; requires the expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs; and generally requires the reversals of valuation allowances related to acquired deferred tax assets and changes to acquired income tax uncertainties to also be recognized in earnings. This accounting standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS No. 141(R) to determine the potential impact, if any, the adoption will have on our financial position and results of operations. In December 2007, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements, an amendment of ARB No. 51 (SFAS No. 160). SFAS No. 160 requires the ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent be clearly identified in the consolidated statement of financial position within equity, but separate from the parents equity. This standard also requires the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest be clearly identified and presented on the face of the consolidated statement of income. This accounting standard is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2008. We are currently evaluating the provisions of SFAS No. 160 to determine the potential impact, if any, the adoption will have on our financial position and results of operations. 52 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK Our primary market exposures are to interest rates and foreign exchange rates. We meet our working capital requirements with a combination of variable rate short term and fixed rate long term financing. We enter into interest rate swap agreements with commercial and investment banks to manage interest rates associated with our financing arrangements. We also enter into foreign currency forward contracts with commercial banks to fix the dollar value of commitments and payments to international vendors and the value of foreign currency denominated receipts. The market risk sensitive instruments we use for hedging are entered into with commercial and investment banks and are directly related to a particular asset, liability or transaction for which a firm commitment is in place. In 2007, we changed the presentation of our primary market risk exposures from a sensitivity analysis to tabular presentation. We believe that the tabular presentation provides enhanced quantitative information regarding such exposures. The following tables provide information as of December 31, 2007 and 2006 about our market risk exposure associated with changing interest rates. For long term debt obligations, the table presents principal cash flows by maturity date and average interest rates related to outstanding obligations. For interest rate swaps, the table presents notional principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates. As of December 31, 2007 Principal Payments and Interest Rate Detail by Contractual Maturity Dates (In millions, except percentages) Long Term Debt 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Fair Value Fixed Rate Debt $ 453 $ 333 $ 1,503 $ 2,289 $ 2,446 Average Interest Rate 4.85 % 5.50 % 6.50 % 6.03 % As of December 31, 2006 Principal Payments and Interest Rate Detail by Contractual Maturity Dates (In millions, except percentages) Long Term Debt 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Fair Value Fixed Rate Debt $ 688 $ 309 $ 732 $ 453 $ 1,836 $ 4,018 $ 4,205 Average Interest Rate 6.36 % 6.15 % 7.44 % 4.85 % 6.32 % 6.35 % As of December 31, 2007 Aggregate Notional Amounts Associated with Interest Rate Swaps in Place and Interest Rate Detail by Contractual Maturity Dates (In millions, except percentages) Interest Rate Swaps 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 Thereafter Total Fair Value Fixed to Variable $ 250 $ 325 $ 575 $ 10 Average Pay Rate 4.05 % 4.22 % 4.14 % Average Receive Rate 4.09 % 4.80 % 4.49 % 53 Table of Contents As of December 31, 2006 Aggregate Notional Amounts Associated with Interest Rate Swaps in Place and Interest Rate Detail by Contractual Maturity Dates (In millions, except percentages) Interest Rate Swaps 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Fair Value Fixed to Variable $ 25 $ 250 $ 325 $ 600 $ (16 ) Average Pay Rate 5.13 % 5.08 % 5.05 % 5.06 % Average Receive Rate 3.60 % 4.09 % 4.80 % 4.45 % We also held foreign currency contracts which consisted of the following major currencies at December 31, 2007 and 2006: 2007 2006 (In millions) Buy Sell Buy Sell British Pounds $ 278 $ 400 $ 696 $ 297 Canadian Dollars 240 61 219 41 European Euros 104 7 113 9 Australian Dollars 34 6 34 6 All other 122 4 20 7 Total $ 778 $ 478 $ 1,082 $ 360 Unrealized gains of $52 million were included in non current assets and unrealized losses of $20 million were included in current liabilities at December 31, 2007. The offset to these gains and losses is included in other comprehensive income, net of tax. Gains and losses resulting from these cash flow hedges offset the foreign exchange gains and losses on the underlying assets or liabilities being hedged. We believe our exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates is not material due to our hedging policy. 54 Table of Contents
