Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; the discussion of "Liquidity" under "Liquidity and Capital Resources" has been amended to reflect that Sprint could borrow up to an additional $4 billion at year end 2001 under the most restrictive of its debt covenants. This reflects a correction of the amount stated in the original filing. All other items of the Form 10 K are simply restated herein and have not been amended. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10 K/A Sprint Corporation Part I Item 1. Business The Corporation Sprint Corporation, incorporated in 1938 under the laws of Kansas, is mainly a holding company, with its operations primarily conducted in its subsidiaries. Sprint is a global communications company and a leader in integrating long distance, local service, and wireless communications. Sprint is also one of the largest carriers of Internet traffic using its tier one Internet Protocol network, which provides connectivity to any point on the Internet either through its own network or via direct connections with other backbone providers. Sprint is the nations third largest provider of long distance services and operates nationwide, all digital long distance and tier one Internet protocol networks using fiber optic and electronic technology. In addition, Sprints local division currently serves approximately 8.2 million access lines in 18 states. Sprint also operates a 100% digital personal communications service, or PCS, wireless network in the United States with licenses to provide service nationwide using a single frequency band and a single technology. Sprint owns PCS licenses to provide service to the entire United States population, including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Sprint operates in industries that have been and continue to be subject to consolidation and dynamic change. As part of its overall business strategy, Sprint regularly evaluates opportunities to expand and complement its business and may at any time be discussing or negotiating a transaction that, if consummated, could have a material effect on its business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. In November 1998, Sprints shareholders approved the allocation of all of Sprints assets and liabilities into two groups, the FON Group and the PCS Group, as well as the creation of the FON stock and the PCS stock. In addition, Sprint purchased the remaining ownership interests in Sprint Spectrum Holding Company, L.P. and PhillieCo, L.P. (together, Sprint PCS), other than a minority interest in Cox Communications PCS, L.P. (Cox PCS). Sprint acquired these ownership interests from Tele Communications, Inc. (TCI), Comcast Corporation and Cox Communications, Inc. (the Cable Partners). In exchange, Sprint issued the Cable Partners special low vote PCS shares and warrants to acquire additional PCS shares. Sprint also issued the Cable Partners shares of a new class of preferred stock convertible into PCS shares. The purchase of the Cable Partners interests is referred to as the PCS Restructuring. In the 1999 second quarter, Cox Communications, Inc. exercised a put option requiring Sprint to purchase the remaining 40.8% interest in Cox PCS. Sprint issued additional low vote PCS shares in exchange for this interest. Also in November 1998, Sprint reclassified each of its publicly traded common shares into one share of FON stock and 1/2 share of PCS stock. This recapitalization was tax free to shareholders. In addition, the Class A common shares owned by France Telecom (FT) and Deutsche Telekom AG (DT) were reclassified into shares representing both FON and PCS stock. These transactions are referred to as the Recapitalization. At the end of 2001, FT no longer held FON shares, and DT no longer held either FON or PCS shares. FON common stock and PCS common stock are intended to reflect the financial results and economic value of the FON and PCS Groups. However, they are classes of common stock of Sprint, not of the group they are intended to track. Accordingly, FON and PCS shareholders are subject to the risks related to an equity investment in Sprint and all of Sprints businesses, assets and liabilities. Shares of FON common stock and PCS common stock do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to either group, as Sprint owns all of the assets and liabilities of both of the groups. Sprints Board may, subject to the restrictions in Sprints articles of incorporation, change the allocation of the assets and liabilities that comprise each of the FON Group and the PCS Group without shareholder approval. Operating Segments Sprints business is divided into four lines of business: the global markets division, the local division, the product distribution and directory publishing businesses and the PCS wireless telephony products and services business. The FON Group includes the global markets division, the local division and the product distribution and directory publishing businesses. The FON common stock is intended to reflect the financial results and economic value of the global markets division, the local division and the product distribution and directory publishing businesses. The PCS Group includes the PCS wireless telephony products and services business. The PCS common stock is intended to reflect the financial results and economic value of the PCS wireless telephony products and services business.

Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward looking Information Sprint includes certain estimates, projections and other forward looking statements in its reports, in presentations to analysts and others, and in other publicly available material. Future performance cannot be ensured. Actual results may differ materially from those in the forward looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include: . the effects of vigorous competition in the markets in which Sprint operates; . the costs and business risks associated with providing new services and entering new markets necessary to provide nationwide or global services; . the ability of the PCS Group to continue to grow a significant market presence; . the effects of mergers and consolidations within the telecommunications industry; . the uncertainties related to Sprints strategic investments; . the impact of any unusual items resulting from ongoing evaluations of Sprints business strategies; . the impact of new technologies on Sprints business; . unexpected results of litigation filed against Sprint; . the possibility of one or more of the markets in which Sprint competes being impacted by changes in political, economic or other factors such as monetary policy, legal and regulatory changes including the impact of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (Telecom Act), or other external factors over which Sprint has no control; and . other risks referenced from time to time in Sprints filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The words "estimate," "project," "intend," "expect," "believe" and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are found throughout Managements Discussion and Analysis. The reader should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. Sprint is not obligated to publicly release any revisions to forward looking statements to reflect events after the date of this report or unforeseen events.

In connection with the PCS Restructuring, FT and DT purchased 5.1 million additional PCS shares (pre split basis). 22 At the end of 2001, FT no longer held FON shares, and DT no longer held either FON or PCS shares. Operating Segments Sprints business is divided into four lines of business: the global markets division, the local division, the product distribution and directory publishing businesses and the PCS wireless telephony products and services business. The FON Group includes the global markets division, the local division and the product distribution and directory publishing businesses. The PCS Group includes the PCS wireless telephony products and services business. The FON common stock is intended to reflect the financial results and economic value of the global markets division, the local division and the product distribution and directory publishing businesses. The PCS common stock is intended to reflect the financial results and economic value of the PCS wireless telephony products and services business. Board Discretion Regarding Tracking Stocks FON common stock and PCS common stock are intended to reflect the financial results and economic value of the FON and PCS Groups. However, they are classes of common stock of Sprint, not of the group they are intended to track. Accordingly, FON and PCS shareholders are subject to the risks related to an equity investment in Sprint and all of Sprints businesses, assets and liabilities. Shares of FON common stock and PCS common stock do not represent a direct legal interest in the assets and liabilities allocated to either group, as Sprint owns all of the assets and liabilities of both of the groups. Sprints Board has the discretion to, among other things, make operating and financial decisions that could favor one group over the other and, subject to the restrictions in Sprints articles of incorporation, to change the allocation of the assets and liabilities that comprise each of the FON Group and the PCS Group without stockholder approval. Under the applicable corporate law, Sprints Board owes its fiduciary duties to all of Sprints shareholders and there is no board of directors that owes separate duties to the holders of either the FON common stock or the PCS common stock. The Tracking Stock Policies provide that the Board, in resolving material matters in which the holders of FON common stock and PCS common stock have potentially divergent interests, will act in the best interests of Sprint and all of its common shareholders after giving fair consideration to the potentially divergent interests of the holders of the separate classes of Sprint common stock. These policies may be changed by the Board without shareholder approval. Given the Boards discretion in these matters, it may be difficult to assess the future prospects of each group based on past performance. Critical Accounting Policies The fundamental objective of financial reporting is to provide useful information that allows a reader to comprehend the business activities of Sprint. To aid in that understanding, management has identified Sprints "critical accounting policies". These policies have the potential to have a more significant impact on Sprints financial statements, either because of the significance of the financial statement item to which they relate, or because they require judgment and estimation due to the uncertainty involved in measuring, at a specific point in time, events which are continuous in nature. . Allocation Policies between Tracking Stocks As discussed previously, the FON common stock is intended to reflect the financial results and economic value of the FON Group and the PCS common stock is intended to reflect the financial results and economic value of the PCS Group. The FON common stock and the PCS common stock are both classes of common stock of Sprint, and together, the groups reflect 100% of Sprints business activities. . Allocation policies regarding shared activities are critical to the understanding of Sprints business, as well as the business and results of the FON Group and the PCS Group. The allocation of assets, financial resources and certain costs requires judgment by management and the allocation methods used are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors in its fulfillment of its fiduciary duties to all of Sprints shareholders. These policies are discussed in Part 1, Item 1. Business, Risk Factors Relating to Tracking Stocks, in Part II, Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A), Nonoperating Items, Allocation of Group Financing, as well as in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. . Revenue Recognition Policies As discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Sprint recognizes operating revenues as services are rendered or as products are delivered to customers. In connection with recording revenue, estimates and assumptions are required in determining the expected conversion of the revenue streams to cash collected. The reserve estimation process requires that management make assumptions based on historical results, future expectations, the economic and competitive environment, changes in the credit worthiness of our customers, and other relevant factors. A more detailed discussion of the policies by which Sprint recognizes 23 reserves and adjustments to revenue streams and related reserves and provisions for uncollectible customer accounts is included in our discussion of Segmental Results of Operations within MD&A. . Employee Benefit Plan Assumptions Retirement Benefits are a significant cost of doing business and yet represent obligations that will be settled far in the future. Retirement benefit accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by a company. The accounting requires that management make assumptions regarding such variables as the return on assets, the discount rate, and future health care costs. Changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligations, funding requirements and periodic benefit cost incurred by the company. Sprints policies and key assumptions are included in our discussion of Other Income (Expense), Net within MD&A, as well as in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. . Long lived Asset Recovery Long lived assets, consisting primarily of property, plant and equipment and intangibles, comprise a significant portion of Sprints total assets. Changes in technology or changes in Sprints intended use of these assets may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change. Sprint performs annual internal studies to confirm the appropriateness of estimated economic useful lives for each category of current property, plant and equipment. Additionally, long lived assets, including goodwill and intangibles, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Estimates and assumptions used in both setting depreciable lives and testing for recoverability require both judgment and estimation. Sprints policies regarding accounting for these assets and assessing their recoverability are included in our Discussion of Segmental Results of Operations within MD&A, as well as in Notes 1 and 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. General Overview of the Sprint FON Group Global Markets Division The global markets division provides a broad suite of communications services targeted to domestic business and residential customers, multinational corporations and other communications companies. These services include domestic and international voice; data communications using various protocols such as Internet protocol (IP) and frame relay (a data service that transfers packets of data over Sprints network), and managed network services. In addition, the global markets division is expanding its ability to provide web and applications hosting, consulting services, and colocation services. Through this division Sprint also provides broadband services and digital subscriber line (DSL) services, which enable high speed transmission of data over existing copper telephone lines. The global markets division also includes the operating results of the cable TV service operations of the broadband fixed wireless companies after their 1999 acquisition dates. During 2000, Sprint converted several markets served by Multipoint Multichannel Distribution Services (MMDS) capabilities from cable TV services to high speed data services. MMDS is a fixed wireless network that can be built either using a system of interconnected smaller cells or as a single tower that distributes signals through microwave from a single transmission point to multiple receiving points. The global markets divisions operating results reflect the development costs and the operating revenues and expenses of these broadband fixed wireless services. In the 2001 fourth quarter Sprint announced it would halt further deployment of MMDS services using current direct sight access technology. Current customers will continue to receive service and Sprint will wait for development of second generation technology. Sprint will also pursue alternative strategies for the spectrum leases and licenses. The global markets division also reflects the costs of establishing international IP operations beginning in 2000. This division also includes the FON Groups investments in EarthLink, Inc., an Internet service provider; Call Net, a long distance provider in Canada; Intelig Telecommunicacoes Ltda. (Intelig), a long distance provider in Brazil; and certain other telecommunications investments and ventures. Local Division The local division (LTD) consists mainly of regulated local phone companies serving approximately 8.2 million access lines in 18 states. LTD provides local voice and data services, including DSL, for customers within its franchise territories, access by phone customers and other carriers to LTDs local network, consumer long distance services to customers within its franchise territories, sales of telecommunications equipment, and other long distance services within certain regional calling areas, or LATAs. 24 Product Distribution and Directory Publishing Businesses The product distribution business provides wholesale distribution services of telecommunications products. The directory publishing business publishes and markets white and yellow page phone directories. General Overview of the Sprint PCS Group The PCS Group includes Sprints wireless PCS operations. It operates a 100% digital PCS wireless network in the United States with licenses to provide service nationwide using a single frequency and a single technology. At year end 2001, the PCS Group, together with third party affiliates, operated PCS systems in over 300 metropolitan markets, including the 50 largest U.S. metropolitan areas. The PCS Group has licenses to serve the entire U.S. population including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The PCS Groups service, including third party affiliates, now reaches over 247 million people. The PCS Group provides nationwide service through: . operating its own digital network in major U.S. metropolitan areas, . affiliating with other companies, mainly in and around smaller U.S. metropolitan areas, . roaming on other providers analog cellular networks using multi mode handsets, and . roaming on other providers digital networks that use code division multiple access (CDMA). The PCS Group also provides wholesale PCS services to companies that resell the services to their customers on a retail basis. These companies pay the PCS Group a discounted price for their customers usage, but bear the costs of acquisition and customer service. The PCS Group also includes its investment in Pegaso Telecomunicaciones, S.A. de C.V. (Pegaso), a wireless PCS operation in Mexico, SVC BidCo L.P., a joint venture to acquire wireless spectrum rights, and Virgin Mobile U.S.A., a joint venture to market wireless services. These investments are accounted for using the equity method. The wireless industry, including the PCS Group, typically generates a significantly higher number of subscriber additions and handset sales in the fourth quarter of each year compared to the remaining quarters. This is due to the use of retail distribution, which is dependent on the holiday shopping season; the timing of new products and service introductions; and aggressive marketing and sales promotions. Consolidated Results of Operations Total net operating revenues were as follows: 2001 2000 1999 (millions) FON Group $16,924 $17,688 $17,160 PCS Group 9,725 6,341 3,373 Intergroup eliminations (578) (416) (268) Net operating revenues $26,071 $23,613 $20,265 Income (Loss) from continuing operations was as follows: 2001 2000 1999 (millions) FON Group (146) $ 1,292 $ 1,736 PCS Group (1,249) (1,868) (2,481) Intergroup eliminations (7) Loss from continuing operations (1,402) $ (576) $ (745) Income (loss) from continuing operations as presented in the above table includes the after tax impacts of the one time items discussed in the following paragraphs. In the 2001 fourth quarter, Sprint recorded a one time restructuring charge and asset impairment of $1,136 million representing the termination of Sprint ION, as well as additional steps to reduce overall operating costs. Additionally, in the 2001 fourth quarter, Sprint recorded a one time litigation charge of $15 million. The 2001 one time items also include a write down of the FON Groups equity method investment in Intelig of $157 million which had an other than temporary decline in market value, a loss on the sale of a portion of the FON Groups investment in EarthLink of $8 million, a benefit plan curtailment gain of $75 million and net gains from other investment activities of $9 million. Excluding one time items, loss from continuing operations would have been $170 million. In the 2000 fourth quarter, Sprint completed analyses of the valuation of various FON Group assets and equity method investments resulting from its reassessment of the FON Groups business strategies in response to changes in the overall telecommunications industry. These analyses resulted in one time charges of $152 million primarily related to a write down of goodwill associated with the FON Groups Paranet operations, $87 million for the write down of the FON Groups equity method investment in Call Net, which had an other than temporary decline in market value, and $22 million for the write down of certain FON Group investment securities, which had an other than temporary decline in market value. The 2000 one time items also include charges of $121 million for costs associated with the terminated WorldCom merger, net gains of $44 million from the sale of an independent directory publishing 25 operation and investment activities in the FON Group, and an $18 million gain from the sale of customers and network infrastructure to a PCS third party affiliate. Excluding one time items, loss from continuing operations would have been $256 million. In 1999, one time items include a gain of $35 million from investment activities in the FON Group. Excluding the one time item, loss from continuing operations would have been $780 million. Segmental Results of Operations Sprints business is divided into four lines of business: the global markets division, the local division, the product distribution and directory publishing businesses and the PCS wireless telephony products and services business. The FON Group includes the global markets division, the local division and the product distribution and directory publishing businesses. The PCS Group includes the PCS wireless telephony products and services business. The FON common stock is intended to reflect the financial results and economic value of the global markets division, the local division and the product distribution and directory publishing businesses. The PCS common stock is intended to reflect the financial results and economic value of the PCS wireless telephony products and services business. Global Markets Division 2001 2000 1999 (millions) Net operating revenues Voice $ 6,644 $ 7,094 $ 7,445 Data 1,956 1,937 1,696 Internet 1,003 920 615 Other 313 577 552 Total net operating revenues 9,916 10,528 10,308 Operating expenses Costs of services and products 6,004 5,558 4,947 Selling, general and administrative 2,955 3,026 3,141 Depreciation and amortization 1,318 1,121 1,045 Restructuring and asset impairment 1,688 238 Total operating expenses 11,965 9,943 9,133 Operating income (loss) $(2,049) $ 585 $ 1,175 Operating margin NM 5.6% 11.4% Capital expenditures $ 3,580 $ 2,294 $ 1,774 The global markets division faced significant challenges in 2001. The economic downturn coupled with industry wide pricing pressures and excess capacity contributed to a 6% decline in net operating revenues and an operating loss for the year. In the 2001 fourth quarter, a decision was made to abandon the ION initiative and restructure operations resulting in a $1.7 billion charge. These actions were taken to respond to the unprecedented changes in the industry in an effort to better focus on enterprise data and Internet services and aggressively manage costs. Sprint expects continued downward pressure on revenues in 2002 due to the economy and price competition. Some year over year improvement in operating results is expected from the elimination of ION related costs and other cost reduction efforts. Further improvements in operations are largely dependent on the timing and extent of the economic recovery and the degree of growth achieved in the enterprise data and Internet services markets. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues decreased 6% in 2001 and increased 2% in 2000. Minute growth of 20% in 2001 and 18% in 2000, driven in part by the increase in business minutes sold to the PCS Group, was more than offset by a highly competitive pricing environment, as well as the current economic downturn. The decrease in net operating revenues also reflects year over year declines in dial up Internet service provider related revenues, cable capacity sales, professional services and legacy data services. Voice Revenues Voice revenues decreased 6% in 2001 and 5% in 2000. The 2001 decrease includes a decline in business and consumer voice revenues as a result of a more competitive pricing environment and continued wireless substitution. Business voice revenues also declined in 2001 as the revenue mix shifted toward lower yield customers, including affiliate sales and generally lower market pricing. The 2000 decrease was largely due to a decline in consumer voice revenues as a result of a more competitive pricing environment, lower calling card usage due to the increased use of wireless phones, and reductions in access cost pass throughs resulting from the implementation of the Coalition for Affordable Local and Long Distance Service proposal (CALLS). Data Revenues Data revenues reflect sales of current generation data services including asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) and frame relay services. These revenues were flat in 2001 and increased 14% in 2000. Results in 2001 were flat due to increased sales in ATM being offset by a decline in frame relay. Data revenues in 2001 were generally impacted by aggressive pricing in the marketplace and the current economic downturn. The 2000 increase was largely due to increased sales as a result of an increased emphasis on these services. 26 Internet Revenues Internet revenues increased 9% in 2001 and 50% in 2000. The 2001 increase is a result of growth in dedicated IP, web hosting and security. These gains were partially offset by a decline in dial up Internet service provider related revenues driven by pricing declines with Sprints largest customer for these services. The increase in 2000 was due to strong growth in dial up Internet service provider related revenues and dedicated service revenues. Other Revenues Other revenues decreased 46% in 2001 and increased 5% in 2000. The 2001 decrease reflects a lack of cable capacity sales, as well as declines in professional services and legacy data services. The 2000 increase was due to sales of ownership rights to transoceanic cable capacity and the inclusion of a full year of revenues from the cable TV service operations of the broadband fixed wireless companies purchased in 1999 largely offset by a decline in legacy data services. During the 2001, 2000 and 1999 periods, cable capacity sales and sales of ownership rights to transoceanic cable represented less than 0.2%, 1% and 0.03% of net operating revenues, respectively. These transactions were executed primarily with Global One, and were in accordance with our transition services agreement. Equipment sales completed in each of the periods discussed were routine in nature, were completed to support a customers purchase of related telecommunications services, and represented less than 3%, 6% and 4% of net operating revenues for the 2001, 2000 and 1999 periods, respectively. Revenue Reserves All revenues are recognized when the earnings process is complete in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB101). Significant estimates and assumptions are required, however, to determine the expected conversion of these revenues into cash collected. Because of this, the global markets division recognizes several types of reserves and adjustments against revenue. These reserves include: . billing adjustment reserves for pricing changes and usage disputes with customers (principally related to our business and wholesale customer base), . discount reserves for special pricing agreements and volume based incentives, and . fraud reserves for unauthorized usage. Each of these reserves requires managements judgment and are based on historical trending, industry norms, regulatory decisions and recognition of current market indicators regarding general economic conditions. Costs of Services and Products Costs of services and products include interconnection costs paid to local phone companies, other domestic service providers and foreign phone companies to complete calls made by the divisions domestic customers, costs to operate and maintain the long distance network, costs of equipment, and costs related to the development and deployment of Sprint ION. Costs of services and products increased 8% in 2001 and 12% in 2000. Interconnection costs increased 16% in 2001 and remained flat in 2000. The 2001 increase was primarily due to a corresponding increase in call volumes. Reductions in per minute international access costs as well as domestic access costs offset the impact of increased calling volumes in 2000. The domestic rate reductions were generally due to the FCC mandated access rate reductions that took effect in July 1999, July 2000, and July 2001. The access rate reductions in July 2000 included the implementation of CALLS. All other costs of services and products decreased 5% in 2001 and increased 42% in 2000. The 2001 decrease is related to lower sales of ownership rights to capacity on transoceanic cable offset by increased network costs of the long distance operation and costs associated with Sprint ION. The 2000 increase was largely due to the expansion of Sprint ION business services nationwide and the launch of consumer services in select markets as well as increased sales of ownership rights to capacity on transoceanic cable and growth in data services. Total costs of services and products for global markets division were 60.5% of net operating revenues in 2001, 52.8% in 2000 and 48.0% in 1999. Excluding Sprint ION related costs, total costs of services and products for the global markets division were 58.2% of net operating revenues in 2001, 50.5% in 2000 and 47.6% in 1999. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased 2% in 2001 and 4% in 2000. The 2001 decrease is due to a reduction in advertising and promotion costs in both the consumer and business markets and a strong emphasis on cost control, partly offset by increased marketing and promotions of Internet services and an increase in bad debt expense primarily related to wholesale customers. In addition, 27 SG&A in 2001 was impacted by the one time litigation charge of $24 million. The reserve for bad debts requires managements judgment and is based on customer specific indicators, as well as historical trending, industry norms and recognition of current market indicators about general economic conditions. Bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenues was 3.8% in 2001, 2.6% in 2000 and 2.9% in 1999. Reserve for bad debt as a percent of outstanding accounts receivable was 12.7% in 2001, 10.5% in 2000, and 8.3% in 1999. The 2000 decrease in total SG&A expense is due to a strong emphasis on cost control. Total SG&A expense for the global markets division was 29.8% of net operating revenues in 2001, 28.7% in 2000 and 30.5% in 1999. Excluding Sprint ION related costs, SG&A expense for the global markets division was 28.0% of net operating revenues in 2001, 26.7% in 2000 and 28.1% in 1999. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Estimates and assumptions are used both in setting depreciable lives and testing for recoverability. Assumptions are based on internal studies of use, industry data on lives, recognition of technological advancements and understanding of business strategy. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 18% in 2001 and 7% in 2000. The increases mainly reflect an increased asset base to enhance network reliability, meet increased demand for voice and data related services as well as an increased asset base for growth of IP services and other growth initiatives. Depreciation and amortization expense was 13.3% of net operating revenues in 2001, 10.6% in 2000 and 10.1% in 1999. Excluding Sprint ION related costs, depreciation and amortization expense for the global markets division was 12.1% of net operating revenues in 2001, 9.9% in 2000 and 9.5% in 1999. Restructuring and Asset Impairment In the 2001 fourth quarter, Sprint terminated its efforts to provide its Sprint ION consumer and business offerings and announced a restructuring of the remaining global markets division business. This decision resulted in a one time charge of $1.7 billion associated with asset write offs, termination of supplier agreements, real estate leases, and other contractual obligations, as well as work force reduction severance costs. Local Division 2001 2000 1999 (millions) Net operating revenues Local service $2,939 $2,846 $2,677 Network access 2,032 1,987 1,918 Long distance 731 717 611 Other 545 605 752 Total net operating revenues 6,247 6,155 5,958 Operating expenses Costs of services and products 1,955 1,965 2,016 Selling, general and administrative 1,280 1,288 1,320 Depreciation 1,120 1,139 1,069 Restructuring and asset impairment 109 Total operating expenses 4,464 4,392 4,405 Operating income $1,783 $1,763 $1,553 Operating margin 28.5% 28.6% 26.1% Capital expenditures $1,271 $1,371 $1,354 In 2001, the local division was impacted by the economic slow down and growing competition resulting in a decline in access lines and minutes of use. Despite these pressures on revenue growth, the local division achieved steadily improving operating results by effectively managing costs. In the 2001 fourth quarter, the local division realigned its operations to further reduce costs and increase its effectiveness. These actions resulted in a $109 million charge to operations. Sprint expects that the economy and competition will continue to adversely impact access lines and minutes of use in 2002. However, revenues are expected to improve slightly and operating income is expected to be at a level consistent with 2001. Again, results are dependent on the timing and extent of the economic recovery. Beginning in July 2000, Sprint changed its transfer pricing for certain transactions between FON Group entities to more accurately reflect market pricing. The main effect of this change was a reduction in the local divisions Net Operating Revenues Other Revenues. In addition, Sprints local division transferred a customer service and telemarketing organization to the PCS Group at the beginning of the 2000 second quarter. For comparative purposes, the following discussion of local division results assumes the transfer pricing change and the transfer of the customer service and telemarketing organization occurred at the beginning of 1999. Adjusting for these changes, operating margins would have been 28.5% in 2001, 28.4% in 2000 and 25.7% in 1999. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues increased 2% in 2001 and 5% in 2000. These increases mainly reflect increased special access revenue and increased sales of 28 network based services such as Caller ID and Call Waiting. Sales of network based services and long distance services increased due to strong demand for bundled services which combine local service, network based features and long distance calling. The local division ended 2001 with 8.2 million switched access lines, a decrease of 1% in 2001. Access lines increased 4% in 2000. The decrease in 2001 is driven by the economic slowdown, wireless and cable substitution and losses to competitive local providers. Net operating revenues were $6.2 billion in 2001, $6.1 billion in 2000 and $5.8 billion in 1999. Local Service Revenues Local service revenues, derived from local exchange services, grew 3% in 2001 and 6% in 2000 due to continued demand for network based services as well as increased equipment maintenance revenue. Revenue growth in 2000 also reflects increased revenues from access line growth. Network Access Revenues Network access revenues, derived from long distance phone companies using the local network to complete calls, increased 2% in 2001 and 4% in 2000. These increases mainly reflect strong growth in special access services. Volume growth in both periods was offset by FCC mandated access rate reductions. Revenue growth in 2000 also reflects a 2% increase in minutes of use, however, revenue growth in 2001 is offset by a 3% reduction in minutes of use. Long Distance Revenues Long distance revenues are mainly derived from providing consumer long distance services to customers within Sprints local franchise territories and other long distance services within specified regional calling areas, or LATAs, that are beyond the local calling area. These revenues increased 2% in 2001 and 17% in 2000. These increases reflect the success of bundled services, however, the 2001 growth is offset by a decline in intra LATA long distance services. Other Revenues Other revenues decreased 2% in 2001 and 11% in 2000. These decreases were driven by a decline in equipment sales of 9% in 2001 and 20% in 2000 offset by an increase in colocation and data base revenues. The decreases in equipment sales were a result of both a planned shift in focus to selling higher margin products and the economic slowdown causing a reduction in customer demand for equipment. Revenue Reserves All revenues are recognized when the earnings process is complete in accordance with SAB101. Significant estimates and assumptions are required, however, to determine the expected conversion of these revenues into cash collected. Because of this, the local division recognizes several types of reserves and adjustments against revenues. These reserves include: . billing adjustment reserves for pricing changes, volume discounts and usage disputes with customers (principally related to our business and wholesale customer base), . fraud reserves for unauthorized usage and . return and rebate reserves for equipment sales. Each of these reserves requires managements judgment and is based on historical trending, industry norms, regulatory decisions and recognition of current market indicators about general economic conditions. Costs of Services and Products Costs of services and products include costs to operate and maintain the local network and costs of equipment sales. These costs were flat in 2001 and decreased 1% in 2000. In 2001, declines in equipment sales and the success of cost control initiatives were offset by increases in access expense. The 2000 decrease was due to a decline in equipment sales. Costs of services and products were 31.3% of net operating revenues in 2001, 31.9% in 2000 and 33.8% in 1999. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Despite increases in bad debt expense, SG&A expense remained flat in 2001 and declined 1% in 2000 due to a strong emphasis on cost control. In 2001, a continuing emphasis on cost control, partly offset by an increase in bad debt expense accounted for these expenses being flat. The reserve for bad debts requires managements judgment and is based on historical trending, industry norms and recognition of current market indicators about general economic conditions. Bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenues was 2.5% in 2001, 1.5% in 2000, and 1.1% in 1999. Reserve for bad debt expense as a percent of outstanding accounts receivable was 6.9% in 2001, 4.8% in 2000, and 6.4% in 1999. SG&A expense was 20.4% of net operating revenues in 2001, 21.0% in 2000 and 22.3% in 1999. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Estimates and assumptions are used both in setting depreciable lives and testing for recoverability. Assumptions are based on internal studies of use, industry data on lives, recognition of technological 29 advancements and understanding of business strategy. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 2% in 2001 and increased 7% in 2000. The 2001 decrease is primarily due to a decrease in metallic cable depreciation rates. The decrease is due to metallic cable proving to be adequate in carrying higher bandwidth services such as DSL, thus extending its life. The 2000 increase was mainly due to increased capital expenditures in switching and transport technologies which have shorter asset lives. Depreciation and amortization expense was 18.0% of net operating revenues in 2001, 18.5% in 2000 and 18.2% in 1999. Restructuring and Asset Impairment In the fourth quarter of 2001, Sprint announced plans to take steps to improve its competitive position and reduce operating costs in the business units that comprise its FON Group. These efforts included consolidation and streamlining of marketing and network operations, as well as streamlining of corporate support functions. This decision resulted in a one time charge of $109 million associated with the severance costs of the work force reductions and contractual obligations. Product Distribution and Directory Publishing Businesses 2001 2000 1999 (millions) Net operating revenues $1,762 $1,936 $1,758 Operating expenses Costs of services and products 1,276 1,460 1,345 Selling, general and administrative 174 176 154 Depreciation and amortization 21 16 17 Restructuring charge 7 Total operating expenses 1,478 1,652 1,516 Operating income $ 284 $ 284 $ 242 Operating margin 16.1% 14.7% 13.8% Capital expenditures $ 111 $ 8 $ 36 In 2001, the product distribution business was impacted by the economic slow down. The cut back in capital spending in the telecommunications industry caused a significant reduction in non affiliated sales. Sprint expects the demand for equipment to continue to be soft in 2002. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues decreased 9% in 2001 and increased 10% in 2000. Nonaffiliated revenues accounted for over 60% of revenues in 2001, 2000 and 1999. These revenues decreased 14% in 2001 and increased 11% in 2000. The decrease in 2001 nonaffiliated revenues was mainly due to significant decreases in equipment sales resulting from the economic slowdown causing reduced customer demand for equipment. The increase in nonaffiliated revenues in 2000 was mainly due to the consolidation of a directory publishing partnership. In the second half of 2000, the directory publishing partnership, previously accounted for as an equity method investment, was fully consolidated due to a restructuring in the partnership management. Sales to affiliates were flat in 2001, but increased 8% in 2000 due to changes in the local divisions capital program. Operating Expenses Costs of services and products decreased 13% in 2001 and increased 9% in 2000. The 2001 decrease reflects a decrease in equipment sales. The 2000 increase was due to the consolidation of the directory publishing partnership. SG&A expense decreased 1% in 2001 and increased 14% in 2000. The 2000 increase was due to costs related to the transformation of the product distribution business to a web enabled business as well as the consolidation of the directory publishing partnership. In the fourth quarter of 2001, Sprint announced plans to take steps to improve its competitive position and reduce operating costs in the business units that comprise its FON Group. These efforts included consolidation and streamlining of marketing and network operations, as well as streamlining of corporate support functions. This decision resulted in a charge of $7 million associated with the severance costs of the work force reductions and contractual obligations. PCS Group 2001 2000 1999 (millions) Net operating revenues $ 9,725 $ 6,341 $ 3,373 Operating expenses Costs of services and products 5,295 3,942 3,150 Selling, general and administrative 2,917 2,426 1,937 Depreciation and amortization 2,150 1,877 1,523 Restructuring and asset impairment 10 Merger related costs 24 Total operating expenses 10,372 8,269 6,610 Operating loss $ (647) $(1,928) $(3,237) Loss from continuing operations $(1,249) $(1,868) $(2,481) Capital expenditures $ 3,751 $ 3,047 $ 2,580 In 2001, the PCS Group led the industry in customer growth for the third year in a row resulting in a 53% increase in net operating revenues and a $1.28 billion 30 improvement in operating results. For much of 2001, the impact of the economic downturn had not extended to the wireless industry. However, in the fourth quarter, there were signs of weakening in customer growth for both the wireless industry and the PCS Group. Based on an industry consensus view that about 17 million new wireless subscribers will be added in 2002, Sprint would expect to add about 3 million net customers in 2002 while continuing to focus on profitability. The PCS Group markets its products through multiple distribution channels, including its own retail stores as well as other retail outlets. Equipment sales to one retail chain and the subsequent service revenues generated by sales to its customers accounted for 24% of net operating revenues in 2001 and 2000, and 27% in 1999. Net Operating Revenues 2001 2000 1999 Customers at year end (millions) 13.6 9.5 5.7 Average monthly service revenue per user (ARPU) $ 61 $ 59 $ 58 Net operating revenues include service revenues and sales of handsets and accessory equipment. Service revenues consist of monthly recurring charges, usage charges and activation fees. Service revenues increased 58% in 2001 mainly reflecting an increase in the average number of customers and an increase in ARPU. The improvement in ARPU in 2001 was mainly due to customers subscribing to higher usage service plans, an increase in billed minutes over plan and the implementation of activation charges in the second quarter of 2000. The PCS Group assesses access charges to long distance carriers for the termination of landline originated calls. Though regulations generally entitle a carrier that terminates a call on the behalf of another to be compensated for providing that service, these regulations were developed in a period where services of this nature were provided exclusively by local exchange carriers. Certain long distance carriers have disputed the PCS Groups assessment of these charges as well as the corresponding rate at which the charges were determined. The issue is currently pending before the FCC. Management cannot predict, with certainty, the final outcome of this action, but believes adequate provisions have been recorded in the PCS Groups results of operations. The PCS Group added 4.0 million customers in 2001 to end the year with over 13.6 million customers in more than 300 metropolitan markets nationwide. Service revenues from resale customers declined in 2001 mainly due to the discontinuation of one reseller program, which reduced the reseller customer base by 91,000 to 219,000 in 2001 from 310,000 in 2000. The PCS Group third party affiliates added more than 1.2 million customers in 2001, bringing the total number of customers served on the PCS network, including resale customers, to more than 15.8 million. Service revenues increased 94% in 2000 mainly reflecting an increase in the average number of customers. The PCS Group added 3.8 million customers in 2000 to end the year with over 9.5 million customers in more than 300 metropolitan markets nationwide. The increase in ARPU in 2000 was partly due to the implementation of activation charges in the second quarter. Subscriber revenues were also aided by the increase in resale customers. The companies that the PCS Group serves on a wholesale basis added 238,000 customers in 2000, ending the year with approximately 310,000 customers. In 2001, the customer churn rate improved to 2.6% from 2.8% in 2000 and 3.4% in 1999. The churn rate improved from 1999 through the first half of 2001, reaching as low as 2.2% in the quarter ended June 30, 2001. This improvement reflected expanded network coverage, increased percentage of customers under contract and the success of several customer retention initiatives. The increase in the churn rate for the last half of 2001 resulted from customer fulfillment of contract terms, the softness of the economy, and the impact of a new program targeting sub prime customers. The PCS Group expects customer churn rate to continue to increase during the beginning of 2002, but decline to an annual average of approximately 3%. Revenues from sales of handsets and accessories were approximately 12% of net operating revenues in 2001, 14% in 2000 and 17% in 1999. As part of the PCS Groups marketing plans, handsets are normally sold at prices below the PCS Groups cost. Revenue Reserves All revenues are recognized when the earnings process is complete in accordance with SAB101. Significant estimates and assumptions are required, however, to determine the expected conversion of these revenues into cash collected. Because of this, the PCS Group recognizes several types of reserves and adjustments against revenue. These reserves include: . billing adjustment reserves for disputes with customers, . fraud reserves for unauthorized usage, . access reserves for disputed charges with local exchange carriers and inter exchange carriers, and . return and rebate reserves for equipment sales. 31 Each of these reserves requires managements judgment and are based on historical trending, industry norms, regulatory decisions and recognition of current market indicators about general economic conditions. Operating Expenses Costs of services and products mainly include handset and accessory costs, switch and cell site expenses and other network related costs. These costs increased 34% in 2001 and 25% in 2000 reflecting the significant growth in customers and expanded market coverage, partly offset by a reduction in handset unit costs. SG&A expense mainly includes customer care and marketing costs to promote products and services as well as salary and benefit costs. SG&A expense increased 20% in 2001 and 25% in 2000 reflecting an expanded workforce to support subscriber growth and increased marketing and selling costs. 2001 2000 1999 (millions) Acquisition costs per gross customer addition (CPGA) $340 $370 $450 Monthly cash costs per user (CCPU) $ 33 $ 35 $ 48 CPGA is a measure of the sales and marketing efforts computed as the costs of acquiring a new subscriber, including equipment subsidies and marketing costs divided by handset activations. CPGA improved approximately 7% in 2001 and 19% in 2000. Lower handset unit costs and scale benefits from greater customer additions have contributed to the improvement. CCPU is a measure of the cash costs to operate the business on a per user basis consisting of costs of service revenues, service delivery and other general and administrative costs divided by average subscribers. CCPU improved approximately 6% in 2001 and 27% in 2000. The improvements realized in 2001 were driven by lower network, information technology, and administrative costs partially offset by higher cost of service. The improvements in 2000 reflect successful expense management and scale benefits resulting from the increased customer base. Economic conditions in 2001 required greater scrutiny of bad debt expense. The reserve for bad debts requires judgment and is based on historical trending, industry norms and recognition of current market indicators. Bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenues was constant at 3.9% in 2000 and 2001, and was 5.7% in 1999. Reserve for bad debt as a percent of outstanding accounts receivable was 13.0% in 2001, 11.1% in 2000, and 8.5% in 1999. Estimates and assumptions are used both in setting depreciable lives and testing for recoverability. Assumptions are based on internal studies of use, industry data on lives, recognition of technological advancements and understanding of business strategy. Depreciation and amortization expense consists mainly of depreciation of network assets and amortization of intangible assets. The intangible assets include goodwill, PCS licenses, customer base, microwave relocation costs and assembled workforce. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 15% in 2001 and 23% in 2000 mainly reflecting depreciation of the network assets placed in service during 2001 and 2000. Additionally, the PCS Group increased depreciation of certain network assets in the 2001 first quarter to reflect the accelerated replacement of the assets to accommodate network technology upgrades. In May 2001, a significant portion of the value assigned to acquired customer base became fully amortized which caused a $168 million decrease in 2001 compared to the same 2000 period. The 2000 increase also reflects amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Cox PCS purchase in the 1999 second quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2001, Sprint announced plans to take steps to improve its competitive position and reduce operating costs in the business units that comprise its FON Group. These efforts included consolidation and streamlining of marketing and network operations, as well as streamlining of corporate support functions. The decision to streamline corporate functions resulted in a one time charge of $10 million to PCS Group associated with the severance costs of the work force reductions and contractual obligations. In 2000, operating expenses include a one time charge of $24 million for costs associated with the terminated WorldCom merger. This charge increased the loss from continuing operations by $16 million. In 2000, loss from continuing operations includes a one time gain of $18 million from the sale of customers and network infrastructure to a PCS Group third party affiliate. Employee Benefit Plan Assumptions Significant estimates and assumptions are required in determining the liabilities and costs associated with Sprints pension and other post retirement benefit plans and the results can vary significantly with changes in key assumptions. Sprint works closely with its independent actuary to determine the appropriateness of the various assumptions. Sprint has consistently used benchmark rates tied to high quality investment funds with lives closely matching the pension liability in assessing its assumptions for 32 the applicable discount rate. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on the mix of assets held by the plan and their historical long term rates of return. Reasonable anticipation of future medical care cost trends are also provided by Sprints independent actuary. A more detailed discussion of Sprints policies and status of its plans is included in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Nonoperating Items Interest Expense The effective interest rates in the following table reflect interest expense on long term debt only. Interest costs on short term borrowings classified as long term debt, deferred compensation plans and customer deposits have been excluded so as not to distort the effective interest rates on long term debt. 2001 2000 1999 Effective interest rate on long term debt 6.7% 6.9% 7.0% Sprints effective interest rate on long term debt decreased in 2000 and 2001 due to additional fixed rate debt with lower interest rates and lower interest rates on variable rate debt. Allocation of Group Financing Financing activities for the groups are managed by Sprint on a centralized basis. Debt incurred by Sprint on behalf of the groups is specifically allocated to and reflected in the financial statements of the applicable group. Interest expense is allocated to the PCS Group based on an interest rate that is substantially equal to the rate it would be able to obtain from third parties as a direct or indirect wholly owned Sprint subsidiary, but without the benefit of any guarantee by Sprint or any member of the FON Group. That interest rate is higher than the rate Sprint obtains on borrowings. The difference between Sprints actual interest rate and the rate charged to the PCS Group is reflected as a reduction in the FON Groups interest expense and totaled $288 million in 2001, $237 million in 2000 and $168 million in 1999. These amounts are reflected in the "Intergroup interest charge" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The FON Group earned intergroup interest income and the PCS Group incurred intergroup interest expense of $15 million in 2001, $19 million in 2000 and $20 million in 1999 primarily related to the FON Groups ownership of PCS Group debt securities. Sprint redeemed these securities in the 2001 fourth quarter. As a result of this redemption, the FON Group recognized an $11 million pre tax gain to other non operating income and the PCS Group recorded a $7 million after tax extraordinary loss related to an early redemption premium payment made by the PCS Group to the FON Group. Under Sprints centralized cash management program, one group may advance funds to the other group. These advances are accounted for as short term borrowings between the groups and bear interest at a market rate that is substantially equal to the rate that group would be able to obtain from third parties on a short term basis. The allocation of group financing activities may change at the discretion of the Sprint board and does not require shareholder approval. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense) consisted of the following: 2001 2000 1999 (millions) Dividend and interest income $ 33 $ 30 $ 23 Equity in net losses of affiliates (157) (238) (72) Net losses from investments (188) (102) (15) Gains on sales of other assets 10 92 102 Benefit plan curtailment gain 120 Other, net (1) 1 37 Total $(183) $(217) $ 75 Dividend and interest income for all years reflects dividends earned on cost method investments and interest earned on temporary investments. In 2001, investments accounted for using the equity method mainly consisted of the FON Groups investment in Intelig, a long distance operation in Brazil, and the PCS Groups investment in Pegaso, a wireless PCS operation in Mexico. Pegaso is currently experiencing financial difficulties and is evaluating various restructuring alternatives. In 1999 and 2000, investments accounted for using the equity method also included the FON Groups investments in EarthLink, Inc., an Internet service provider, and Call Net, a long distance provider in Canada. In the first quarter of 2001, Sprint modified its relationship with EarthLink which resulted in its investment in common stock no longer being accounted for using the equity method. In the fourth quarter of 2000, Sprint wrote down its investment in Call Net and is no longer required to recognize any related equity in losses. The 2001 equity in net losses of affiliates decreased due to fewer equity losses following the write down of the investments in Call Net and Intelig. These decreases were partially offset by increased Pegaso losses. The 2000 increase is mainly due to increased Intelig losses and losses from Pegaso after the PCS Groups 2000 second quarter initial investment. Net losses from investments in 2001 mainly include a $162 million write down of an equity investment in 33 Intelig and a $25 million loss on the partial sale of EarthLink shares. The 2000 loss includes an $87 million write down of an equity investment in Call Net, and a $35 million write down of warrants held in Purchase Pro.com. The 1999 loss includes a $102 million write down of an investment in Iridium partially offset by a $90 million gain on sale of AOL Time Warner stock. Gains on sales of other assets in 2001 resulted from the sale of PCS customers to a PCS third party affiliate. The 2000 gains include the sale of an independent publishing operation and the sale of certain wireless customers and associated network infrastructure. The 1999 gains include a gain on the sale of an investment security and a gain on the sale of network infrastructure. The benefit plan curtailment gain in 2001 resulted from an amendment of certain medical retirement plan benefits. Income Taxes Sprints consolidated effective tax rates were 30.8% in 2001, 17.9% in 2000 and 30.5% in 1999. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the differences that caused the effective income tax rates to vary from the statutory federal rate for income taxes related to continuing operations. Discontinued Operation, Net In the 2000 first quarter, Sprint sold its interest in Global One to France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom AG. Sprint received $1.1 billion in cash and was repaid $276 million for advances for its entire stake in Global One. As a result of Sprints sale of its interest in Global One, Sprints gain on sale and its equity share of the results of Global One have been reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. In 2000, Sprint recorded an after tax gain related to the sale of its interest in Global One of $675 million. Sprint recorded after tax losses related to Global One of $130 million in 1999. Extraordinary Items, Net In 2001, Sprint redeemed, before scheduled maturities, $18 million of debt allocated to the FON Group and $558 million of debt allocated to the PCS Group. These borrowings had interest rates ranging from 9.9% to 12.5%. This resulted in a $1 million after tax extraordinary loss for Sprint. In 2000, Sprint redeemed, before scheduled maturities, $25 million of debt allocated to the FON Group and $127 million of debt allocated to the PCS Group. These borrowings had interest rates ranging from 7.8% to 9.7%. This resulted in a $4 million after tax extraordinary loss for Sprint. In 1999, Sprint redeemed, before scheduled maturities, $575 million of the broadband fixed wireless companies debt assumed by the FON Group and $2.2 billion of revolving credit facilities and other borrowings allocated to the PCS Group. These borrowings had interest rates ranging from 5.6% to 14.5%. This resulted in a $60 million after tax extraordinary loss for Sprint. Financial Condition 2001 2000 (millions) FON Group $24,164 $24,089 PCS Group 22,190 19,763 Intergroup eliminations (561) (784) Consolidated assets $45,793 $43,068 Sprints consolidated assets increased $2.7 billion in 2001. Net property, plant and equipment increased $3.7 billion reflecting capital expenditures to support the PCS network expansion and fill in, the build out of the IP network, and long distance and local network enhancements, partly offset by depreciation and network asset sales. Investments in affiliates decreased $319 million, mainly reflecting equity in net losses of those affiliates and the write down of certain equity method investments. The rating agencies generally give some form of equity treatment for equity unit notes in determining debt to total capital ratios. The Sprint debt to total capital ratio was 59.9% at year end 2001 versus 57.3% at year end 2000, assuming that the Sprint equity unit notes are treated as 80% equity and 20% debt. Accordingly, the debt to total capital ratio for Sprint is calculated defining "debt" as short term borrowings, long term debt, capital lease obligations and 20% of the equity unit notes value. Total capital is defined as "debt", plus the remaining 80% of the equity unit notes value, redeemable preferred stock and total shareholders equity. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for more information about changes in Sprints Consolidated Balance Sheets. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sprints Board exercises discretion regarding the liquidity and capital resource needs of each group. This includes the ability to prioritize the use of capital and debt capacity, to determine cash management policies and to make decisions regarding the timing and amount of capital expenditures. The actions of the Board of Directors are subject to its fiduciary duties to all shareholders of Sprint and not just to the holders of a particular class of common stock. Given the Boards discretion in these matters, it may be difficult to assess each groups liquidity and capital resource needs and future prospects based on past performance. 34 Operating Activities 2001 2000 1999 (millions) FON Group $4,585 $4,305 $ 3,700 PCS Group 106 (8) (1,692) Intergroup eliminations (69) Cash flows provided by operating activities $4,691 $4,297 $ 1,939 Operating cash flows increased $394 million in 2001 and $2.4 billion in 2000. The 2001 increase reflects improved operating results in the PCS Group partly offset by a decline in FON Group operating results. The 2001 increase also reflects decreases in working capital requirements in the FON Group partly offset by increases in working capital requirements in the PCS Group. The decrease in FON Group working capital requirements was caused primarily by the reduction in accounts receivable which resulted from the global markets division revenue decline and increased billing adjustments, bad debt and cash collections. Also causing the decrease was accrued restructuring costs not paid at year end 2001. The increase in PCS Group working capital requirements was caused primarily by the increase in accounts receivable, which resulted mainly from larger revenues associated with subscriber growth. The 2000 increase in operating cash flows reflects decreases in working capital requirements in both the FON Group and the PCS Group and improved operating results of the PCS Group. The 2000 decrease in working capital requirements was caused primarily by increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities associated with purchases of equipment to support subscriber growth and the adoption of SAB101. These increases more than offset increases in accounts receivable and inventories associated with subscriber growth. Investing Activities 2001 2000 1999 (millions) FON Group $(5,036) $(3,335) $(4,336) PCS Group (3,742) (3,054) (2,509) Intergroup eliminations (299) Cash flows used by investing activities $(8,778) $(6,389) $(7,144) The FON Groups capital expenditures totaled $5.3 billion in 2001, $4.1 billion in 2000 and $3.5 billion in 1999. Global markets division capital expenditures were incurred mainly to enhance network reliability, meet increased demand for voice and data related services, upgrade capabilities for providing new products and services and to continue development and hardware deployment of Sprint ION before the termination of this initiative. The local division incurred capital expenditures to accommodate voice grade equivalent growth, expand capabilities for providing enhanced services and continue the build out of high speed DSL services. Other FON Group capital expenditures were incurred mainly for Sprints World Headquarters Campus. PCS Group capital expenditures, totaling $3.8 billion in 2001, $3.0 billion in 2000 and $2.6 billion in 1999, were incurred to support the continued PCS network expansion and fill in. The 2001 amount also includes approximately $600 million of expenditures related to deployment of 3G technology which is expected to be operational in the middle of 2002. Investing activities also include proceeds from sales of other assets totaling $301 million in 2001, $258 million in 2000 and $243 million in 1999. In 2000, investing activities also include $1.4 billion of proceeds from the sale of the FON Groups interest in Global One. In 1999, Sprint purchased several broadband fixed wireless companies for $618 million excluding assumed debt. "Investments in and loans to affiliates, net" were $66 million in 2001, $889 million in 2000 and $135 million in 1999. These amounts were mainly for investments in EarthLink, Intelig and Pegaso. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on investments. Financing Activities 2001 2000 1999 (millions) FON Group $ 463 $ (952) $ 308 PCS Group 3,698 3,163 4,044 Intergroup eliminations 368 Cash flows provided by financing activities $4,161 $2,211 $4,720 Financing activities reflect net borrowings of $4.0 billion in 2001, $2.3 billion in 2000 and $4.0 billion in 1999. Financing activities also reflect net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $608 million in 2001, $269 million in 2000 and $957 million in 1999. Proceeds from these borrowings and common stock issuances were used mainly to fund capital investments and working capital requirements. Sprint paid dividends of $451 million in 2001, $448 million in 2000 and $441 million in 1999. Also included in financing activities are proceeds from Sprints employee stock purchase plan of $108 million in 2001, $182 million in 2000 and $136 million in 1999. Capital Requirements Sprints 2002 investing activities, mainly consisting of capital expenditures and investments in affiliates, are expected to total $6.4 billion. This excludes any funding for NextWave spectrum, as the company 35 believes this auction will be either significantly delayed or terminated. FON Group capital expenditures are expected to be $3.0 billion. PCS Group capital expenditures are expected to be $3.4 billion. Sprint continues to review capital expenditure requirements closely and will adjust spending and capital investment in concert with growth. Investments in affiliates are expected to be less than $50 million. Dividend payments are expected to approximate $459 million in 2002. After considering cash generated from operations, our incremental cash needs in 2002 are expected to be $1.0 billion. In connection with the PCS Restructuring, Sprint adopted a tax sharing agreement providing for the allocation of income taxes between the FON Group and the PCS Group. That agreement expired with the 2001 tax year, and Sprint has adopted a continuation of that tax sharing arrangement except for the elimination of provisions addressing certain types of acquisitions or restructurings, which never became operable under the original arrangement. Sprint expects the FON Group to continue to make significant payments to the PCS Group under this arrangement because of expected PCS Group operating losses in the near future and from using the PCS Groups net operating loss carryforwards. These payments reflect the PCS Groups incremental cumulative effect on Sprints consolidated federal and state tax liability and tax credit position. The PCS Group received payments from the FON Group totaling $292 million in 2001, $872 million in 2000, and $764 million in 1999. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Allocation of Federal and State Income Taxes, for more details. Liquidity Sprint currently uses commercial paper to fund most of its short term working capital needs. Sprint also uses the long term bond market as well as other debt markets to fund its needs. Sprint intends to continue borrowing funds through the U.S. and international money and capital markets and bank credit markets to fund capital expenditures and operating and working capital requirements. Sprint currently has revolving credit facilities with syndicates of domestic and international banks totaling $5 billion; $3 billion of which is a 364 day facility, expiring in August 2002, and $2 billion of which is a five year facility expiring in August 2003. These facilities are unused, however, Sprints commercial paper borrowings are supported by these revolving credit facilities. Certain other notes payable relate to a separate revolving credit facility of $500 million which expires in December 2002. At year end 2001, Sprint had total unused lines of credit of $1.9 billion assuming Sprints commercial paper borrowings as outstanding on these credit facilities. In addition, Sprint had standby letters of credit serving as a backup to various obligations totaling $133 million at year end 2001. Any borrowings Sprint may incur are ultimately limited by certain debt covenants. Sprint could borrow up to an additional $4 billion at year end 2001 under the most restrictive of its debt covenants. Sprint is currently in compliance with all debt covenants associated with its borrowings. In March 2002, Sprint signed a commitment letter for a $1 billion term loan facility. This commitment, which is fully incremental to the $5 billion revolving credit facilities, is for a nine month loan secured by the assets of Sprints directory publishing business. This term loan facility is expected to fully fund Sprints 2002 incremental cash needs. In the 2001 fourth quarter, Sprint issued $1.75 billion of debt securities through a private debt placement. These borrowings have an interest rate of 6.0% and mature in 2007. The proceeds were allocated to both the FON and PCS Groups and used to repay debt and to fund capital investments and working capital requirements. As a condition to the sale of these securities, Sprint agreed to conduct an exchange offer that allowed the original securities to be exchanged for substantially identical securities that are registered with the SEC. The exchange offer terminated on February 21, 2002. In the 2001 third quarter, Sprint completed a registered offering of 23.5 million shares of its Series 1 PCS common stock. Net proceeds from the issuance were approximately $561 million after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses. The proceeds were used to repay debt, and to fund capital investments and working capital requirements. In the 2001 third quarter, Sprint completed a registered offering of 69 million equity units, each with a stated amount of $25. Net proceeds from the issuance were approximately $1.7 billion after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses. The proceeds were allocated to the PCS Group and used to repay debt, and to fund capital investments and working capital requirements. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, "Equity Unit Offering" for a more detailed description of the equity units. In the 2001 first quarter, Sprint issued $2.4 billion of debt securities. Sprint had $2 billion of unissued securities under its existing shelf registration statement with the SEC, and registered an additional $400 million before the issuance. These borrowings have interest rates ranging from 7.1% to 7.6% and mature in 2006 and 2011. The proceeds were allocated to the PCS Group and used to repay debt, and to fund capital investments and working capital requirements. 36 In the 2000 second quarter, Sprint issued $1.25 billion of debt securities under its $4 billion shelf registration statement with the SEC. These borrowings mature in 2002 and have interest rates ranging from 6.9% to 7.6%. The proceeds were allocated to the PCS Group and used to repay debt and to fund capital investments and working capital requirements. Sprint believes it has access to other sources of liquidity such as the capital markets and the monetization of non core assets, such as the directory publishing business. Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors Corporate Ratings currently rate Sprints long term senior unsecured debt at Baa1 and BBB+, respectively. A downgrade of either rating may increase the cost of future borrowings. If a downgrade of the long term senior unsecured debt triggered a commercial paper rating downgrade, access to the commercial paper market may become limited. A ratings downgrade to below Baa3 or BBB would result in the acceleration of at least $250 million in debt and potentially as much as $1.1 billion. Management maintains frequent communication with the rating agencies and considers a downgrade below Baa3 or BBB to be unlikely. In January 2002, Moodys Investors Service placed the "Baa1" long term ratings of Sprint and Sprint Capital Corporation under review for possible downgrade. In February 2002, Fitch Ratings downgraded Sprints senior unsecured debt and equity unit security to "BBB" from "BBB+". After the downgrade, the rating outlook for the senior debt of both Sprint and Sprint Capital Corporation changed to Stable from Negative. Sprints ability to fund its capital needs is ultimately impacted by the overall capacity and terms of the commercial paper, bank, term debt and equity markets. There is significant volatility in the markets at this time caused by the economic downturn, recent business failures and reduced confidence in the financial accounting process. Sprint is monitoring the markets closely and is taking steps to maintain as much financial flexibility as possible, while maintaining a reasonable capital structure cost. Sprints contractual obligations, including commitments for future payments under non cancelable lease arrangements and short and long term debt arrangements, are summarized below and are fully disclosed in Notes 10, 11, and 15 to Sprints Consolidated Financial Statements. Sprint does not participate in, nor secure, financings for any unconsolidated, limited purpose entities (SPE).

Financial Strategies General Hedging Policies Sprint selectively enters into interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes on its debt. Sprint also enters into forward contracts and options in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Sprint seeks to minimize counterparty credit risk through stringent credit approval and review processes, the selection of only the most creditworthy counterparties, continual review and monitoring of all counterparties, and thorough legal review of contracts. Sprint also controls exposure to market risk by regularly monitoring changes in foreign exchange and interest rate positions under normal and stress conditions to ensure they do not exceed established limits. Sprints derivative transactions are used for hedging purposes only and comply with Board approved policies. Senior management receives frequent status updates of all outstanding derivative positions. Interest Rate Risk Management Sprints interest rate risk management program focuses on minimizing exposure to interest rate movements, setting an optimal mixture of floating and fixed rate debt, and minimizing liquidity risk. Sprint uses simulation analysis to assess its interest rate 37 exposure and establish the desired ratio of floating and fixed rate debt. To the extent possible, Sprint manages interest rate exposure and the floating to fixed ratio through its borrowings, but sometimes uses interest rate swaps and caps to adjust its risk profile. Sprint does not have significant interest rate swap or cap activity to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in interest rates at December 31, 2001. Foreign Exchange Risk Management Sprints foreign exchange risk management program focuses on hedging transaction exposure to optimize consolidated cash flow. Sprints main transaction exposure results from net payments made to overseas telecommunications companies for completing international calls made by Sprints domestic customers. These international operations were not material to the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows at year end 2001. In addition, foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to Sprints 2001 results of operations. Sprint has not entered into any significant foreign currency forward contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. As a result, Sprint was not subject to material foreign exchange risk. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The risk inherent in Sprints market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors. Sprint is susceptible to certain risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Sprint does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk The communications industry is a capital intensive, technology driven business. Sprint is subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with its borrowings. Sprint selectively enters into interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes on its debt. Approximately 71% of Sprints debt at December 31, 2001 is fixed rate debt. While changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt, there is no impact to earnings and cash flows because Sprint intends to hold these obligations to maturity unless refinancing conditions are favorable. Sprint performs interest rate sensitivity analyses on its variable rate debt. These analyses indicate that a 1% change in interest rates would have a $57 million pre tax impact on the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows at December 31, 2001. While Sprints variable rate debt is subject to earnings and cash flows impacts as interest rates change, it is not subject to changes in fair values. Sprint also prepared a value at risk analysis to assess the worst case impact of past market movements on Sprints 2002 long term debt portfolio. Based on that analysis, which used average interest rates from 1980 to present, Sprint is 95% confident that the fair value of outstanding debt would not increase above Sprints book value over the next six months. Foreign Currency Risk Sprint also enters into forward contracts and options in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Sprint uses foreign currency derivatives to hedge its net foreign currency payable related to settlement of international telecommunications access charges. The dollar equivalent of Sprints net foreign currency payables was $3 million at December 31, 2001. The potential immediate pre tax loss to Sprint that would result from a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates based on these positions would be approximately $635 thousand. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A), Nonoperating Items, Allocation of Group Financing, as well as in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. . Revenue Recognition Policies As discussed in Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Sprint recognizes operating revenues as services are rendered or as products are delivered to customers. In connection with recording revenue, estimates and assumptions are required in determining the expected conversion of the revenue streams to cash collected. The reserve estimation process requires that management make assumptions based on historical results, future expectations, the economic and competitive environment, changes in the credit worthiness of our customers, and other relevant factors. A more detailed discussion of the policies by which Sprint recognizes 23 reserves and adjustments to revenue streams and related reserves and provisions for uncollectible customer accounts is included in our discussion of Segmental Results of Operations within MD&A. . Employee Benefit Plan Assumptions Retirement Benefits are a significant cost of doing business and yet represent obligations that will be settled far in the future. Retirement benefit accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employees approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made by a company. The accounting requires that management make assumptions regarding such variables as the return on assets, the discount rate, and future health care costs. Changes in these key assumptions can have a significant impact on the projected benefit obligations, funding requirements and periodic benefit cost incurred by the company. Sprints policies and key assumptions are included in our discussion of Other Income (Expense), Net within MD&A, as well as in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. . Long lived Asset Recovery Long lived assets, consisting primarily of property, plant and equipment and intangibles, comprise a significant portion of Sprints total assets. Changes in technology or changes in Sprints intended use of these assets may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change. Sprint performs annual internal studies to confirm the appropriateness of estimated economic useful lives for each category of current property, plant and equipment. Additionally, long lived assets, including goodwill and intangibles, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable. Estimates and assumptions used in both setting depreciable lives and testing for recoverability require both judgment and estimation. Sprints policies regarding accounting for these assets and assessing their recoverability are included in our Discussion of Segmental Results of Operations within MD&A, as well as in Notes 1 and 18 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. General Overview of the Sprint FON Group Global Markets Division The global markets division provides a broad suite of communications services targeted to domestic business and residential customers, multinational corporations and other communications companies. These services include domestic and international voice; data communications using various protocols such as Internet protocol (IP) and frame relay (a data service that transfers packets of data over Sprints network), and managed network services. In addition, the global markets division is expanding its ability to provide web and applications hosting, consulting services, and colocation services. Through this division Sprint also provides broadband services and digital subscriber line (DSL) services, which enable high speed transmission of data over existing copper telephone lines. The global markets division also includes the operating results of the cable TV service operations of the broadband fixed wireless companies after their 1999 acquisition dates. During 2000, Sprint converted several markets served by Multipoint Multichannel Distribution Services (MMDS) capabilities from cable TV services to high speed data services. MMDS is a fixed wireless network that can be built either using a system of interconnected smaller cells or as a single tower that distributes signals through microwave from a single transmission point to multiple receiving points. The global markets divisions operating results reflect the development costs and the operating revenues and expenses of these broadband fixed wireless services. In the 2001 fourth quarter Sprint announced it would halt further deployment of MMDS services using current direct sight access technology. Current customers will continue to receive service and Sprint will wait for development of second generation technology. Sprint will also pursue alternative strategies for the spectrum leases and licenses. The global markets division also reflects the costs of establishing international IP operations beginning in 2000. This division also includes the FON Groups investments in EarthLink, Inc., an Internet service provider; Call Net, a long distance provider in Canada; Intelig Telecommunicacoes Ltda. (Intelig), a long distance provider in Brazil; and certain other telecommunications investments and ventures. Local Division The local division (LTD) consists mainly of regulated local phone companies serving approximately 8.2 million access lines in 18 states. LTD provides local voice and data services, including DSL, for customers within its franchise territories, access by phone customers and other carriers to LTDs local network, consumer long distance services to customers within its franchise territories, sales of telecommunications equipment, and other long distance services within certain regional calling areas, or LATAs. 24 Product Distribution and Directory Publishing Businesses The product distribution business provides wholesale distribution services of telecommunications products. The directory publishing business publishes and markets white and yellow page phone directories. General Overview of the Sprint PCS Group The PCS Group includes Sprints wireless PCS operations. It operates a 100% digital PCS wireless network in the United States with licenses to provide service nationwide using a single frequency and a single technology. At year end 2001, the PCS Group, together with third party affiliates, operated PCS systems in over 300 metropolitan markets, including the 50 largest U.S. metropolitan areas. The PCS Group has licenses to serve the entire U.S. population including Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The PCS Groups service, including third party affiliates, now reaches over 247 million people. The PCS Group provides nationwide service through: . operating its own digital network in major U.S. metropolitan areas, . affiliating with other companies, mainly in and around smaller U.S. metropolitan areas, . roaming on other providers analog cellular networks using multi mode handsets, and . roaming on other providers digital networks that use code division multiple access (CDMA). The PCS Group also provides wholesale PCS services to companies that resell the services to their customers on a retail basis. These companies pay the PCS Group a discounted price for their customers usage, but bear the costs of acquisition and customer service. The PCS Group also includes its investment in Pegaso Telecomunicaciones, S.A. de C.V. (Pegaso), a wireless PCS operation in Mexico, SVC BidCo L.P., a joint venture to acquire wireless spectrum rights, and Virgin Mobile U.S.A., a joint venture to market wireless services. These investments are accounted for using the equity method. The wireless industry, including the PCS Group, typically generates a significantly higher number of subscriber additions and handset sales in the fourth quarter of each year compared to the remaining quarters. This is due to the use of retail distribution, which is dependent on the holiday shopping season; the timing of new products and service introductions; and aggressive marketing and sales promotions. Consolidated Results of Operations Total net operating revenues were as follows: 2001 2000 1999 (millions) FON Group $16,924 $17,688 $17,160 PCS Group 9,725 6,341 3,373 Intergroup eliminations (578) (416) (268) Net operating revenues $26,071 $23,613 $20,265 Income (Loss) from continuing operations was as follows: 2001 2000 1999 (millions) FON Group (146) $ 1,292 $ 1,736 PCS Group (1,249) (1,868) (2,481) Intergroup eliminations (7) Loss from continuing operations (1,402) $ (576) $ (745) Income (loss) from continuing operations as presented in the above table includes the after tax impacts of the one time items discussed in the following paragraphs. In the 2001 fourth quarter, Sprint recorded a one time restructuring charge and asset impairment of $1,136 million representing the termination of Sprint ION, as well as additional steps to reduce overall operating costs. Additionally, in the 2001 fourth quarter, Sprint recorded a one time litigation charge of $15 million. The 2001 one time items also include a write down of the FON Groups equity method investment in Intelig of $157 million which had an other than temporary decline in market value, a loss on the sale of a portion of the FON Groups investment in EarthLink of $8 million, a benefit plan curtailment gain of $75 million and net gains from other investment activities of $9 million. Excluding one time items, loss from continuing operations would have been $170 million. In the 2000 fourth quarter, Sprint completed analyses of the valuation of various FON Group assets and equity method investments resulting from its reassessment of the FON Groups business strategies in response to changes in the overall telecommunications industry. These analyses resulted in one time charges of $152 million primarily related to a write down of goodwill associated with the FON Groups Paranet operations, $87 million for the write down of the FON Groups equity method investment in Call Net, which had an other than temporary decline in market value, and $22 million for the write down of certain FON Group investment securities, which had an other than temporary decline in market value. The 2000 one time items also include charges of $121 million for costs associated with the terminated WorldCom merger, net gains of $44 million from the sale of an independent directory publishing 25 operation and investment activities in the FON Group, and an $18 million gain from the sale of customers and network infrastructure to a PCS third party affiliate. Excluding one time items, loss from continuing operations would have been $256 million. In 1999, one time items include a gain of $35 million from investment activities in the FON Group. Excluding the one time item, loss from continuing operations would have been $780 million. Segmental Results of Operations Sprints business is divided into four lines of business: the global markets division, the local division, the product distribution and directory publishing businesses and the PCS wireless telephony products and services business. The FON Group includes the global markets division, the local division and the product distribution and directory publishing businesses. The PCS Group includes the PCS wireless telephony products and services business. The FON common stock is intended to reflect the financial results and economic value of the global markets division, the local division and the product distribution and directory publishing businesses. The PCS common stock is intended to reflect the financial results and economic value of the PCS wireless telephony products and services business. Global Markets Division 2001 2000 1999 (millions) Net operating revenues Voice $ 6,644 $ 7,094 $ 7,445 Data 1,956 1,937 1,696 Internet 1,003 920 615 Other 313 577 552 Total net operating revenues 9,916 10,528 10,308 Operating expenses Costs of services and products 6,004 5,558 4,947 Selling, general and administrative 2,955 3,026 3,141 Depreciation and amortization 1,318 1,121 1,045 Restructuring and asset impairment 1,688 238 Total operating expenses 11,965 9,943 9,133 Operating income (loss) $(2,049) $ 585 $ 1,175 Operating margin NM 5.6% 11.4% Capital expenditures $ 3,580 $ 2,294 $ 1,774 The global markets division faced significant challenges in 2001. The economic downturn coupled with industry wide pricing pressures and excess capacity contributed to a 6% decline in net operating revenues and an operating loss for the year. In the 2001 fourth quarter, a decision was made to abandon the ION initiative and restructure operations resulting in a $1.7 billion charge. These actions were taken to respond to the unprecedented changes in the industry in an effort to better focus on enterprise data and Internet services and aggressively manage costs. Sprint expects continued downward pressure on revenues in 2002 due to the economy and price competition. Some year over year improvement in operating results is expected from the elimination of ION related costs and other cost reduction efforts. Further improvements in operations are largely dependent on the timing and extent of the economic recovery and the degree of growth achieved in the enterprise data and Internet services markets. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues decreased 6% in 2001 and increased 2% in 2000. Minute growth of 20% in 2001 and 18% in 2000, driven in part by the increase in business minutes sold to the PCS Group, was more than offset by a highly competitive pricing environment, as well as the current economic downturn. The decrease in net operating revenues also reflects year over year declines in dial up Internet service provider related revenues, cable capacity sales, professional services and legacy data services. Voice Revenues Voice revenues decreased 6% in 2001 and 5% in 2000. The 2001 decrease includes a decline in business and consumer voice revenues as a result of a more competitive pricing environment and continued wireless substitution. Business voice revenues also declined in 2001 as the revenue mix shifted toward lower yield customers, including affiliate sales and generally lower market pricing. The 2000 decrease was largely due to a decline in consumer voice revenues as a result of a more competitive pricing environment, lower calling card usage due to the increased use of wireless phones, and reductions in access cost pass throughs resulting from the implementation of the Coalition for Affordable Local and Long Distance Service proposal (CALLS). Data Revenues Data revenues reflect sales of current generation data services including asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) and frame relay services. These revenues were flat in 2001 and increased 14% in 2000. Results in 2001 were flat due to increased sales in ATM being offset by a decline in frame relay. Data revenues in 2001 were generally impacted by aggressive pricing in the marketplace and the current economic downturn. The 2000 increase was largely due to increased sales as a result of an increased emphasis on these services. 26 Internet Revenues Internet revenues increased 9% in 2001 and 50% in 2000. The 2001 increase is a result of growth in dedicated IP, web hosting and security. These gains were partially offset by a decline in dial up Internet service provider related revenues driven by pricing declines with Sprints largest customer for these services. The increase in 2000 was due to strong growth in dial up Internet service provider related revenues and dedicated service revenues. Other Revenues Other revenues decreased 46% in 2001 and increased 5% in 2000. The 2001 decrease reflects a lack of cable capacity sales, as well as declines in professional services and legacy data services. The 2000 increase was due to sales of ownership rights to transoceanic cable capacity and the inclusion of a full year of revenues from the cable TV service operations of the broadband fixed wireless companies purchased in 1999 largely offset by a decline in legacy data services. During the 2001, 2000 and 1999 periods, cable capacity sales and sales of ownership rights to transoceanic cable represented less than 0.2%, 1% and 0.03% of net operating revenues, respectively. These transactions were executed primarily with Global One, and were in accordance with our transition services agreement. Equipment sales completed in each of the periods discussed were routine in nature, were completed to support a customers purchase of related telecommunications services, and represented less than 3%, 6% and 4% of net operating revenues for the 2001, 2000 and 1999 periods, respectively. Revenue Reserves All revenues are recognized when the earnings process is complete in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 101 Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements (SAB101). Significant estimates and assumptions are required, however, to determine the expected conversion of these revenues into cash collected. Because of this, the global markets division recognizes several types of reserves and adjustments against revenue. These reserves include: . billing adjustment reserves for pricing changes and usage disputes with customers (principally related to our business and wholesale customer base), . discount reserves for special pricing agreements and volume based incentives, and . fraud reserves for unauthorized usage. Each of these reserves requires managements judgment and are based on historical trending, industry norms, regulatory decisions and recognition of current market indicators regarding general economic conditions. Costs of Services and Products Costs of services and products include interconnection costs paid to local phone companies, other domestic service providers and foreign phone companies to complete calls made by the divisions domestic customers, costs to operate and maintain the long distance network, costs of equipment, and costs related to the development and deployment of Sprint ION. Costs of services and products increased 8% in 2001 and 12% in 2000. Interconnection costs increased 16% in 2001 and remained flat in 2000. The 2001 increase was primarily due to a corresponding increase in call volumes. Reductions in per minute international access costs as well as domestic access costs offset the impact of increased calling volumes in 2000. The domestic rate reductions were generally due to the FCC mandated access rate reductions that took effect in July 1999, July 2000, and July 2001. The access rate reductions in July 2000 included the implementation of CALLS. All other costs of services and products decreased 5% in 2001 and increased 42% in 2000. The 2001 decrease is related to lower sales of ownership rights to capacity on transoceanic cable offset by increased network costs of the long distance operation and costs associated with Sprint ION. The 2000 increase was largely due to the expansion of Sprint ION business services nationwide and the launch of consumer services in select markets as well as increased sales of ownership rights to capacity on transoceanic cable and growth in data services. Total costs of services and products for global markets division were 60.5% of net operating revenues in 2001, 52.8% in 2000 and 48.0% in 1999. Excluding Sprint ION related costs, total costs of services and products for the global markets division were 58.2% of net operating revenues in 2001, 50.5% in 2000 and 47.6% in 1999. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense decreased 2% in 2001 and 4% in 2000. The 2001 decrease is due to a reduction in advertising and promotion costs in both the consumer and business markets and a strong emphasis on cost control, partly offset by increased marketing and promotions of Internet services and an increase in bad debt expense primarily related to wholesale customers. In addition, 27 SG&A in 2001 was impacted by the one time litigation charge of $24 million. The reserve for bad debts requires managements judgment and is based on customer specific indicators, as well as historical trending, industry norms and recognition of current market indicators about general economic conditions. Bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenues was 3.8% in 2001, 2.6% in 2000 and 2.9% in 1999. Reserve for bad debt as a percent of outstanding accounts receivable was 12.7% in 2001, 10.5% in 2000, and 8.3% in 1999. The 2000 decrease in total SG&A expense is due to a strong emphasis on cost control. Total SG&A expense for the global markets division was 29.8% of net operating revenues in 2001, 28.7% in 2000 and 30.5% in 1999. Excluding Sprint ION related costs, SG&A expense for the global markets division was 28.0% of net operating revenues in 2001, 26.7% in 2000 and 28.1% in 1999. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Estimates and assumptions are used both in setting depreciable lives and testing for recoverability. Assumptions are based on internal studies of use, industry data on lives, recognition of technological advancements and understanding of business strategy. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 18% in 2001 and 7% in 2000. The increases mainly reflect an increased asset base to enhance network reliability, meet increased demand for voice and data related services as well as an increased asset base for growth of IP services and other growth initiatives. Depreciation and amortization expense was 13.3% of net operating revenues in 2001, 10.6% in 2000 and 10.1% in 1999. Excluding Sprint ION related costs, depreciation and amortization expense for the global markets division was 12.1% of net operating revenues in 2001, 9.9% in 2000 and 9.5% in 1999. Restructuring and Asset Impairment In the 2001 fourth quarter, Sprint terminated its efforts to provide its Sprint ION consumer and business offerings and announced a restructuring of the remaining global markets division business. This decision resulted in a one time charge of $1.7 billion associated with asset write offs, termination of supplier agreements, real estate leases, and other contractual obligations, as well as work force reduction severance costs. Local Division 2001 2000 1999 (millions) Net operating revenues Local service $2,939 $2,846 $2,677 Network access 2,032 1,987 1,918 Long distance 731 717 611 Other 545 605 752 Total net operating revenues 6,247 6,155 5,958 Operating expenses Costs of services and products 1,955 1,965 2,016 Selling, general and administrative 1,280 1,288 1,320 Depreciation 1,120 1,139 1,069 Restructuring and asset impairment 109 Total operating expenses 4,464 4,392 4,405 Operating income $1,783 $1,763 $1,553 Operating margin 28.5% 28.6% 26.1% Capital expenditures $1,271 $1,371 $1,354 In 2001, the local division was impacted by the economic slow down and growing competition resulting in a decline in access lines and minutes of use. Despite these pressures on revenue growth, the local division achieved steadily improving operating results by effectively managing costs. In the 2001 fourth quarter, the local division realigned its operations to further reduce costs and increase its effectiveness. These actions resulted in a $109 million charge to operations. Sprint expects that the economy and competition will continue to adversely impact access lines and minutes of use in 2002. However, revenues are expected to improve slightly and operating income is expected to be at a level consistent with 2001. Again, results are dependent on the timing and extent of the economic recovery. Beginning in July 2000, Sprint changed its transfer pricing for certain transactions between FON Group entities to more accurately reflect market pricing. The main effect of this change was a reduction in the local divisions Net Operating Revenues Other Revenues. In addition, Sprints local division transferred a customer service and telemarketing organization to the PCS Group at the beginning of the 2000 second quarter. For comparative purposes, the following discussion of local division results assumes the transfer pricing change and the transfer of the customer service and telemarketing organization occurred at the beginning of 1999. Adjusting for these changes, operating margins would have been 28.5% in 2001, 28.4% in 2000 and 25.7% in 1999. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues increased 2% in 2001 and 5% in 2000. These increases mainly reflect increased special access revenue and increased sales of 28 network based services such as Caller ID and Call Waiting. Sales of network based services and long distance services increased due to strong demand for bundled services which combine local service, network based features and long distance calling. The local division ended 2001 with 8.2 million switched access lines, a decrease of 1% in 2001. Access lines increased 4% in 2000. The decrease in 2001 is driven by the economic slowdown, wireless and cable substitution and losses to competitive local providers. Net operating revenues were $6.2 billion in 2001, $6.1 billion in 2000 and $5.8 billion in 1999. Local Service Revenues Local service revenues, derived from local exchange services, grew 3% in 2001 and 6% in 2000 due to continued demand for network based services as well as increased equipment maintenance revenue. Revenue growth in 2000 also reflects increased revenues from access line growth. Network Access Revenues Network access revenues, derived from long distance phone companies using the local network to complete calls, increased 2% in 2001 and 4% in 2000. These increases mainly reflect strong growth in special access services. Volume growth in both periods was offset by FCC mandated access rate reductions. Revenue growth in 2000 also reflects a 2% increase in minutes of use, however, revenue growth in 2001 is offset by a 3% reduction in minutes of use. Long Distance Revenues Long distance revenues are mainly derived from providing consumer long distance services to customers within Sprints local franchise territories and other long distance services within specified regional calling areas, or LATAs, that are beyond the local calling area. These revenues increased 2% in 2001 and 17% in 2000. These increases reflect the success of bundled services, however, the 2001 growth is offset by a decline in intra LATA long distance services. Other Revenues Other revenues decreased 2% in 2001 and 11% in 2000. These decreases were driven by a decline in equipment sales of 9% in 2001 and 20% in 2000 offset by an increase in colocation and data base revenues. The decreases in equipment sales were a result of both a planned shift in focus to selling higher margin products and the economic slowdown causing a reduction in customer demand for equipment. Revenue Reserves All revenues are recognized when the earnings process is complete in accordance with SAB101. Significant estimates and assumptions are required, however, to determine the expected conversion of these revenues into cash collected. Because of this, the local division recognizes several types of reserves and adjustments against revenues. These reserves include: . billing adjustment reserves for pricing changes, volume discounts and usage disputes with customers (principally related to our business and wholesale customer base), . fraud reserves for unauthorized usage and . return and rebate reserves for equipment sales. Each of these reserves requires managements judgment and is based on historical trending, industry norms, regulatory decisions and recognition of current market indicators about general economic conditions. Costs of Services and Products Costs of services and products include costs to operate and maintain the local network and costs of equipment sales. These costs were flat in 2001 and decreased 1% in 2000. In 2001, declines in equipment sales and the success of cost control initiatives were offset by increases in access expense. The 2000 decrease was due to a decline in equipment sales. Costs of services and products were 31.3% of net operating revenues in 2001, 31.9% in 2000 and 33.8% in 1999. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Despite increases in bad debt expense, SG&A expense remained flat in 2001 and declined 1% in 2000 due to a strong emphasis on cost control. In 2001, a continuing emphasis on cost control, partly offset by an increase in bad debt expense accounted for these expenses being flat. The reserve for bad debts requires managements judgment and is based on historical trending, industry norms and recognition of current market indicators about general economic conditions. Bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenues was 2.5% in 2001, 1.5% in 2000, and 1.1% in 1999. Reserve for bad debt expense as a percent of outstanding accounts receivable was 6.9% in 2001, 4.8% in 2000, and 6.4% in 1999. SG&A expense was 20.4% of net operating revenues in 2001, 21.0% in 2000 and 22.3% in 1999. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Estimates and assumptions are used both in setting depreciable lives and testing for recoverability. Assumptions are based on internal studies of use, industry data on lives, recognition of technological 29 advancements and understanding of business strategy. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased 2% in 2001 and increased 7% in 2000. The 2001 decrease is primarily due to a decrease in metallic cable depreciation rates. The decrease is due to metallic cable proving to be adequate in carrying higher bandwidth services such as DSL, thus extending its life. The 2000 increase was mainly due to increased capital expenditures in switching and transport technologies which have shorter asset lives. Depreciation and amortization expense was 18.0% of net operating revenues in 2001, 18.5% in 2000 and 18.2% in 1999. Restructuring and Asset Impairment In the fourth quarter of 2001, Sprint announced plans to take steps to improve its competitive position and reduce operating costs in the business units that comprise its FON Group. These efforts included consolidation and streamlining of marketing and network operations, as well as streamlining of corporate support functions. This decision resulted in a one time charge of $109 million associated with the severance costs of the work force reductions and contractual obligations. Product Distribution and Directory Publishing Businesses 2001 2000 1999 (millions) Net operating revenues $1,762 $1,936 $1,758 Operating expenses Costs of services and products 1,276 1,460 1,345 Selling, general and administrative 174 176 154 Depreciation and amortization 21 16 17 Restructuring charge 7 Total operating expenses 1,478 1,652 1,516 Operating income $ 284 $ 284 $ 242 Operating margin 16.1% 14.7% 13.8% Capital expenditures $ 111 $ 8 $ 36 In 2001, the product distribution business was impacted by the economic slow down. The cut back in capital spending in the telecommunications industry caused a significant reduction in non affiliated sales. Sprint expects the demand for equipment to continue to be soft in 2002. Net Operating Revenues Net operating revenues decreased 9% in 2001 and increased 10% in 2000. Nonaffiliated revenues accounted for over 60% of revenues in 2001, 2000 and 1999. These revenues decreased 14% in 2001 and increased 11% in 2000. The decrease in 2001 nonaffiliated revenues was mainly due to significant decreases in equipment sales resulting from the economic slowdown causing reduced customer demand for equipment. The increase in nonaffiliated revenues in 2000 was mainly due to the consolidation of a directory publishing partnership. In the second half of 2000, the directory publishing partnership, previously accounted for as an equity method investment, was fully consolidated due to a restructuring in the partnership management. Sales to affiliates were flat in 2001, but increased 8% in 2000 due to changes in the local divisions capital program. Operating Expenses Costs of services and products decreased 13% in 2001 and increased 9% in 2000. The 2001 decrease reflects a decrease in equipment sales. The 2000 increase was due to the consolidation of the directory publishing partnership. SG&A expense decreased 1% in 2001 and increased 14% in 2000. The 2000 increase was due to costs related to the transformation of the product distribution business to a web enabled business as well as the consolidation of the directory publishing partnership. In the fourth quarter of 2001, Sprint announced plans to take steps to improve its competitive position and reduce operating costs in the business units that comprise its FON Group. These efforts included consolidation and streamlining of marketing and network operations, as well as streamlining of corporate support functions. This decision resulted in a charge of $7 million associated with the severance costs of the work force reductions and contractual obligations. PCS Group 2001 2000 1999 (millions) Net operating revenues $ 9,725 $ 6,341 $ 3,373 Operating expenses Costs of services and products 5,295 3,942 3,150 Selling, general and administrative 2,917 2,426 1,937 Depreciation and amortization 2,150 1,877 1,523 Restructuring and asset impairment 10 Merger related costs 24 Total operating expenses 10,372 8,269 6,610 Operating loss $ (647) $(1,928) $(3,237) Loss from continuing operations $(1,249) $(1,868) $(2,481) Capital expenditures $ 3,751 $ 3,047 $ 2,580 In 2001, the PCS Group led the industry in customer growth for the third year in a row resulting in a 53% increase in net operating revenues and a $1.28 billion 30 improvement in operating results. For much of 2001, the impact of the economic downturn had not extended to the wireless industry. However, in the fourth quarter, there were signs of weakening in customer growth for both the wireless industry and the PCS Group. Based on an industry consensus view that about 17 million new wireless subscribers will be added in 2002, Sprint would expect to add about 3 million net customers in 2002 while continuing to focus on profitability. The PCS Group markets its products through multiple distribution channels, including its own retail stores as well as other retail outlets. Equipment sales to one retail chain and the subsequent service revenues generated by sales to its customers accounted for 24% of net operating revenues in 2001 and 2000, and 27% in 1999. Net Operating Revenues 2001 2000 1999 Customers at year end (millions) 13.6 9.5 5.7 Average monthly service revenue per user (ARPU) $ 61 $ 59 $ 58 Net operating revenues include service revenues and sales of handsets and accessory equipment. Service revenues consist of monthly recurring charges, usage charges and activation fees. Service revenues increased 58% in 2001 mainly reflecting an increase in the average number of customers and an increase in ARPU. The improvement in ARPU in 2001 was mainly due to customers subscribing to higher usage service plans, an increase in billed minutes over plan and the implementation of activation charges in the second quarter of 2000. The PCS Group assesses access charges to long distance carriers for the termination of landline originated calls. Though regulations generally entitle a carrier that terminates a call on the behalf of another to be compensated for providing that service, these regulations were developed in a period where services of this nature were provided exclusively by local exchange carriers. Certain long distance carriers have disputed the PCS Groups assessment of these charges as well as the corresponding rate at which the charges were determined. The issue is currently pending before the FCC. Management cannot predict, with certainty, the final outcome of this action, but believes adequate provisions have been recorded in the PCS Groups results of operations. The PCS Group added 4.0 million customers in 2001 to end the year with over 13.6 million customers in more than 300 metropolitan markets nationwide. Service revenues from resale customers declined in 2001 mainly due to the discontinuation of one reseller program, which reduced the reseller customer base by 91,000 to 219,000 in 2001 from 310,000 in 2000. The PCS Group third party affiliates added more than 1.2 million customers in 2001, bringing the total number of customers served on the PCS network, including resale customers, to more than 15.8 million. Service revenues increased 94% in 2000 mainly reflecting an increase in the average number of customers. The PCS Group added 3.8 million customers in 2000 to end the year with over 9.5 million customers in more than 300 metropolitan markets nationwide. The increase in ARPU in 2000 was partly due to the implementation of activation charges in the second quarter. Subscriber revenues were also aided by the increase in resale customers. The companies that the PCS Group serves on a wholesale basis added 238,000 customers in 2000, ending the year with approximately 310,000 customers. In 2001, the customer churn rate improved to 2.6% from 2.8% in 2000 and 3.4% in 1999. The churn rate improved from 1999 through the first half of 2001, reaching as low as 2.2% in the quarter ended June 30, 2001. This improvement reflected expanded network coverage, increased percentage of customers under contract and the success of several customer retention initiatives. The increase in the churn rate for the last half of 2001 resulted from customer fulfillment of contract terms, the softness of the economy, and the impact of a new program targeting sub prime customers. The PCS Group expects customer churn rate to continue to increase during the beginning of 2002, but decline to an annual average of approximately 3%. Revenues from sales of handsets and accessories were approximately 12% of net operating revenues in 2001, 14% in 2000 and 17% in 1999. As part of the PCS Groups marketing plans, handsets are normally sold at prices below the PCS Groups cost. Revenue Reserves All revenues are recognized when the earnings process is complete in accordance with SAB101. Significant estimates and assumptions are required, however, to determine the expected conversion of these revenues into cash collected. Because of this, the PCS Group recognizes several types of reserves and adjustments against revenue. These reserves include: . billing adjustment reserves for disputes with customers, . fraud reserves for unauthorized usage, . access reserves for disputed charges with local exchange carriers and inter exchange carriers, and . return and rebate reserves for equipment sales. 31 Each of these reserves requires managements judgment and are based on historical trending, industry norms, regulatory decisions and recognition of current market indicators about general economic conditions. Operating Expenses Costs of services and products mainly include handset and accessory costs, switch and cell site expenses and other network related costs. These costs increased 34% in 2001 and 25% in 2000 reflecting the significant growth in customers and expanded market coverage, partly offset by a reduction in handset unit costs. SG&A expense mainly includes customer care and marketing costs to promote products and services as well as salary and benefit costs. SG&A expense increased 20% in 2001 and 25% in 2000 reflecting an expanded workforce to support subscriber growth and increased marketing and selling costs. 2001 2000 1999 (millions) Acquisition costs per gross customer addition (CPGA) $340 $370 $450 Monthly cash costs per user (CCPU) $ 33 $ 35 $ 48 CPGA is a measure of the sales and marketing efforts computed as the costs of acquiring a new subscriber, including equipment subsidies and marketing costs divided by handset activations. CPGA improved approximately 7% in 2001 and 19% in 2000. Lower handset unit costs and scale benefits from greater customer additions have contributed to the improvement. CCPU is a measure of the cash costs to operate the business on a per user basis consisting of costs of service revenues, service delivery and other general and administrative costs divided by average subscribers. CCPU improved approximately 6% in 2001 and 27% in 2000. The improvements realized in 2001 were driven by lower network, information technology, and administrative costs partially offset by higher cost of service. The improvements in 2000 reflect successful expense management and scale benefits resulting from the increased customer base. Economic conditions in 2001 required greater scrutiny of bad debt expense. The reserve for bad debts requires judgment and is based on historical trending, industry norms and recognition of current market indicators. Bad debt expense as a percentage of net revenues was constant at 3.9% in 2000 and 2001, and was 5.7% in 1999. Reserve for bad debt as a percent of outstanding accounts receivable was 13.0% in 2001, 11.1% in 2000, and 8.5% in 1999. Estimates and assumptions are used both in setting depreciable lives and testing for recoverability. Assumptions are based on internal studies of use, industry data on lives, recognition of technological advancements and understanding of business strategy. Depreciation and amortization expense consists mainly of depreciation of network assets and amortization of intangible assets. The intangible assets include goodwill, PCS licenses, customer base, microwave relocation costs and assembled workforce. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 15% in 2001 and 23% in 2000 mainly reflecting depreciation of the network assets placed in service during 2001 and 2000. Additionally, the PCS Group increased depreciation of certain network assets in the 2001 first quarter to reflect the accelerated replacement of the assets to accommodate network technology upgrades. In May 2001, a significant portion of the value assigned to acquired customer base became fully amortized which caused a $168 million decrease in 2001 compared to the same 2000 period. The 2000 increase also reflects amortization of intangible assets acquired in the Cox PCS purchase in the 1999 second quarter. In the fourth quarter of 2001, Sprint announced plans to take steps to improve its competitive position and reduce operating costs in the business units that comprise its FON Group. These efforts included consolidation and streamlining of marketing and network operations, as well as streamlining of corporate support functions. The decision to streamline corporate functions resulted in a one time charge of $10 million to PCS Group associated with the severance costs of the work force reductions and contractual obligations. In 2000, operating expenses include a one time charge of $24 million for costs associated with the terminated WorldCom merger. This charge increased the loss from continuing operations by $16 million. In 2000, loss from continuing operations includes a one time gain of $18 million from the sale of customers and network infrastructure to a PCS Group third party affiliate. Employee Benefit Plan Assumptions Significant estimates and assumptions are required in determining the liabilities and costs associated with Sprints pension and other post retirement benefit plans and the results can vary significantly with changes in key assumptions. Sprint works closely with its independent actuary to determine the appropriateness of the various assumptions. Sprint has consistently used benchmark rates tied to high quality investment funds with lives closely matching the pension liability in assessing its assumptions for 32 the applicable discount rate. The expected rate of return on plan assets is based on the mix of assets held by the plan and their historical long term rates of return. Reasonable anticipation of future medical care cost trends are also provided by Sprints independent actuary. A more detailed discussion of Sprints policies and status of its plans is included in Note 8 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Nonoperating Items Interest Expense The effective interest rates in the following table reflect interest expense on long term debt only. Interest costs on short term borrowings classified as long term debt, deferred compensation plans and customer deposits have been excluded so as not to distort the effective interest rates on long term debt. 2001 2000 1999 Effective interest rate on long term debt 6.7% 6.9% 7.0% Sprints effective interest rate on long term debt decreased in 2000 and 2001 due to additional fixed rate debt with lower interest rates and lower interest rates on variable rate debt. Allocation of Group Financing Financing activities for the groups are managed by Sprint on a centralized basis. Debt incurred by Sprint on behalf of the groups is specifically allocated to and reflected in the financial statements of the applicable group. Interest expense is allocated to the PCS Group based on an interest rate that is substantially equal to the rate it would be able to obtain from third parties as a direct or indirect wholly owned Sprint subsidiary, but without the benefit of any guarantee by Sprint or any member of the FON Group. That interest rate is higher than the rate Sprint obtains on borrowings. The difference between Sprints actual interest rate and the rate charged to the PCS Group is reflected as a reduction in the FON Groups interest expense and totaled $288 million in 2001, $237 million in 2000 and $168 million in 1999. These amounts are reflected in the "Intergroup interest charge" on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The FON Group earned intergroup interest income and the PCS Group incurred intergroup interest expense of $15 million in 2001, $19 million in 2000 and $20 million in 1999 primarily related to the FON Groups ownership of PCS Group debt securities. Sprint redeemed these securities in the 2001 fourth quarter. As a result of this redemption, the FON Group recognized an $11 million pre tax gain to other non operating income and the PCS Group recorded a $7 million after tax extraordinary loss related to an early redemption premium payment made by the PCS Group to the FON Group. Under Sprints centralized cash management program, one group may advance funds to the other group. These advances are accounted for as short term borrowings between the groups and bear interest at a market rate that is substantially equal to the rate that group would be able to obtain from third parties on a short term basis. The allocation of group financing activities may change at the discretion of the Sprint board and does not require shareholder approval. Other Income (Expense), Net Other income (expense) consisted of the following: 2001 2000 1999 (millions) Dividend and interest income $ 33 $ 30 $ 23 Equity in net losses of affiliates (157) (238) (72) Net losses from investments (188) (102) (15) Gains on sales of other assets 10 92 102 Benefit plan curtailment gain 120 Other, net (1) 1 37 Total $(183) $(217) $ 75 Dividend and interest income for all years reflects dividends earned on cost method investments and interest earned on temporary investments. In 2001, investments accounted for using the equity method mainly consisted of the FON Groups investment in Intelig, a long distance operation in Brazil, and the PCS Groups investment in Pegaso, a wireless PCS operation in Mexico. Pegaso is currently experiencing financial difficulties and is evaluating various restructuring alternatives. In 1999 and 2000, investments accounted for using the equity method also included the FON Groups investments in EarthLink, Inc., an Internet service provider, and Call Net, a long distance provider in Canada. In the first quarter of 2001, Sprint modified its relationship with EarthLink which resulted in its investment in common stock no longer being accounted for using the equity method. In the fourth quarter of 2000, Sprint wrote down its investment in Call Net and is no longer required to recognize any related equity in losses. The 2001 equity in net losses of affiliates decreased due to fewer equity losses following the write down of the investments in Call Net and Intelig. These decreases were partially offset by increased Pegaso losses. The 2000 increase is mainly due to increased Intelig losses and losses from Pegaso after the PCS Groups 2000 second quarter initial investment. Net losses from investments in 2001 mainly include a $162 million write down of an equity investment in 33 Intelig and a $25 million loss on the partial sale of EarthLink shares. The 2000 loss includes an $87 million write down of an equity investment in Call Net, and a $35 million write down of warrants held in Purchase Pro.com. The 1999 loss includes a $102 million write down of an investment in Iridium partially offset by a $90 million gain on sale of AOL Time Warner stock. Gains on sales of other assets in 2001 resulted from the sale of PCS customers to a PCS third party affiliate. The 2000 gains include the sale of an independent publishing operation and the sale of certain wireless customers and associated network infrastructure. The 1999 gains include a gain on the sale of an investment security and a gain on the sale of network infrastructure. The benefit plan curtailment gain in 2001 resulted from an amendment of certain medical retirement plan benefits. Income Taxes Sprints consolidated effective tax rates were 30.8% in 2001, 17.9% in 2000 and 30.5% in 1999. See Note 9 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information about the differences that caused the effective income tax rates to vary from the statutory federal rate for income taxes related to continuing operations. Discontinued Operation, Net In the 2000 first quarter, Sprint sold its interest in Global One to France Telecom and Deutsche Telekom AG. Sprint received $1.1 billion in cash and was repaid $276 million for advances for its entire stake in Global One. As a result of Sprints sale of its interest in Global One, Sprints gain on sale and its equity share of the results of Global One have been reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented. In 2000, Sprint recorded an after tax gain related to the sale of its interest in Global One of $675 million. Sprint recorded after tax losses related to Global One of $130 million in 1999. Extraordinary Items, Net In 2001, Sprint redeemed, before scheduled maturities, $18 million of debt allocated to the FON Group and $558 million of debt allocated to the PCS Group. These borrowings had interest rates ranging from 9.9% to 12.5%. This resulted in a $1 million after tax extraordinary loss for Sprint. In 2000, Sprint redeemed, before scheduled maturities, $25 million of debt allocated to the FON Group and $127 million of debt allocated to the PCS Group. These borrowings had interest rates ranging from 7.8% to 9.7%. This resulted in a $4 million after tax extraordinary loss for Sprint. In 1999, Sprint redeemed, before scheduled maturities, $575 million of the broadband fixed wireless companies debt assumed by the FON Group and $2.2 billion of revolving credit facilities and other borrowings allocated to the PCS Group. These borrowings had interest rates ranging from 5.6% to 14.5%. This resulted in a $60 million after tax extraordinary loss for Sprint. Financial Condition 2001 2000 (millions) FON Group $24,164 $24,089 PCS Group 22,190 19,763 Intergroup eliminations (561) (784) Consolidated assets $45,793 $43,068 Sprints consolidated assets increased $2.7 billion in 2001. Net property, plant and equipment increased $3.7 billion reflecting capital expenditures to support the PCS network expansion and fill in, the build out of the IP network, and long distance and local network enhancements, partly offset by depreciation and network asset sales. Investments in affiliates decreased $319 million, mainly reflecting equity in net losses of those affiliates and the write down of certain equity method investments. The rating agencies generally give some form of equity treatment for equity unit notes in determining debt to total capital ratios. The Sprint debt to total capital ratio was 59.9% at year end 2001 versus 57.3% at year end 2000, assuming that the Sprint equity unit notes are treated as 80% equity and 20% debt. Accordingly, the debt to total capital ratio for Sprint is calculated defining "debt" as short term borrowings, long term debt, capital lease obligations and 20% of the equity unit notes value. Total capital is defined as "debt", plus the remaining 80% of the equity unit notes value, redeemable preferred stock and total shareholders equity. See "Liquidity and Capital Resources" for more information about changes in Sprints Consolidated Balance Sheets. Liquidity and Capital Resources Sprints Board exercises discretion regarding the liquidity and capital resource needs of each group. This includes the ability to prioritize the use of capital and debt capacity, to determine cash management policies and to make decisions regarding the timing and amount of capital expenditures. The actions of the Board of Directors are subject to its fiduciary duties to all shareholders of Sprint and not just to the holders of a particular class of common stock. Given the Boards discretion in these matters, it may be difficult to assess each groups liquidity and capital resource needs and future prospects based on past performance. 34 Operating Activities 2001 2000 1999 (millions) FON Group $4,585 $4,305 $ 3,700 PCS Group 106 (8) (1,692) Intergroup eliminations (69) Cash flows provided by operating activities $4,691 $4,297 $ 1,939 Operating cash flows increased $394 million in 2001 and $2.4 billion in 2000. The 2001 increase reflects improved operating results in the PCS Group partly offset by a decline in FON Group operating results. The 2001 increase also reflects decreases in working capital requirements in the FON Group partly offset by increases in working capital requirements in the PCS Group. The decrease in FON Group working capital requirements was caused primarily by the reduction in accounts receivable which resulted from the global markets division revenue decline and increased billing adjustments, bad debt and cash collections. Also causing the decrease was accrued restructuring costs not paid at year end 2001. The increase in PCS Group working capital requirements was caused primarily by the increase in accounts receivable, which resulted mainly from larger revenues associated with subscriber growth. The 2000 increase in operating cash flows reflects decreases in working capital requirements in both the FON Group and the PCS Group and improved operating results of the PCS Group. The 2000 decrease in working capital requirements was caused primarily by increases in accounts payable and other current liabilities associated with purchases of equipment to support subscriber growth and the adoption of SAB101. These increases more than offset increases in accounts receivable and inventories associated with subscriber growth. Investing Activities 2001 2000 1999 (millions) FON Group $(5,036) $(3,335) $(4,336) PCS Group (3,742) (3,054) (2,509) Intergroup eliminations (299) Cash flows used by investing activities $(8,778) $(6,389) $(7,144) The FON Groups capital expenditures totaled $5.3 billion in 2001, $4.1 billion in 2000 and $3.5 billion in 1999. Global markets division capital expenditures were incurred mainly to enhance network reliability, meet increased demand for voice and data related services, upgrade capabilities for providing new products and services and to continue development and hardware deployment of Sprint ION before the termination of this initiative. The local division incurred capital expenditures to accommodate voice grade equivalent growth, expand capabilities for providing enhanced services and continue the build out of high speed DSL services. Other FON Group capital expenditures were incurred mainly for Sprints World Headquarters Campus. PCS Group capital expenditures, totaling $3.8 billion in 2001, $3.0 billion in 2000 and $2.6 billion in 1999, were incurred to support the continued PCS network expansion and fill in. The 2001 amount also includes approximately $600 million of expenditures related to deployment of 3G technology which is expected to be operational in the middle of 2002. Investing activities also include proceeds from sales of other assets totaling $301 million in 2001, $258 million in 2000 and $243 million in 1999. In 2000, investing activities also include $1.4 billion of proceeds from the sale of the FON Groups interest in Global One. In 1999, Sprint purchased several broadband fixed wireless companies for $618 million excluding assumed debt. "Investments in and loans to affiliates, net" were $66 million in 2001, $889 million in 2000 and $135 million in 1999. These amounts were mainly for investments in EarthLink, Intelig and Pegaso. See Note 3 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on investments. Financing Activities 2001 2000 1999 (millions) FON Group $ 463 $ (952) $ 308 PCS Group 3,698 3,163 4,044 Intergroup eliminations 368 Cash flows provided by financing activities $4,161 $2,211 $4,720 Financing activities reflect net borrowings of $4.0 billion in 2001, $2.3 billion in 2000 and $4.0 billion in 1999. Financing activities also reflect net proceeds from the issuance of common stock of $608 million in 2001, $269 million in 2000 and $957 million in 1999. Proceeds from these borrowings and common stock issuances were used mainly to fund capital investments and working capital requirements. Sprint paid dividends of $451 million in 2001, $448 million in 2000 and $441 million in 1999. Also included in financing activities are proceeds from Sprints employee stock purchase plan of $108 million in 2001, $182 million in 2000 and $136 million in 1999. Capital Requirements Sprints 2002 investing activities, mainly consisting of capital expenditures and investments in affiliates, are expected to total $6.4 billion. This excludes any funding for NextWave spectrum, as the company 35 believes this auction will be either significantly delayed or terminated. FON Group capital expenditures are expected to be $3.0 billion. PCS Group capital expenditures are expected to be $3.4 billion. Sprint continues to review capital expenditure requirements closely and will adjust spending and capital investment in concert with growth. Investments in affiliates are expected to be less than $50 million. Dividend payments are expected to approximate $459 million in 2002. After considering cash generated from operations, our incremental cash needs in 2002 are expected to be $1.0 billion. In connection with the PCS Restructuring, Sprint adopted a tax sharing agreement providing for the allocation of income taxes between the FON Group and the PCS Group. That agreement expired with the 2001 tax year, and Sprint has adopted a continuation of that tax sharing arrangement except for the elimination of provisions addressing certain types of acquisitions or restructurings, which never became operable under the original arrangement. Sprint expects the FON Group to continue to make significant payments to the PCS Group under this arrangement because of expected PCS Group operating losses in the near future and from using the PCS Groups net operating loss carryforwards. These payments reflect the PCS Groups incremental cumulative effect on Sprints consolidated federal and state tax liability and tax credit position. The PCS Group received payments from the FON Group totaling $292 million in 2001, $872 million in 2000, and $764 million in 1999. See Note 1 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, Allocation of Federal and State Income Taxes, for more details. Liquidity Sprint currently uses commercial paper to fund most of its short term working capital needs. Sprint also uses the long term bond market as well as other debt markets to fund its needs. Sprint intends to continue borrowing funds through the U.S. and international money and capital markets and bank credit markets to fund capital expenditures and operating and working capital requirements. Sprint currently has revolving credit facilities with syndicates of domestic and international banks totaling $5 billion; $3 billion of which is a 364 day facility, expiring in August 2002, and $2 billion of which is a five year facility expiring in August 2003. These facilities are unused, however, Sprints commercial paper borrowings are supported by these revolving credit facilities. Certain other notes payable relate to a separate revolving credit facility of $500 million which expires in December 2002. At year end 2001, Sprint had total unused lines of credit of $1.9 billion assuming Sprints commercial paper borrowings as outstanding on these credit facilities. In addition, Sprint had standby letters of credit serving as a backup to various obligations totaling $133 million at year end 2001. Any borrowings Sprint may incur are ultimately limited by certain debt covenants. Sprint could borrow up to an additional $4 billion at year end 2001 under the most restrictive of its debt covenants. Sprint is currently in compliance with all debt covenants associated with its borrowings. In March 2002, Sprint signed a commitment letter for a $1 billion term loan facility. This commitment, which is fully incremental to the $5 billion revolving credit facilities, is for a nine month loan secured by the assets of Sprints directory publishing business. This term loan facility is expected to fully fund Sprints 2002 incremental cash needs. In the 2001 fourth quarter, Sprint issued $1.75 billion of debt securities through a private debt placement. These borrowings have an interest rate of 6.0% and mature in 2007. The proceeds were allocated to both the FON and PCS Groups and used to repay debt and to fund capital investments and working capital requirements. As a condition to the sale of these securities, Sprint agreed to conduct an exchange offer that allowed the original securities to be exchanged for substantially identical securities that are registered with the SEC. The exchange offer terminated on February 21, 2002. In the 2001 third quarter, Sprint completed a registered offering of 23.5 million shares of its Series 1 PCS common stock. Net proceeds from the issuance were approximately $561 million after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses. The proceeds were used to repay debt, and to fund capital investments and working capital requirements. In the 2001 third quarter, Sprint completed a registered offering of 69 million equity units, each with a stated amount of $25. Net proceeds from the issuance were approximately $1.7 billion after deducting the underwriting discount and other offering expenses. The proceeds were allocated to the PCS Group and used to repay debt, and to fund capital investments and working capital requirements. See Note 11 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, "Equity Unit Offering" for a more detailed description of the equity units. In the 2001 first quarter, Sprint issued $2.4 billion of debt securities. Sprint had $2 billion of unissued securities under its existing shelf registration statement with the SEC, and registered an additional $400 million before the issuance. These borrowings have interest rates ranging from 7.1% to 7.6% and mature in 2006 and 2011. The proceeds were allocated to the PCS Group and used to repay debt, and to fund capital investments and working capital requirements. 36 In the 2000 second quarter, Sprint issued $1.25 billion of debt securities under its $4 billion shelf registration statement with the SEC. These borrowings mature in 2002 and have interest rates ranging from 6.9% to 7.6%. The proceeds were allocated to the PCS Group and used to repay debt and to fund capital investments and working capital requirements. Sprint believes it has access to other sources of liquidity such as the capital markets and the monetization of non core assets, such as the directory publishing business. Moodys Investors Service and Standard & Poors Corporate Ratings currently rate Sprints long term senior unsecured debt at Baa1 and BBB+, respectively. A downgrade of either rating may increase the cost of future borrowings. If a downgrade of the long term senior unsecured debt triggered a commercial paper rating downgrade, access to the commercial paper market may become limited. A ratings downgrade to below Baa3 or BBB would result in the acceleration of at least $250 million in debt and potentially as much as $1.1 billion. Management maintains frequent communication with the rating agencies and considers a downgrade below Baa3 or BBB to be unlikely. In January 2002, Moodys Investors Service placed the "Baa1" long term ratings of Sprint and Sprint Capital Corporation under review for possible downgrade. In February 2002, Fitch Ratings downgraded Sprints senior unsecured debt and equity unit security to "BBB" from "BBB+". After the downgrade, the rating outlook for the senior debt of both Sprint and Sprint Capital Corporation changed to Stable from Negative. Sprints ability to fund its capital needs is ultimately impacted by the overall capacity and terms of the commercial paper, bank, term debt and equity markets. There is significant volatility in the markets at this time caused by the economic downturn, recent business failures and reduced confidence in the financial accounting process. Sprint is monitoring the markets closely and is taking steps to maintain as much financial flexibility as possible, while maintaining a reasonable capital structure cost. Sprints contractual obligations, including commitments for future payments under non cancelable lease arrangements and short and long term debt arrangements, are summarized below and are fully disclosed in Notes 10, 11, and 15 to Sprints Consolidated Financial Statements. Sprint does not participate in, nor secure, financings for any unconsolidated, limited purpose entities (SPE).

Financial Strategies General Hedging Policies Sprint selectively enters into interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes on its debt. Sprint also enters into forward contracts and options in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Sprint seeks to minimize counterparty credit risk through stringent credit approval and review processes, the selection of only the most creditworthy counterparties, continual review and monitoring of all counterparties, and thorough legal review of contracts. Sprint also controls exposure to market risk by regularly monitoring changes in foreign exchange and interest rate positions under normal and stress conditions to ensure they do not exceed established limits. Sprints derivative transactions are used for hedging purposes only and comply with Board approved policies. Senior management receives frequent status updates of all outstanding derivative positions. Interest Rate Risk Management Sprints interest rate risk management program focuses on minimizing exposure to interest rate movements, setting an optimal mixture of floating and fixed rate debt, and minimizing liquidity risk. Sprint uses simulation analysis to assess its interest rate 37 exposure and establish the desired ratio of floating and fixed rate debt. To the extent possible, Sprint manages interest rate exposure and the floating to fixed ratio through its borrowings, but sometimes uses interest rate swaps and caps to adjust its risk profile. Sprint does not have significant interest rate swap or cap activity to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in interest rates at December 31, 2001. Foreign Exchange Risk Management Sprints foreign exchange risk management program focuses on hedging transaction exposure to optimize consolidated cash flow. Sprints main transaction exposure results from net payments made to overseas telecommunications companies for completing international calls made by Sprints domestic customers. These international operations were not material to the consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows at year end 2001. In addition, foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to Sprints 2001 results of operations. Sprint has not entered into any significant foreign currency forward contracts or other derivative instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. As a result, Sprint was not subject to material foreign exchange risk. Recently Issued Accounting Pronouncements See Note 18 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk The risk inherent in Sprints market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors. Sprint is susceptible to certain risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Sprint does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. Interest Rate Risk The communications industry is a capital intensive, technology driven business. Sprint is subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with its borrowings. Sprint selectively enters into interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage its exposure to interest rate changes on its debt. Approximately 71% of Sprints debt at December 31, 2001 is fixed rate debt. While changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt, there is no impact to earnings and cash flows because Sprint intends to hold these obligations to maturity unless refinancing conditions are favorable. Sprint performs interest rate sensitivity analyses on its variable rate debt. These analyses indicate that a 1% change in interest rates would have a $57 million pre tax impact on the consolidated statements of operations and cash flows at December 31, 2001. While Sprints variable rate debt is subject to earnings and cash flows impacts as interest rates change, it is not subject to changes in fair values. Sprint also prepared a value at risk analysis to assess the worst case impact of past market movements on Sprints 2002 long term debt portfolio. Based on that analysis, which used average interest rates from 1980 to present, Sprint is 95% confident that the fair value of outstanding debt would not increase above Sprints book value over the next six months. Foreign Currency Risk Sprint also enters into forward contracts and options in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Sprint uses foreign currency derivatives to hedge its net foreign currency payable related to settlement of international telecommunications access charges. The dollar equivalent of Sprints net foreign currency payables was $3 million at December 31, 2001. The potential immediate pre tax loss to Sprint that would result from a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates based on these positions would be approximately $635 thousand.
