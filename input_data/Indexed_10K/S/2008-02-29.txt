Overview We are a global communications company offering a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications products and services that are designed to meet the needs of individual consumers, businesses and government customers. We have organized our operations to meet the needs of our targeted customer groups through focused communications solutions that incorporate the capabilities of our wireless and wireline services to meet their specific needs. We are one of the three largest wireless companies in the United States based on the number of wireless subscribers. We also are one of the largest providers of wireline long distance services and one of the largest carriers of Internet traffic in the nation. We own extensive wireless networks and a global long distance, Tier 1 Internet backbone. On December 17, 2007, Daniel R. Hesse joined our company as President and Chief Executive Officer. Senior management is currently reviewing our operations and assessing our strategies and future business plans. 35 Table of Contents This process is still ongoing and, depending on the outcome, our operations, future capital requirements and future valuation of our long lived assets could be affected. As part of our overall business strategy, we regularly evaluate opportunities to strengthen our business and may at any time be discussing or negotiating a transaction that, if consummated, could have a material effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations. As a result, the forward looking information provided in this document is based only on information currently available to senior management. We believe the communications industry has been and will continue to be highly competitive on the basis of price, the types of services and devices offered and quality of service. Although we believe that many of our targeted customers base their purchase decisions on quality of service and the availability of differentiated features and services, competitive pricing, both in terms of the monthly recurring charges and the number of minutes or other features available under a particular rate plan, and handset offerings and pricing are often important factors in potential customers purchase decisions. The FCC regulates the licensing, operation, acquisition and sale of the licensed radio spectrum that is essential to our business. The FCC and state Public Utilities Commissions, or PUCs, also regulate the provision of communications services. Future changes in regulations or legislation related to spectrum licensing or other matters related to our business could impose significant additional costs on us either in the form of direct out of pocket costs or additional compliance obligations Business Segments We have two reportable segments: Wireless and Wireline. See note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our segments. Wireless Products and Services Our strategy is to utilize state of the art technology to provide differentiated wireless services and applications in order to acquire and retain high quality wireless subscribers. We offer a wide array of wireless mobile telephone and wireless data transmission services on networks that utilize CDMA and iDEN technologies to meet the needs of individual consumers, businesses and government customers. Through our Wireless segment, we, together with the PCS Affiliates and resellers of our wholesale wireless services, offer digital wireless service in all 50 states, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and provide wireless coverage in 360 metropolitan markets, including 341 of the 349 largest U.S. metropolitan areas, serving about 54 million wireless subscribers as of December 31, 2007. We offer wireless international voice roaming for subscribers of both CDMA and iDEN based services in numerous countries. Our CDMA network utilizes high speed evolution data optimized, or EV DO, technology to provide high speed data applications. We have incorporated EV DO Rev. A, the most recent version of EV DO technology that is designed to support a variety of IP, video and high performance walkie talkie applications, into over 82% of our CDMA network. We offer a wide array of wireless mobile telephone and data transmission services and features in a variety of pricing plans, typically on a contract basis, for one or two year periods. Services are billed on a monthly basis according to the applicable pricing plan, which typically includes a fixed charge for certain services and variable charges for other services. We also offer wireless services that focus on the youth market, including our Boost Mobile prepaid wireless service on our iDEN network and our Boost UnlimitedSM local calling wireless service on our CDMA network. We also offer wholesale CDMA based wireless services to resellers, commonly known as MVNOs, such as Qwest Communications International, Inc., Virgin Mobile USA, Helio Inc., Movida Communications, Inc., and Embarq, which purchase wireless services from us at wholesale rates and resell the services to their customers under their own brand names. Under these MVNO arrangements, the operators bear the costs of subscriber acquisition, billing and customer service. 36 Table of Contents We offer a broad portfolio of data services across our CDMA network, including data messaging, photo and video offerings, entertainment and location based applications, marketed as Power VisionSM, and mobile broadband applications for laptops and other devices. On our iDEN network, we continue to support features and services designed to meet the needs of our customers. Both the Nextel and prepaid Boost Mobile brands feature our industry leading walkie talkie services, which give subscribers the ability to communicate instantly across the continental United States and to and from Hawaii and, through agreements with other iDEN providers, to and from select markets in Canada, Latin America and Mexico, as well as a variety of digital wireless mobile telephone and wireless data transmission services. We offer some data services on the iDEN network, but that network does not support a full complement of data services and many of those services are available only with limited capabilities. We offer devices that operate seamlessly between our CDMA and iDEN networks marketed as PowerSourceTM that enable us to offer wireless service that combines our CDMA based voice and data applications and our iDEN based walkie talkie applications. We are focusing our sales efforts of PowerSource devices on existing subscribers of certain iDEN services to offer them the benefit of higher data speeds on CDMA. In addition, we are also improving our product and service offerings on our iDEN network, which will include the introduction of several new handsets in 2008. We plan to utilize QUALCOMM Incorporateds QChat&reg; technology, which is designed to provide high performance walkie talkie services on our CDMA network, and we are designing interfaces to provide for interoperability of walkie talkie services on our CDMA and iDEN networks. Upon successful launch of QChat devices, we expect that they will succeed the PowerSource devices. Currently, we are testing the QChat application on our CDMA network and our goal is to launch commercial service offerings in 2008. For information regarding a dispute involving the intellectual property rights of QUALCOMM that relate to QChat, see Item 1A. Risk Factors The intellectual property rights utilized by us and our suppliers and service providers may infringe on intellectual property rights owned by others. Service Revenue Our Wireless segment generates revenues from the provision of wireless services, the sale of wireless equipment and the provision of wholesale and other services. The ability of our Wireless segment to generate service revenues is primarily a function of: the number of subscribers that we serve, which in turn is a function of our ability to acquire new and retain existing subscribers; and the revenue generated from each subscriber, which in turn is a function of the types and amount of services utilized by each subscriber and the rates that we charge for those services. The declines in our subscriber base and revenue generated from each subscriber group discussed below have resulted in a decline in service revenue. Post Paid and Prepaid Subscribers The wireless industry is subject to intense competition, which impacts our ability to attract and retain subscribers for wireless services. Most markets in which we operate have very high rates of penetration for wireless services, which will limit the growth of subscribers of wireless services. Consequently, we believe that wireless carriers must attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from the existing customer bases of competitors rather than from first time purchasers of wireless services. Because of high penetration rates, first time purchasers of wireless services tend to have lower credit ratings or no credit history. As a result, wireless carriers have focused considerable efforts on the care and service of existing subscribers and retention of valued customers. Some of our competitors have reported significant improvements in their post paid customer retention rates (i.e., rates of customer churn). The combination of decreased rates of churn of some of our competitors, together with a slowing in the rate of subscriber growth, has reduced the pool of potential subscribers making wireless service provider decisions. 37 Table of Contents Below is a table showing (a) net additions (losses) for the past twelve quarters of direct subscribers for our iDEN and CDMA networks, excluding subscribers obtained through business combinations, existing subscribers who have migrated between networks and indirect subscribers of MVNOs and PCS Affiliates, (b) our total iDEN and CDMA post paid subscribers as of each of the quarters in 2005, 2006 and 2007, and (c) our average rates of monthly post paid and prepaid customer churn for the past twelve quarters.

To effect this change, the subscriber base as of October 1, 2006 was increased by 436,000 subscribers. We adjusted our subscriber beginning balance so as to not increase our direct net subscriber additions or decrease the customer churn rates for the fourth quarter 2006 due to this policy change. (2) Includes subscribers with PowerSource devices, introduced in the fourth quarter 2006. (3) During the third quarter 2007, we implemented an additional churn rule to remove the impact of activations and deactivations occurring within 30 days in the same account. The new rule, which we believe presents a more precise churn calculation, reduced churn by 10 basis points to 2.3% in the third quarter 2007. The additional churn rule did not impact reported net additions or results of operations. Prior period churn figures have not been adjusted for this additional churn rule. 38 Table of Contents During 2007, we endeavored to retain subscribers and attract new subscribers by improving our customer care and sales and distribution functions. In addition, we took other actions in an effort to improve our customers experience including improving our network performance by adding cell sites to expand the coverage and capacity of our networks, enhancing our brand awareness by increased media spending, and broadening our handset portfolio primarily through the introduction of new CDMA and PowerSource handsets. We added about 1.6 million net post paid subscribers on the CDMA network in 2007; however, we have experienced a continued decline in the number of new post paid CDMA subscribers in the fourth quarter 2007. Competitive marketing conditions including increased advertising and promotions by our competitors have contributed to the decline in the number of new customers. Earlier in the year, we adjusted our credit policy in certain markets in an effort to attract new subscribers. In late 2007, we adjusted our credit policies and returned to policy standards similar to those in mid 2006, which also contributed to the decline in subscriber additions on our CDMA platform in the fourth quarter 2007. We continually monitor and adjust our credit policies in an effort to attract desirable and profitable customers, including our lower credit quality customers. Our ratio of subscribers with a subprime credit rating to those with a prime credit rating has decreased slightly from the fourth quarter 2006. Refer to Results of Operations Segment Results of Operations Wireless Wireless Segment Earnings below for a discussion of subscriber trends. We have experienced declines in the number of new iDEN post paid subscribers in recent quarters and we lost about 2.8 million net post paid subscribers on this network during 2007. Consumer sentiment regarding the iDEN network, reduced marketing programs and limited new handset offerings at higher than market prices have all contributed to the decline in new iDEN customers. We calculate churn by dividing net subscriber deactivations for the quarter by the sum of the average number of subscribers for each month in the quarter. Net subscriber deactivations are used in the numerator of the churn calculation. For accounts comprised of multiple subscribers, such as family plans and enterprise accounts, net deactivations are defined as deactivations in excess of customer activations in a particular account within 30 days. Post paid churn consists of both voluntary churn, where the subscriber makes his or her own determination to cease being a customer, and involuntary churn, where we terminate the customers service due to a lack of payment or other reasons. Involuntary deactivations represent slightly over half of all deactivations on our CDMA network in 2007. Although overall post paid churn was relatively flat in 2007 as compared to 2006, post paid churn on our iDEN platform increased, which was offset by reduced post paid churn on our CDMA platform. Voluntary churn on the iDEN network has been adversely impacted by customer sentiment related to: the network, limited handset offerings at higher than market prices, and customer care experience. Our overall 2007 post paid churn remains high relative to that of our competitors for the same reasons. Prepaid subscriber churn increased as compared to 2006, primarily due to competition in our prepaid and youth markets from new entrants. Refer to Results of Operations Segment Results of Operations Wireless Wireless Segment Earnings below for a discussion of churn trends. Average Revenue per Subscriber Below is a table showing our average revenue per post paid and prepaid subscriber for the past twelve quarters. Quarter Ended March 31,2005 June 30,2005 September 30,2005 December 31,2005 March 31,2006 June 30,2006 September 30,2006 December 31,2006 March 31,2007 June 30,2007 September 30,2007 December 31,2007 Average monthly service revenue per user Direct post paid $ 61 $ 62 $ 63 $ 63 $ 62 $ 62 $ 61 $ 60 $ 59 $ 60 $ 59 $ 58 Direct prepaid $ 37 $ 37 $ 36 $ 34 $ 33 $ 32 $ 32 $ 31 $ 30 $ 28 Average monthly service revenue per subscriber for the quarter is calculated by dividing our quarterly service revenue by the sum of our average number of subscribers for each month in the quarter. Changes in average monthly post paid service revenue are due to changes in the rate plans we offer and usage of our service and applications by subscribers. The decline in our average monthly voice revenue is primarily due to the loss of subscribers with higher priced service plans, while new subscribers and the subscribers acquired from the PCS Affiliates have lower priced service plans. In addition, the decline is partly attributable to the migration of our existing customers to family add on plans or plans that include roaming in their service plan, as well as increased sales to businesses and the government, which receive favorable 39 Table of Contents volume based pricing. In addition to our standard voice plans, we offer data plans or add on plans that provide our customers offerings such as short message service, or SMS, connection cards and our Sprint Vision and Power Vision service plan. As these products and services are becoming increasingly popular with our customers, the decline in the average voice revenue per subscriber is being partially offset by an increase in the average data revenue per post paid subscriber. There is no assurance that data service revenue per subscriber will continue to grow at current rates or eventually offset the declines in voice revenue. Segment Earnings Wireless segment earnings is primarily a function of wireless service revenue, costs to acquire subscribers, network and interconnection costs to serve those subscribers and other Wireless segment operating expenses. The costs to acquire our customers includes the net cost at which we sell our handsets, referred to as handset subsidies, as well as the marketing and sales costs incurred to attract those customers. Network costs primarily represent switch and cell site costs and interconnection costs generally consist of per minute use fees and roaming fees paid to other carriers. The remaining costs associated with operating the Wireless segment include the costs to operate our customer care organization, back office support and bad debt expense. Wireless service revenue, costs to acquire subscribers, and network and interconnection costs are generally variable in nature and fluctuate with the growth in our subscriber base but certain elements are fixed. 800 Megahertz Spectrum Reconfiguration Under the FCCs Report and Order, we are required to complete a reconfiguration plan that is designed to eliminate interference with public safety operators in the 800 MHz spectrum band through a spectrum reallocation that will result in more efficient use of 800 MHz spectrum. For a more detailed discussion of the Report and Order and its impact on us, see Item 1. BusinessLegislative and Regulatory Developments Regulations and Wireless Operations800 MHz Band Spectrum Reconfiguration. The Report and Order implemented rules to reconfigure spectrum in the 800 MHz band in a 36 month phased transition process. We surrendered certain portions of our holdings in the 800 MHz spectrum band and are obligated to fund the cost incurred by public safety systems and other incumbent licensees to reconfigure the 800 MHz spectrum band. As part of this process, in most markets, we must cease using portions of 800 MHz spectrum during the reconfiguration before we are able to commence use of replacement 800 MHz spectrum. Based on the terms of the Report and Order and subsequent FCC and 800 MHz Transition Administrator, or TA, actions, we have been planning and implementing spectrum exchanges with each affected public safety agency based upon that agencys ability to complete the reconfiguration process, thereby limiting the time from when we cease using the surrendered spectrum and when the replacement spectrum is available for our use. In September 2007, the FCC issued an order, the Third MO&O, that, among other things, requires that by June 2008 we vacate many 800 MHz channels that we currently use, even if the applicable public safety licensee is not ready to relocate to the vacated spectrum, which could result in a sudden and significant decrease in network capacity, which in turn would adversely affect the performance of our iDEN network. We have appealed this order in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. If this order is not overturned or modified, we could attempt to construct additional sites or acquire additional spectrum, to the extent possible. In those markets where these network investments are not possible, we may be required to curtail subscriber additions and incent certain existing subscribers of iDEN services to use PowerSource devices or move to our CDMA network until the capacity limitation can be alleviated, particularly if the replacement 800 MHz spectrum is not available for an extended length of time. Degradation in network performance in any market could result in higher subscriber churn in that market. The loss of a significant number of subscribers could adversely affect our results of operations. Based on the FCCs determination of the values of the spectrum rights received and surrendered, the minimum obligation to be incurred under the Report and Order is $2.8 billion. The Report and Order also 40 Table of Contents provides that qualifying costs we incur as part of the reconfiguration plan, including costs to reconfigure our own infrastructure and spectrum positions, can be used to offset the minimum obligation of $2.8 billion; however, we are obligated to pay the full amount of the costs relating to the reconfiguration plan, even if those costs exceed that amount. In addition, a financial reconciliation is required to be completed at the end of the reconfiguration implementation to determine whether the value of the spectrum rights received exceeds the total of (i) the value of spectrum rights that are surrendered and (ii) the qualifying costs referred to above. If so, we will be required to pay the difference to the U.S. Treasury, as described above. Based on the FCCs determination of the values of the spectrum rights received and surrendered by Nextel, the minimum obligation to be incurred under the Report and Order is $2.8 billion. The Report and Order also provides that qualifying costs we incur as part of the reconfiguration plan, including costs to reconfigure our own infrastructure and spectrum positions, can be used to offset the minimum obligation of $2.8 billion; however, we are obligated to pay the full amount of the costs relating to the reconfiguration plan, even if those costs exceed that amount. From the inception of the program and through December 31, 2007, we have incurred approximately $1.1 billion of costs directly attributable to the spectrum reconfiguration program. This amount does not include any of our internal network costs that we have preliminarily allocated to the reconfiguration program for capacity sites and modifications for which we may request credit under the reconfiguration program. If we are successful in our appeal of the Third MO&O, we estimate, based on our experience to date with the reconfiguration program and on information currently available, that our total direct costs attributable to complete the spectrum reconfiguration will range between $2.7 billion and $3.4 billion. This estimate is dependent on significant assumptions including the final licensee costs, and costs associated with relocating licensees in the Canadian and Mexican border regions for which there are currently no approved border plans. In addition, the above range does not include any of our apportioned internal network costs. Actual results could differ from such estimates. In addition, we are entitled to receive reimbursement from the mobile satellite service licensees for their pro rata portion of our costs of clearing a portion of the 1.9 GHz spectrum. Those licensees may be unable or unwilling to reimburse us for their share of the costs, which we estimate to be approximately $200 million. If we are unsuccessful in our appeal of the Third MO&O, we anticipate that our costs could exceed $3.4 billion by an amount that would likely be material. However, we believe that it is unlikely we will be required to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury. As required under the terms of the Report and Order, we delivered a $2.5 billion letter of credit to provide assurance that funds will be available to pay the relocation costs of the incumbent users of the 800 MHz spectrum. Although the Report and Order provides for the possibility of periodic reductions in the amount of the letter of credit, no reductions have been requested or made as of December 31, 2007. Wireline Through our Wireline segment, we provide a broad suite of wireline voice and data communications services targeted to domestic business customers, multinational corporations and other communications companies. These services include domestic and international data communications using various protocols, such as MPLS technologies, IP, asynchronous transfer mode, or ATM, frame relay, managed network services and voice services. We also provide services to the cable MSOs that resell our local and long distance service or use our back office systems and network assets in support of their telephone service provided over cable facilities primarily to residential end user customers. We are one of the nations largest providers of long distance services and operate all digital long distance and Tier 1 IP networks. For several years, our long distance voice services have experienced an industry wide trend of lower revenue from lower prices and competition from other wireline and wireless communications companies, as well as cable MSOs and Internet service providers. Growth in voice services provided by cable MSOs is accelerating as consumers use cable MSOs as alternatives to local and long distance voice communications providers. We continue to assess the portfolio of services provided by our Wireline segment and are focusing our efforts on 41 Table of Contents IP based services and de emphasizing stand alone voice services and non IP based data services. For example, in addition to increased emphasis on selling IP and managed services, we are converting existing customers from ATM and frame relay to more advanced IP technologies. This conversion has and will continue to result in decreases in revenue from frame relay and ATM service offset by increases in IP and MPLS services. We also are taking advantage of the growth in voice services provided by cable MSOs, by providing large cable MSOs with wholesale voice local and long distance, which they offer as part of their bundled service offerings, as well as traditional voice and data services for their enterprise use. WiMAX Initiative We plan to deploy a next generation broadband wireless network that will be designed to provide significantly higher data transport speeds using our spectrum holdings in the 2.5 gigahertz, or GHz, band and technology based on the Worldwide Inter Operability for Microwave Access, or WiMAX, standard. We are designing this network to support a wide range of high speed IP based wireless services in a mobile environment. Our initial plans contemplate deploying the new network and introducing commercial service offerings in Chicago, Baltimore and Washington, DC in mid 2008. We are exploring strategic initiatives and third party and other financing alternatives related to this initiative. In 2007, operating expenses related to this initiative totaled $193 million and capital expenditures totaled $384 million. Deployment of this network will continue to require capital resources, without any meaningful revenues, for the foreseeable future. Results of Operations We present consolidated information, as well as separate supplemental financial information for our two reportable segments, Wireless and Wireline. The disaggregated financial results for our two reportable segments have been prepared in a manner that is consistent with the basis and manner in which our executives evaluate segment performance and make resource allocation decisions. Consequently, segment earnings is defined as wireless or wireline operating income before other segment expenses, such as depreciation, amortization, severance, exit costs, asset impairments and other, goodwill impairment, and merger and integration expenses solely and directly attributable to the segment. Expenses and income items excluded from segment earnings are managed at the corporate level. Merger and integration expenses are generally non recurring in nature and primarily include costs for the launch of common customer interfacing systems, processes and other integration and planning activities, certain costs to provide wireless devices that operate seamlessly between the CDMA and iDEN networks, certain customer care costs, costs to retain employees, costs related to re branding, and other integration costs. See note 12 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our segments. For reconciliations of segment earnings to the closest generally accepted accounting principles measure, operating income, see tables set forth in Wireless and Wireline below. We generally account for transactions between segments based on fully distributed costs, which we believe approximate fair value. In certain transactions, pricing is set using market rates. Consolidated Our consolidated and wireless results of operations include the results of the merged and acquired companies from either the date of merger/acquisition or the start of the month closest to the acquisition date. As such, the results of merged and acquired companies are included as of the following dates: Nextel Communications and US Unwired from August 12, 2005; Gulf Coast Wireless Limited Partnership from October 1, 2005; IWO Holdings, Inc. from November 7, 2005; Enterprise Communications Partnership and Alamosa Holdings, Inc. from February 1, 2006; Nextel Partners and UbiquiTel Inc. from July 1, 2006 and Northern PCS Services, LLC from August 1, 2007. The results of Velocita Wireless Holding Corporation are included from the date of acquisition, March 1, 2006, through the date of sale, June 27, 2007. For further information on business combinations, see note 2 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These transactions affect the comparability of our reported operating results with other periods. 42 Table of Contents On May 17, 2006, we spun off to our shareholders our local communications business, which is now known as Embarq Corporation and is comprised primarily of what was our local wireline communications segment prior to the spin off. As a result of the spin off, we no longer own any interest in Embarq. The results of Embarq for periods prior to the spin off are presented as discontinued operations. The following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations. Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 (in millions) Net operating revenues $ 40,146 $ 41,003 $ 28,771 Goodwill impairment 29,729 Income (loss) from continuing operations (29,580 ) 995 821 Discontinued operations, net 334 980 Net income (loss) (29,580 ) 1,329 1,785 Net operating revenues decreased about 2% in 2007 as compared to 2006, reflecting the decrease in revenues from our Wireless segment, principally due to the decrease in wireless equipment revenue, and increased 43% in 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily as a result of the business combinations, partially offset by declining revenues of our Wireline segment. For additional information, see Segment Results of Operations below. Income from continuing operations decreased to a loss of $29.6 billion in 2007, compared to income of $995 million in 2006, primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $29.7 billion. Income from continuing operations increased to $995 million in 2006, as compared to income of $821 million in 2005, primarily due to revenue growth as a result of the business combinations described above, partially offset by increases to cost of service primarily due to higher volume in roaming and interconnection expenses. For additional information, see Segment Results of Operations and Consolidated Information below. In 2007, we incurred a net loss of $29.6 billion as compared to net income of $1.3 billion in 2006, due to the reasons stated above and the absence of income from discontinued operations in 2007. Net income decreased to $1.3 billion in 2006 as compared to net income of $1.8 billion in 2005 primarily as a result of the Embarq spin off. For additional information, see Segment Results of Operations and Consolidated Information below. Presented below are results of operations for our Wireless and Wireline segments, followed by a discussion of consolidated information. 43 Table of Contents Segment Results of Operations Wireless Year Ended December 31, Change from Previous Year 2007 2006 2005 2007 vs 2006 2006 vs 2005 (in millions) Service $ 31,044 $ 31,059 $ 19,289 0 % 61 % Wholesale, affiliate and other 1,061 870 908 22 % (4) % Total services revenue 32,105 31,929 20,197 1 % 58 % Cost of services(1) (8,612 ) (8,058 ) (5,419 ) 7 % 49 % Service gross margin $ 23,493 $ 23,871 $ 14,778 (2) % 62 % Service gross margin percentage 73 % 75 % 73 % Equipment revenue $ 2,595 $ 3,172 $ 2,129 (18) % 49 % Cost of products(1) (5,023 ) (4,927 ) (3,272 ) 2 % 51 % Equipment net subsidy $ (2,428 ) $ (1,755 ) $ (1,143 ) 38 % 54 % Equipment net subsidy percentage (94 )% (55 )% (54 )% Selling, general and administrative expense(1) $ (11,151 ) $ (10,438 ) $ (6,703 ) 7 % 56 % Wireless segment earnings 9,914 11,678 6,932 (15) % 68 % Merger and integration expenses(1) (344 ) (191 ) 80 % NM Severance, exit costs, asset impairments and other, net(2) (394 ) (179 ) (105 ) 120 % 70 % Goodwill impairment(3) (29,729 ) NM NM Depreciation(2) (5,175 ) (5,232 ) (3,364 ) (1) % 56 % Amortization(2) (3,310 ) (3,854 ) (1,335 ) (14) % 189 % Wireless operating income (loss) (29,038 ) 2,222 2,128 NM 4 % NM Not Meaningful (1) Merger and integration expenses are discussed in the Consolidated Information section.

Other expense, net includes net costs associated with the exit of a non core line of business, and for the year ended December 31, 2007 includes charges associated with legal contingencies and insurance recoveries. (3) During 2007, we recognized a $29.7 billion non cash impairment charge to goodwill related to the Wireless segment, which is recorded as a component of operating income. Goodwill impairment is further discussed in the Consolidated Information section. Service Revenue Service revenues consist of fixed monthly recurring charges, variable usage charges and miscellaneous fees such as activation fees, directory assistance, operator assisted calling, equipment protection, late payment and early termination charges and certain regulatory related fees. Service revenue totaled $31.0 billion in 2007, $31.1 billion in 2006 and $19.3 billion in 2005. 44 Table of Contents The following is a summary of our average subscribers and average revenue per subscriber for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006 and 2005. The number of subscribers impacts service revenues, cost of service and bad debt expense, as well as support costs, such as customer care and billing, which are included in general and administrative expenses. A summary of changes in net additions to subscribers and average monthly revenue per subscriber for each of the last three years may be found on pages 38 and 39.

(2) The average subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2007 are inclusive of 170,000 subscribers acquired through our 2007 acquisition of Northern PCS, compared to 4,156,000 subscribers acquired through our 2006 acquisitions of certain PCS Affiliates and Nextel Partners, and 17,989,000 and 860,000 subscribers acquired through the 2005 Sprint Nextel merger and the acquisitions of certain PCS Affiliates. Service revenues decreased $15 million or less than 1% in 2007 as compared to 2006, due to: a decrease of approximately $220 million in service revenue from our direct post paid subscribers. This decrease is due primarily to a decline in average monthly service revenue per post paid user, attributable to a decrease in the average monthly voice revenue per post paid user, which is only partially offset by an increase in the average monthly data revenue per post paid user. This decline is partially offset by an increase in revenue attributable to the increase in the weighted average number of direct post paid subscribers; offset by a net increase of approximately $205 million in service revenue from our prepaid subscribers. This increase is due primarily to an increase in the average number of direct prepaid subscribers, partially offset by a decline in average monthly service revenue per prepaid subscriber. Service revenues increased $11.8 billion or 61% in 2006 as compared to 2005, due to: a net increase of approximately $10.8 billion in service revenue from our direct post paid subscribers, due primarily to an increase in the average number of direct post paid subscribers, most of which were acquired in the Sprint Nextel merger; and a net increase of approximately $1.0 billion in service revenue from our prepaid subscribers, due primarily to an increase in the average number of direct prepaid subscribers, most of which were acquired in the Sprint Nextel merger. The net increase in post paid subscribers is a function of several factors. We believe that other than the subscribers acquired through business combinations, new subscribers are attracted to our differentiated products and services, particularly CDMA based data related services, including those available under our Sprint Power Vision service plans, and other non voice services. Within our existing customer base in 2007, 1.6 million 45 Table of Contents subscribers, including over 400,000 subscribers in the fourth quarter, transferred from our iDEN subscriber base to take advantage of these products and services, which include data cards, downloading music, global positioning satellite, or GPS, enabled navigation services, instant messaging and emails, sending and receiving pictures, playing on line games, browsing the Internet wirelessly, and with our PowerSource handsets, using CDMA based voice and data applications and our iDEN based walkie talkie applications. Offsetting the increase in CDMA subscribers, we have also experienced a continued decline in iDEN subscribers in addition to those that transferred from the iDEN subscriber base to the CDMA subscriber base. We believe that this decline was due in part to customer sentiment related to: the network, limited handset offerings at higher than market prices and customer care experience. See subscriber trends discussed in Wireless Segment Earnings below. The average monthly service revenue per post paid subscriber generally decreased year over year due primarily to declines in voice revenue per subscriber. This decline is primarily due to the loss of subscribers with higher priced service plans, while new subscribers and the subscribers acquired from the PCS Affiliates have lower priced service plans. In addition, the decline is partly attributable to the migration of our existing customers to family add on plans or plans that include roaming in their service plan, as well as increased sales to businesses and the government, which receive favorable volume based pricing. This decline in the average voice revenue per subscriber is partially offset by an increase in the average data revenue per post paid subscriber, which is attributable to our CDMA based data offerings such as short message service, or SMS, connection cards and our Sprint Vision and Power Vision service plans. The decrease in the average monthly service revenue per prepaid subscriber in the year ended December 31, 2007 is due in part to a decrease in usage of wireless services by our existing customers. See average monthly service revenue per post paid subscriber trends discussed in Wireless Segment Earnings below. Wholesale, Affiliate and Other Revenue Wholesale, affiliate and other revenues consist primarily of revenues from the sale of wireless services to companies that resell those services to their subscribers and net revenues retained from wireless subscribers residing in PCS Affiliate territories. Wholesale, affiliate and other revenues increased 22% in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to increases in our wholesale operators subscribers. Wholesale, affiliate and other revenues decreased 4% in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to the PCS Affiliate acquisitions. In 2007, wholesale subscriber additions were 1.3 million, resulting in about 7.7 million wholesale subscribers at December 31, 2007, compared to about 6.4 million wholesale subscribers at December 31, 2006 and 5.2 million wholesale subscribers at December 31, 2005. Cost of Services Cost of services consists primarily of: costs to operate and maintain our CDMA and iDEN networks, including direct switch and cell site costs, such as rent, utilities, maintenance, payroll costs associated with our network engineering employees and frequency leasing costs; fixed and variable interconnection costs, the fixed component of which consists of monthly flat rate fees for facilities leased from local exchange carriers based on the number of cell sites and switches in service in a particular period and the related equipment installed at each site, and the variable component of which generally consists of per minute use fees charged by wireline and wireless providers for calls terminating on their networks, which fluctuates in relation to the level and duration of those terminating calls; long distance costs paid to the wireline business; costs to service and repair handsets and activate service for new subscribers; 46 Table of Contents roaming fees paid to other carriers; and variable costs relating to payments to third parties for the use of their proprietary data applications, such as ringers, games, music, TV and navigation by our customers. Cost of services increased 7% in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to increased costs relating to the expansion of our network and increased minutes of use on our networks. Specifically, we experienced: an increase in roaming expenses, primarily with respect to subscribers of our CDMA services, due to increased data and voice usage outside of our CDMA network; and an increase in cell site and switch related operational costs, including increases in rent and fixed and variable interconnection costs due to the increase in usage, number of cell sites and related equipment in service. Cost of services increased 49% in 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily due to increased costs resulting from the Sprint Nextel merger. Service gross margin declined 2% in 2007 as compared to 2006 and increased 62% in 2006 as compared to 2005, due to the reasons described above. As a percentage of total service revenue, service gross margin decreased slightly to 73% in 2007 from 75% in 2006 and 73% in 2005. Equipment Revenue We recognize equipment revenue when title to the handset or accessory passes to the dealer or end user customer. We reduce equipment revenue for certain payments to third party dealers, which reimburse the dealer for point of sale discounts that are offered to the end user subscriber. Revenues from sales of handsets and accessories decreased 18% in 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily due to a decrease in the average sales price of handsets due to more aggressive acquisition and retention handset pricing, which was only slightly offset by an increase in the number of handsets sold. Revenues from sales of handsets and accessories increased 49% in 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily due to additional handsets sold due to the Sprint Nextel merger and the PCS Affiliate and Nextel Partners acquisitions. Cost of Products We recognize the cost of handsets and accessories when title to the handset or accessory passes to the dealer or end user customer. Cost of handsets and accessories also includes order fulfillment related expenses and write downs of handset and related accessory inventory for shrinkage and obsolescence. The cost of handsets is reduced by any rebates that we earn from the supplier. Handset and accessory costs increased 2% in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to the increase in the number of handsets sold and an increase in the average cost of the units sold as we continue to sell higher priced units with more functionality. Handset and accessory costs increased 51% in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to additional handsets sold due to the Sprint Nextel merger and the PCS Affiliate and Nextel Partners acquisitions. Subsidy Our marketing plans assume that handsets typically will be sold at prices below our cost, which is consistent with industry practice. Our subscriber retention efforts often include providing incentives to customers such as offering new handsets at discounted prices. Handset costs in excess of the revenues generated from handset sales (referred to in our industry as subsidy) as a percentage of equipment revenues increased to 94% in 2007 from 55% in 2006 and 54% in 2005, as a result of efforts to promote the acquisition of new and retention of existing subscribers. 47 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expense Sales and marketing costs primarily consist of customer acquisition costs, including commissions paid to our indirect dealers, third party distributors and direct sales force for new handset activations and upgrades, residual payments to our indirect dealers, payroll and facilities costs associated with our direct sales force, retail stores and marketing employees, advertising, media programs and sponsorships, including costs related to branding. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for billing, customer care and information technology operations, bad debt expense and back office support activities, including collections, legal, finance, human resources, strategic planning and technology and product development. Sales and marketing expense increased about 9% in 2007 from 2006 as compared to an increase of 47% in 2006 from 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we experienced increased advertising expense, reflecting our renewed focus on promoting our brand in an effort to gain market share by attracting new subscribers and continuing to build loyalty among existing subscribers, and we increased compensation of our post paid third party dealers for both new subscriber additions and upgrades. General and administrative costs increased about 5% in 2007 from 2006 as compared to an increase of 67% in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to increases in bad debt expense resulting from higher average write offs per account and increases in customer care costs due to higher call volumes and additional customer care representatives. These costs were partially offset by decreases in IT and billing costs due to application rationalization, including financial reporting and billing system consolidations. Bad debt expense increased $262 million in 2007 to $896 million, as compared to a $168 million increase in 2006 to $634 million. The 2007 increase was primarily the result of higher average write offs per account, which accounted for about 77% of the increase in bad debt. Increases in the average write offs per account can be attributed to a higher number of subscribers per account, increased add a phone activity, increased incidence of overages, increased fees related to data services and increased credit extended in early 2007 and 2006. The 2006 increase is primarily attributable to the increase in the number of subscribers, including subscribers acquired through acquisitions, and an increase in involuntary churn. Wireless Segment Earnings Wireless segment earnings decreased about $1.8 billion or 15% in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to increases in costs to acquire our subscribers, due to lower equipment revenue, and increases in network and interconnection costs. Wireless segment earnings increased $4.7 billion or 68% in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to increased revenue resulting from additional subscribers acquired in connection with the Sprint Nextel merger and the PCS Affiliate and Nextel Partners acquisitions. Based on information currently available to management, we expect to experience continued downward pressure on Wireless segment earnings in the near term, including a significant reduction in the first quarter 2008 as compared to our Wireless segment earnings of about $2.2 billion in the fourth quarter 2007. Specifically, we expect service revenue to continue to decline in the near term due to expected declines in the number of new subscribers and increases in churn including churn on our CDMA network for the reasons discussed on page 39, as well as a decline in our average monthly service revenue per user as growth from our data services is expected to only partially offset declines in voice services. In addition, because we plan to lower the prices of certain handset devices, our equipment net subsidy may increase, which could increase the overall cost to acquire subscribers. Although management has implemented a program designed to rationalize our cost structure by reducing our workforce, decreasing the number of external contractors and eliminating poor performing distribution points, we do not expect that these cost reductions will offset the expected service revenue declines and increases in net equipment subsidy described above.

(2) Severance, exit costs and asset impairments and depreciation and amortization are discussed in the Consolidated Information section. Other expense includes charges associated with legal contingencies for the year ended December 31, 2007. Total Net Services Revenues Total net services revenues decreased 1% in 2007 as compared to 2006 and decreased 4% in 2006 as compared to 2005, primarily as a result of a lower priced product mix, as well as volume decreases associated with the reduction in our customer base, which is a result of our exit from several businesses described below. This decrease was partially offset by a higher volume of minutes in our affiliate business and growth in our VoIP business. Voice Revenues Voice revenues decreased 7% in 2007 as compared to 2006 and decreased 9% in 2006 as compared to 2005. The 2007 decrease was primarily a result of certain business customers that were transferred to Embarq as part of the spin off in the second quarter 2006, as well as a decrease in our customer base and continued price declines. Also contributing to the decrease is the loss of conference line customers due to the final transition of those activities in the third quarter 2006 as part of the sale of that business. The 2006 decrease also reflects the sale of our unbundled network element platform, or UNE P, customers in the first quarter 2006. Our retail business experienced a decrease in voice revenues of 22% in 2007 as compared to 2006, and a decrease of 25% in 2006 as compared to 2005. The 2007 decrease was primarily due to the loss of accounts related to the Embarq spin off, the sale of our conference line business and lower prices. The 2006 decrease was primarily due to increased competition, which resulted in lower prices per minute notwithstanding increased minute volumes. Our business trends continue to shift away from the retail business and toward the wholesale business. Voice revenues related to our wholesale business increased 1% in 2007 as compared to 2006 and increased about 19% in 2006 as compared to 2005. Minute volume increases accounted for the 2007 and 2006 increases, primarily as a result of our relationship with Embarq. We began providing wholesale long distance services to Embarq following the spin off. Rate declines slightly offset the minute volume increase. 49 Table of Contents Voice revenues generated from the provision of services to the Wireless segment represented 23% of total voice revenues in 2007 as compared to 17% in 2006 and 14% in 2005. Data Revenues Data revenues reflect sales of legacy data services, including ATM, frame relay and managed network services. Data revenues decreased 16% in 2007 as compared to 2006 and decreased 12% in 2006 as compared to 2005 due to declines in frame relay and ATM services as customers migrated to IP based technologies. These declines were partially offset by growth in managed network services. Internet Revenues Internet revenues reflect sales of IP based data services, including MPLS. Internet revenues increased 38% in 2007 as compared to 2006 and increased 38% in 2006 as compared to 2005. The increases were due to higher IP revenues as business customers increasingly migrate to MPLS services, as well as revenue growth in our cable VoIP business, which experienced a 80% increase in 2007 as compared to 2006 and an 127% increase in 2006 as compared to 2005. Other Revenues Other revenues, which primarily consists of sales of customer premises equipment, or CPE, decreased 22% in 2007 as compared to 2006 and decreased 13% in 2006 as compared to 2005 as a result of fewer projects in 2007 and 2006. Costs of Services and Products Costs of services and products include access costs paid to local phone companies, other domestic service providers and foreign phone companies to complete calls made by our domestic customers, costs to operate and maintain our networks and costs of equipment. Costs of services and products decreased 1% in 2007 from 2006 and increased 2% in 2006 from 2005. The decrease in 2007 relates to decreased costs due to declining volumes and improved access cost rates in the retail business, partially offset by increased activity in the wholesale and cable VoIP businesses. The increase in 2006 relates primarily to network costs to support growth in our cable initiatives in addition to increased domestic access volume, partially offset by fewer CPE projects in 2006, the loss of UNE P customers and renegotiated access rate agreements and initiatives to reduce access circuit costs. Service gross margin percentage decreased from 36% in 2005 to 32% in 2006 to 31% in 2007, primarily as a result of declining net services revenue and a lower margin product mix. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense decreased 13% in 2007 as compared to 2006 and decreased 23% in 2006 as compared to 2005. The 2007 decline was due primarily to recognition of a prepaid license from Vonage covering the use of certain patents within our patent portfolio, as well as a reduction in employee headcount, reduced commissions as a result of the spin off of Embarq and decreased customer care and billing expenses due to a smaller customer base. These declines were partially offset by increases in costs associated with cable VoIP support. The 2006 decline was due primarily to decreased marketing and advertising as a result of a change in the mix of marketing strategies and lower general and administrative and information technology expenses. Selling, general and administrative expense includes charges for estimated bad debt expense. Each quarter we reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts based on customer specific indicators, as well as historical trends and industry data, to ensure we are adequately reserved. In 2007, bad debt expense increased slightly primarily due to customer specific reserves. The improvement between 2006 and 2005 reflects improved trends in collections and agings. 50 Table of Contents Total selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net services revenues was 15% in 2007, 16% in 2006 and 21% in 2005. Wireline Segment Earnings Wireline segment earnings increased $83 million or 8% in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to an increase in internet revenue, and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses due to the recognition of the Vonage prepaid license, partially offset by decreases in voice and data revenue. Wireline segment earnings decreased $43 million or 4% in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to voice revenue declines related to customer migrations to alternate sources such as cable and wireless. In 2008, we expect to see continued revenue growth in IP services, offset by declines in voice revenues due to lower pricing on commercial contracts and continued pressure in the long distance market. In addition, increased competition and the excess capacity resulting from new technologies and networks may result in further price reductions. See Forward Looking Statements.

The selling, general and administrative expenses related to the Wireless segment were $11.2 billion in 2007, $10.4 billion in 2006 and $6.7 billion in 2005. The selling, general and administrative expenses related to the Wireline segment were $943 million in 2007, $1.1 billion in 2006 and $1.4 billion in 2005. In addition to the selling, general and administrative expenses discussed in the segment earnings discussions, we incurred corporate general and administrative expenses of $359 million in 2007, $246 million in 2006 and $649 million in 2005, including certain merger and integration expenses of $172 million in 2007, $222 million in 2006 and $580 million in 2005 as discussed in Merger and Integration Expenses below. Also included in corporate general and administrative expenses are expenses related to our planned deployment of a next generation broadband wireless network, and such expenses are expected to increase in future quarters. 51 Table of Contents Merger and Integration Expenses We incurred $516 million of merger and integration expenses in 2007, $413 million in 2006 and $580 million in 2005, of which $344 million and $191 million are included in our Wireless segment for 2007 and 2006, respectively, as the expenses are solely and directly attributable to that segment. These expenses are generally classified as selling, general and administrative and cost of products as appropriate on our consolidated statement of operations. Merger and integration expenses that are not solely and directly attributable to the Wireless segment are included in our Corporate segment and are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses. Merger and integration expenses increased in 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily due to costs to provide wireless devices that operate seamlessly between the CDMA and iDEN networks. Merger and integration expenses decreased in 2006 as compared to 2005 primarily due to reduced rebranding, internal labor and retention costs offset by increased system rationalization costs. Severance, Exit Costs and Asset Impairments During 2007, we had asset impairments of $163 million, which related to the write off of network assets, including site development costs, that we determined would not be used based on managements strategic network plans, the loss on the sale of Velocita Wireless, and the closing of retail stores due to integration activities. We wrote off $69 million of assets in 2006 and $44 million of assets in 2005 primarily related to software asset impairments. We recorded severance and exit costs of $277 million in 2007 related to the separation of employees, exit costs primarily associated with the sale of Velocita Wireless and continued organizational realignment initiatives associated with the Sprint Nextel merger and the PCS Affiliate and Nextel Partners acquisitions. In 2006, we recorded $138 million in severance and exit costs primarily related to our realignment initiatives associated with the Sprint Nextel merger and integration initiatives. Goodwill Impairment In the fourth quarter 2007, we performed our annual assessment of impairment for goodwill. As a result of this assessment, which is described in note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of $29.7 billion. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation expense in 2007 remained flat as compared to 2006. The 2007 depreciation expense includes about a $400 million decrease related to depreciation rate changes with respect to our CDMA and Wireline networks assets, resulting from our annual depreciable lives study. These rate changes are primarily related to certain assets becoming fully depreciated and net changes in service lives of certain assets. The decreases resulting from the depreciation rate changes were fully offset by normal additions to our network asset base. Depreciation expense increased 48% in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to the Sprint Nextel merger and the PCS Affiliate and Nextel Partners acquisitions. Amortization expense decreased 14% in 2007 from 2006, primarily due to decreases in the amortization of the customer relationships acquired as part of the Sprint Nextel merger, which are amortized using the sum of the years digits method, resulting in higher amortization rates in early periods that decline over time. Amortization expense increased $2.5 billion in 2006 from 2005, primarily due to the amortization of the value of customer relationships and other definite lived intangible assets acquired in connection with the Sprint Nextel merger and the PCS Affiliate and Nextel Partners acquisitions. See note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our definite lived intangible assets. 52 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense in 2007 decreased 7% as compared to 2006, primarily reflecting the reduction in our average debt balance. The effective interest rate on our average long term debt balance of $21.8 billion in 2007 was 6.9%, unchanged from 2006 based on an average long term debt balance of $23.2 billion. The effective interest rate includes the effect of interest rate swap agreements. As of December 31, 2007, the average floating rate of interest on the interest rate swaps was 8.0%, while the weighted average coupon on the underlying debt was 7.2%. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information on our financing activities. Interest Income Interest income includes dividends received from certain investments in equity securities and interest earned on marketable debt securities and cash equivalents. In 2007, interest income decreased 50%, as compared to 2006, primarily due to a decrease in the average commercial paper held, as well as a decrease in the average temporary cash investments balance. In 2006, interest income increased 28% as compared to 2005, primarily due to the higher interest rates on the cash equivalents balances as well as interest income recognized in relation to a favorable tax audit settlement for the years 1995 to 2002. The 2006 increase was partially offset by the decrease in cash investment balances due to debt retirements, purchases of common stock and acquisitions. Equity in Earnings (Losses) of Unconsolidated Investees, net Under the equity method of accounting, we record our proportional share of the earnings or losses of the companies in which we have invested and have the ability to exercise significant influence over, up to the amount of our investment in the case of losses. We recorded $3 million of equity method losses during 2007. We recorded $6 million of equity method losses during 2006, primarily due to our ownership interests in E wireless. We recorded $107 million of equity method earnings in 2005 primarily related to Nextel Partners. Realized Gain on Sale or Exchange of Investments During 2007, we recognized a gain from the sale of investments of $253 million, primarily due to a pre tax gain of $240 million related to the sale of a portion of our equity interest in Virgin Mobile USA, LLC, or VMU. See note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. During 2006, we recognized a gain from the sale of investments of $205 million, primarily due to $433 million of gains on the sales of our investment in NII Holdings, Inc., partially offset by a loss of $274 million from the change in fair value of an option contract associated with our investment in NII Holdings, as described in note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We recognized a gain of $62 million from the sale of investments in 2005, which primarily consisted of gains related to our investments in Call Net Enterprises, Inc., NII Holdings and Earthlink, Inc. Other, net Other, net consists mainly of gain/loss on early retirement of debt and other miscellaneous income/expense. Income Tax Benefit (Expense) Our consolidated effective tax rates were 1.2% in 2007, 32.9% in 2006 and 36.4% in 2005. The 2007 effective tax rate was impacted by $29.3 billion of the $29.7 billion non cash impairment charge related to goodwill as substantially all of the charge is not separately deductible for tax purposes and a $105 million benefit related to state income tax law changes. Information regarding the items that caused the effective income tax rates to vary from the statutory federal rate for income taxes related to continuing operations can be found in note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 53 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations, net Discontinued operations reflect the results of our Local segment for 2005 and the year to date period through May 17, 2006, the date of the Embarq spin off. Additional information regarding our discontinued operations can be found in note 15 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net Income (Loss) We recorded a net loss in 2007 as compared to net income in 2006 principally due to a one time non cash goodwill impairment charge in our Wireless segment and a decline in the performance of the Wireless segment. Net income decreased in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily due to the discontinued operations of Embarq in 2006. We expect downward pressure on our consolidated results of operations in the near term caused principally by the expected decline in Wireless segment earnings discussed above, together with increased severance, exit costs. See Forward Looking Statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We consider the following accounting policies and estimates to be the most important to our financial position and results of operations, either because of the significance of the financial statement item or because they require the exercise of significant judgment and or use of significant estimates. While management believes that the estimates used are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Policies Operating revenues primarily consist of wireless service revenues, revenues generated from handset and accessory sales and revenues from wholesale operators and PCS Affiliates, as well as long distance voice, data and Internet revenues. Service revenues consist of fixed monthly recurring charges, variable usage charges such as roaming, directory assistance, and operator assisted calling and miscellaneous fees, such as activation, upgrade, late payment, reconnection and early termination fees and certain regulatory related fees. We recognize service revenues as services are rendered and equipment revenue when title passes to the dealer or end user customer, in accordance with SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin, or SAB, No. 104, Revenue Recognition, and Emerging Issues Task Force, or EITF, Issue No. 00 21, Revenue Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables. We recognize revenue for access charges and other services charged at fixed amounts ratably over the service period, net of credits and adjustments for service discounts, billing disputes and fraud or unauthorized usage. We recognize excess wireless usage and long distance revenue at contractual rates per minute as minutes are used. Additionally, we recognize excess wireless data usage based on kilobytes and one time use charges, such as for the use of premium services, when rendered. As a result of the cutoff times of our multiple billing cycles each month, we are required to estimate the amount of subscriber revenues earned but not billed from the end of each bill cycle to the end of each reporting period. These estimates are based primarily on rate plans in effect and our historical usage and billing patterns. Subscriber revenue earned but not billed represented about 11.4% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2007. We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable sufficient to cover probable and reasonably estimable losses. Because of the number of accounts that we have, it is not practical to review the collectibility of each of those accounts individually when we determine the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts each period, although we do perform some account level analysis with respect to large wireless and wireline customers. Our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts considers a number of factors, including collection experience, aging of the accounts receivable portfolios, the credit quality of our subscriber base, estimated proceeds from future bad debt sales, and other qualitative considerations, including macro economic factors. The accounting estimates related to the recognition of revenue in the results of operations require us to make assumptions about future billing adjustments for disputes with customers, unauthorized usage, and future returns and mail in rebates on handset sales. The allowance amounts recorded represent our best estimate of 54 Table of Contents future outcomes; to the extent that our actual experience differs significantly from historical trends, the required allowance amounts could differ from our estimate. Any resulting adjustments would change the net accounts receivable reported on our balance sheet, and bad debt expense, in the case of estimates related to doubtful accounts, or revenue, in the case of estimates related to other allowances, reported in our results of operations in future periods. For example, if our allowance for doubtful accounts estimate were to change by 10%, it would result in a corresponding change in bad debt expense of $37 million for the Wireless segment and $2 million for the Wireline segment. Device and Accessory Inventory Inventories of handsets and accessories in the Wireless segment are stated at the lower of cost or market. We determine cost by the first in, first out, or FIFO, method. Handset costs and related revenues are recognized at the time of sale. We do not recognize the expected handset subsidies prior to the time of sale because the promotional discount decision is made at the point of sale, and we expect to recover the handset subsidies through service revenues. As of December 31, 2007, we held $938 million of inventory. We analyze the realizable value of our handset and other inventory on a quarterly basis. This analysis includes assessing obsolescence, sales forecasts, product life cycle and marketplace and other considerations. If our assessments regarding the above factors change, we may be required to sell handsets at a higher subsidy or potentially record expense in future periods prior to the point of sale to the extent that we expect that we will be unable to sell handsets or use them in the service and repair channel. Valuation and Recoverability of Certain Long lived Assets Including Definite Lived Intangible Assets A significant portion of our total assets are long lived assets, including property, plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets. Changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets, as well as changes in economic or industry factors or in our business or prospects, may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change. Property, plant and equipment represented $26.5 billion of our $64.1 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2007. We generally calculate depreciation on these assets using the straight line method based on estimated economic useful lives as follows: Long lived Assets Estimated Useful Life Average Useful Life Buildings and improvements 3 to 30 years 12 years Network equipment, site costs and software 3 to 31 years 8 years Non network internal use software, office equipment and other 3 to 12 years 4 years We calculate depreciation on certain of our assets using the group life method. Accordingly, ordinary asset retirements and disposals are charged against accumulated depreciation with no gain or loss recognized. Since changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets, as well as changes in broad economic or industry factors, may cause the estimated period of use of these assets to change, we perform annual internal studies to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history, and assumptions about technology evolution, to calculate the remaining life of our asset base. When these factors indicate that an assets useful life is different from the original assessment, we depreciate the remaining book values prospectively over the adjusted estimated useful life. During the first quarter 2007, we implemented depreciation rate changes with respect to assets that comprise the CDMA and Wireline networks resulting from our annual depreciable lives study. These revised rates reflected both changes in the useful life estimates of certain of our asset groups and adjustments to our 55 Table of Contents accumulated depreciation accounts. The reduced expense associated with the depreciation rate changes resulted in approximately $400 million reduction in depreciation expense or $0.09 per share reduction in net loss for the year ended December 31, 2007. In addition to performing our annual study, we also continue to assess the estimated useful life of the iDEN network assets, which had a net carrying value of $7.9 billion as of December 31, 2007, and our future strategic plans for this network, as an increasingly larger portion of our subscriber base is served by our CDMA network. A reduction in our estimate of the useful life of the iDEN network assets would cause increased depreciation charges in future periods that could be material. For example, a 10% reduction in the remaining weighted average useful life of the iDEN network assets would increase annual depreciation expense by about $170 million. In conjunction with our fourth quarter goodwill impairment review, we re assessed the remaining useful lives of our long lived assets and concluded they were appropriate. We are in the process of completing our annual depreciation study and expect any results from that study to be concluded and initially recorded in the first quarter 2008. Intangible assets with definite useful lives represented $6.0 billion of our $64.1 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2007. Definite lived intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships that are amortized over two to five years using the sum of the years digits method, which we believe best reflects the estimated pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed. Other definite lived intangible assets primarily include certain rights under affiliation agreements that we reacquired in connection with the acquisitions of certain PCS Affiliates and Nextel Partners, which are being amortized over the remaining terms of those affiliation agreements on a straight line basis, and the Nextel and Direct Connect&reg; trade names, which are being amortized over ten years from the date of the Sprint Nextel merger on a straight line basis. We also evaluate the remaining useful lives of our definite lived intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization, which would be addressed prospectively. For example, we review certain trends such as customer churn, average revenue per user, revenue, our future plans regarding the iDEN network and changes in marketing strategies, among others. Significant changes in certain trends may cause us to adjust, on a prospective basis, the remaining estimated life of certain of our definite lived intangible assets. For additional information, please refer to note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. We review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We group our long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. Our asset groups consist of wireless and wireline, and the wireless asset group includes our intangible assets, our wireless property, plant and equipment and goodwill. Indicators of impairment for our asset groups include, but are not limited to, a sustained significant decrease in the market price of or the cash flows expected to be derived from the asset groups, or a significant change in the extent or manner in which the assets in the group are utilized. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining the occurrence of an indicator of impairment that requires an evaluation of the recoverability of our long lived assets. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of our assets, a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the assets. Impairment analyses, when performed, are based on our current business and technology strategy, our views of growth rates for our business, anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability. In conjunction with our annual assessment of goodwill for impairment, we performed a recoverability test of the wireless long lived assets in accordance with SFAS No. 144, Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long Lived Assets. We included cash flow projections from our wireless operations along with cash flows associated with the eventual disposition of the long lived assets, which included estimated proceeds from the sale of FCC licenses, trade names, and customer relationships. The undiscounted future cash flows of the wireless long lived assets exceeded their net book value. As a result, no impairment charge was recorded. In addition to the analyses described above, we periodically assess certain assets that have not yet been deployed in our business, including network equipment, cell site development costs, and software in development, to determine if an impairment charge is required. Network equipment and cell site development 56 Table of Contents costs are impaired whenever events or changes in circumstances cause us to abandon such assets if they are no longer needed to meet managements strategic network plans. Software development costs are impaired when it is no longer probable that the software project will be deployed. For the year ended December 31, 2007, we recorded an after tax impairment charge of $103 million primarily related to the abandonment of certain iDEN cell sites under construction. For the year ended December 31, 2006, we recorded an after tax impairment charge of $43 million primarily related to software asset impairments and abandonments of various assets, including certain cell sites under construction. For the year ended December 31, 2005, we recorded an after tax impairment charge of $27 million primarily related to the write off of various software applications. We also periodically assess network equipment that has been removed from the network to determine if an impairment charge is required. If we continue to have challenges retaining iDEN subscribers and as we continue to assess the impact of rebanding the iDEN network, management may abandon certain iDEN assets in future periods if we conclude those assets will either never be deployed or redeployed, in which case we would recognize a non cash impairment charge that could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Valuation and Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives represented $22.1 billion of our $64.1 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2007. We have identified FCC licenses and our Sprint and Boost Mobile trademarks as indefinite lived intangible assets, in addition to our goodwill, after considering the expected use of the assets, the regulatory and economic environment within which they are being used, and the effects of obsolescence on their use. We review our goodwill, which relates solely to our wireless reporting unit, and other indefinite lived intangibles annually in the fourth quarter for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We continually assess whether any indicators of impairment exist, which requires a significant amount of judgment. Such indicators may include, a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization; a decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and or slower growth rates, among others. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. When required, we first test goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of our wireless reporting unit with its net book value. If the fair value of the wireless reporting unit exceeds its net book value, goodwill is not deemed to be impaired, and no further testing would be necessary. If the net book value of our wireless reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform a second test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. To measure the amount of any impairment loss, we determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if our wireless reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. Specifically, we allocate the fair value of the wireless reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill, we record an impairment charge for the difference. During the period from our annual 2006 goodwill impairment assessment through the third quarter 2007, we periodically analyzed whether any indicators of impairment had occurred. As part of these periodic analyses, we derived the estimated equity value of the wireless reporting unit, which we then compared to its net book value. Specifically, we reduced our stock price by the estimated value per share of our Wireline reporting unit and then added a control premium, as permitted by FASB guidance, to determine an estimate of the equity value of the wireless reporting unit. As the estimated fair value of the wireless reporting unit was higher than its net book value during each of these periods, no additional testing was necessary. In the fourth quarter 2007, we conducted our annual assessment of goodwill for impairment. During this quarter, we experienced a sustained, significant decline in our stock price. The reduced market capitalization reflected the Wireless segments lower than expected performance, due in large part to fewer than expected net 57 Table of Contents subscriber additions. In previous periods, we had expected that we would be able to produce net post paid subscriber additions during 2007. In the fourth quarter, we reported a loss of 683,000 post paid subscribers which was the most post paid subscribers we had ever lost in a quarter. We also updated our forecasted cash flows of the wireless reporting unit during the fourth quarter. This update considered current economic conditions and trends; estimated future operating results; our views of growth rates, anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions; and the availability of necessary technology, network infrastructure, handsets and other devices. Several factors led to a reduction in forecasted cash flows, including, among others, our ability to attract and retain subscribers, particularly subscribers of our iDEN based services, in a highly competitive environment; expected reductions in voice revenue per subscriber; the costs of acquiring subscribers; and the costs of operating our wireless networks. Based on the results of our annual assessment of goodwill for impairment, the net book value of the wireless reporting unit exceeded its fair value. Therefore, we performed the second step of the impairment test to determine the implied fair value of goodwill. Specifically, we hypothetically allocated the fair value of the wireless reporting unit as determined in the first step to our recognized and unrecognized net assets, including allocations to intangible assets such as customer relationships, FCC licenses and trade names. Such items had fair values substantially in excess of current book values. The resulting implied goodwill was $935 million; accordingly, we reduced the goodwill recorded prior to this assessment by $29.7 billion to write our goodwill down to the implied goodwill amount as of December 31, 2007. The $29.7 billion goodwill impairment charge is our best estimate of the goodwill charge as of December 31, 2007. Any adjustment to that estimated charge resulting from the completion of the measurement of the impairment loss will be recognized in the first quarter 2008. The allocation discussed above is performed only for purposes of assessing goodwill for impairment; accordingly, we do not adjust the net book value of the assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet other than goodwill as a result of this process. We performed extensive valuation analyses, utilizing both income and market approaches, in our goodwill assessment process. The following describes the valuation methodologies used to derive the fair value of the wireless reporting unit. Income Approach: To determine fair value, we discounted the expected cash flows of the wireless reporting unit. The discount rate used represents the estimated weighted average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk involved in our wireless operations and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. To estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our model, we used a terminal value approach. Under this approach, we used estimated operating income before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization in the final year of our model, adjusted it to estimate a normalized cash flow, applied a perpetuity growth assumption and discounted by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value. We incorporated the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value. Market Based Approach: To corroborate the results of the income approach described above, we estimated the fair value of our wireless reporting unit using several market based approaches, including the value that we derive based on our consolidated stock price as described above. We also used the guideline company method, which focuses on comparing our risk profile and growth prospects to select reasonably similar/guideline publicly traded companies. The determination of fair value of the wireless reporting unit and other assets and liabilities within the wireless reporting unit requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating income before depreciation and amortization, or OIBDA and capital expenditures forecasts. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. We evaluated the merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair value of the wireless reporting unit, as well as the fair values of the corresponding assets and liabilities within the wireless reporting unit, and concluded they are reasonable. 58 Table of Contents Changes in certain assumptions could have a significant impact on the goodwill impairment charge. For example, a decrease in OIBDA by 5% or an increase in capital expenditures by 5% would result in an additional goodwill impairment charge equal to our remaining goodwill of $935 million. Conversely, an increase in OIBDA by 5% or a decrease in capital expenditures by 5% would result in a reduction to the goodwill impairment charge by $2.9 billion and $2.0 billion, respectively. A 50 basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate would result in an approximate $350 million increase or decrease to the goodwill or impairment charge, respectively. A 50 basis point increase or decrease in the terminal growth rate would result in an approximate $400 million decrease or increase to the charge, respectively. The sensitivity amounts above are calculated based on the impact of the change in the fair value of the wireless reporting unit, as well as the impact of changes in the fair values of the assets and liabilities of the wireless reporting unit. The allocation of the fair value of the wireless reporting unit to individual assets and liabilities within the wireless reporting unit also requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. The allocation requires several analyses to determine fair value of assets and liabilities including, among others, customer relationships, FCC licenses, trademarks and current replacement costs for certain property, plant and equipment. When required, we test other indefinite lived intangibles for impairment by comparing the assets respective carrying value to estimates of fair value, determined using the direct value method. Our FCC licenses are combined as a single unit of accounting following the unit of accounting guidance as prescribed by EITF Issue No. 02 7, Unit of Accounting for Testing Impairment of Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets, except for our FCC licenses in the 2.5 GHz band, which are tested separately as a single unit of accounting. The accounting estimates related to our indefinite lived intangible assets require us to make significant assumptions about fair values. Our assumptions regarding fair values require significant judgment about economic factors, industry factors and technology considerations, as well as our views regarding the prospects of our business. Changes in these judgments may have a significant effect on the estimated fair values. Tax Valuation Allowances and Uncertain Tax Positions We are required to estimate the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. This process requires management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact. We record valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if we determine it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. The accounting estimates related to the tax valuation allowance require us to make assumptions regarding the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. These assumptions require significant judgment because actual performance has fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future. The impact that changes in actual performance versus these estimates could have on the realization of tax benefits as reported in our results of operations could be material. We carried an income tax valuation allowance of $723 million as of December 31, 2007. This amount includes a valuation allowance of $477 million for the total tax benefits related to net operating loss carryforwards, subject to utilization restrictions, acquired in connection with certain acquisitions. The remainder of the valuation allowance relates to capital loss, state net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Within our total valuation allowance, we had $100 million related to separate company state net operating losses incurred by our subsidiaries after we acquired them. The valuation allowance was provided on these separate company state net operating loss benefits since these subsidiaries do not have a sufficient history of taxable income. Current analyses of cumulative historical income and qualitative factors indicate that the valuation allowance continues to be appropriate, meaning that we currently believe that it is more likely than not that we will not realize such tax benefits in the future. We will continue to monitor these analyses and factors in future periods and may adjust the valuation allowance based on the facts and circumstances existing in future periods. For the valuation allowance relating to the acquired tax benefits described above, if we reverse any allowance in 2008, we would first reduce 59 Table of Contents goodwill or intangible assets resulting from the acquisitions. Any adjustment to the valuation allowance after 2008 would be recorded to the statement of operations following the guidance in the recently issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations, described in further detail in Significant New Accounting Pronouncements. We adopted FASB Interpretation No. 48, or FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The accounting estimates related to the liability for uncertain tax positions require us to make judgments regarding the sustainability of each uncertain tax position based on its technical merits. If we determine it is more likely than not a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits, we record the impact of the position in our consolidated financial statements at the largest amount that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. These estimates are updated at each reporting date based on the facts, circumstances and information available. We are also required to assess at each reporting date whether it is reasonably possible that any significant increases or decreases to the unrecognized tax benefits will occur during the next twelve months. See note 7 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding FIN 48. Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $654 million as of December 31, 2007. Actual income taxes could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, our inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each years liability by taxing authorities. These changes could have a significant impact on our financial position. Significant New Accounting Pronouncements Fair Value Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements. This statement changes the definition of fair value, as defined by previous statements, to the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Additionally, this statement establishes a hierarchy that classifies the inputs used to measure fair value. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities. This statement allows entities the choice to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair value on specified measurement dates and report any unrecognized gains or losses in earnings and serves to minimize volatility in earnings that occurs when assets and liabilities are measured differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions. Both SFAS No. 157 and SFAS No. 159 are effective for our quarterly reporting period ending March 31, 2008, however in February 2008, the FASB issued a FASB Staff Position to partially delay the effective date of SFAS No. 157 for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities, except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis, until fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2008. Based on the FASB Staff Position noted above, the partial adoption of SFAS No. 157 will not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations in 2008. We are still assessing the impact that SFAS No. 157 will have on our nonrecurring measurements for nonfinancial assets and liabilities in 2009. Upon the partial adoption of SFAS No. 157 in the quarterly period ending March 31, 2008, we expect to have additional disclosures in the notes to our consolidated financial statements for certain recurring fair value measurements. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of the FASB Staff Position noted above as it relates to the disclosure of our nonrecurring fair value measurements, such as our annual impairment review of our goodwill and FCC licenses, and it will require significant disclosures related to our key assumptions and variables used in these analyses. We do not plan to elect the fair value option under the provisions of SFAS No. 159 for eligible financial assets and liabilities held on January 1, 2008; however, we will apply the fair value provisions of that statement for all eligible assets and liabilities subsequently acquired or modified on or after January 1, 2008. 60 Table of Contents Other New Accounting Pronouncements In September 2006, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 06 1, Accounting for Consideration Given by a Service Provider to a Manufacturer or Reseller of Equipment Necessary for an End Customer to Receive Service from the Service Provider. EITF Issue No. 06 1 provides guidance regarding whether the consideration given by a service provider to a manufacturer or reseller of specialized equipment should be characterized as a reduction of revenue or as an expense. This issue is effective for our quarterly reporting period ending March 31, 2008. Entities are required to recognize the effects of applying this issue as a change in accounting principle through retrospective application to all prior periods unless it is impracticable to do so. We do not expect this consensus to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In June 2007, the EITF reached a consensus on Issue No. 06 11, Accounting for Income Tax Benefits of Dividends on Share Based Payment Awards. EITF Issue No. 06 11 provides guidance regarding how an entity should recognize the tax benefit received as a result of dividends paid to holders of share based compensation awards and charged to retained earnings (accumulated deficit) according to SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment. This issue is effective for our quarterly reporting period ending March 31, 2008. We do not expect this consensus to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations, which revises SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, originally issued in June 2001. SFAS No. 141R will apply to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009, and this Statement could have a material impact on us with respect to business combinations completed after the effective date. Such significant changes include, but are not limited to the acquirer recording 100% of all assets and liabilities, including goodwill, of the acquired business, generally at their fair values, and acquisition related transaction and restructuring costs will be expensed rather than treated as part of the cost of the acquisition and included in the amount recorded for assets acquired. In addition, after the effective date, reversals of valuation allowances related to acquired deferred tax assets and changes to acquired income tax uncertainties related to any business combinations, even those completed prior to the Statements effective date, will be recognized in earnings, except for qualified measurement period adjustments. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. This statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 is effective for our quarterly reporting period ending March 31, 2009. This statement could have a material impact on us to the extent we enter into an arrangement after the effective date of the standard where we are required to consolidate a non controlling interest. If such an event occurred, we will report the non controlling interests equity as a component of our equity in our consolidated balance sheet, we will report the component of net income or loss and comprehensive income or loss attributable to the non controlling interest separately and changes in ownership interests will be treated as equity transactions. Upon a loss of control, any gain or loss on the interest sold will be recognized in earnings. Financial Condition Our consolidated assets were $64.1 billion as of December 31, 2007, which included $28.1 billion of intangible assets, and $97.2 billion as of December 31, 2006, which included $60.1 billion of intangible assets. The decrease in our consolidated assets was primarily a result of the $29.7 billion goodwill impairment charge, recorded in 2007, the amortization of $3.3 billion related to our definite lived intangible assets, cash used in our stock repurchase program and the settlement of our securities loan agreement. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information on the change in cash and cash equivalents. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management exercises discretion regarding the liquidity and capital resource needs of our business segments. This responsibility includes the ability to prioritize the use of capital and debt capacity, to determine cash management policies and to make decisions regarding the timing and amount of capital expenditures. 61 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations On May 17, 2006, we completed the spin off of Embarq. In connection with the spin off, Embarq transferred to our parent company $2.1 billion in cash and about $4.5 billion of Embarq senior notes in partial consideration for, and as a condition to, our transfer to Embarq of the local communications business. Embarq also retained about $665 million in debt obligations of its subsidiaries. The cash and senior notes were transferred by our parent company to our finance subsidiary, Sprint Capital Corporation, in satisfaction of indebtedness owed by our parent company to Sprint Capital. On May 19, 2006, Sprint Capital sold the Embarq senior notes to the public, and received about $4.4 billion in net proceeds. Embarq provided $903 million of net cash to us in 2006 excluding cash received from Embarq in connection with the spin off. Cash Flow Year Ended December 31, Change 2007 2006 2005 2007 Vs 2006 2006 Vs 2005 (in millions) Cash provided by operating activities $ 9,245 $ 10,958 $ 10,679 (16 )% 3 % Cash used in investing activities (6,377 ) (11,392 ) (4,724 ) (44 )% 141 % Cash used in financing activities (2,668 ) (6,423 ) (1,228 ) (58 )% NM At December 31, 2007, cash and cash equivalents were $2.2 billion as compared to $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2006. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $9.2 billion in 2007 decreased $1.7 billion from 2006 reflecting a decline in our earnings, primarily due to: a decrease in cash flows from discontinued operations of $903 million; a decrease in cash received from customers of $779 million primarily due to a decrease in service revenues as a result of increased customer churn; an increase in cash paid to our suppliers and employees of $285 million; and a decrease in interest received of $151 million due to a decrease in average commercial paper and temporary cash balances held during the year; offset by a decrease of $311 million in cash paid for interest on debt due to the retirement of debt and cash paid for taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities increased $279 million in 2006 from 2005 primarily due to a $12.0 billion increase in cash received from our customers as a result of the Sprint Nextel merger in the third quarter 2005, the PCS Affiliate acquisitions in 2005 and 2006 and the Nextel Partners acquisition in the second quarter 2006, as well as continued growth in the Wireless customer base. This increase was partially offset by an $8.5 billion increase in cash paid to suppliers and employees, $1.2 billion of proceeds received in 2005 from the communications towers lease transaction and a decrease in cash provided from discontinued operations of $1.1 billion. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities of $6.4 billion decreased $5.0 billion from 2006 primarily due to: a $10.2 billion decrease in cash paid for acquisitions in 2007 as compared to 2006 when we acquired Alamosa Holdings, UbiquiTel, Velocita Wireless, Enterprise Communications and Nextel Partners for $10.5 billion compared to $287 million that we paid for the acquisition of Northern PCS in 2007; 62 Table of Contents a $1.2 billion decrease in capital expenditures from 2006 due to fewer cell sites, capacity modifications and inventory reductions in our Wireless segment and decreased investment in transport and switching equipment related to voice and cable customers; and collateral of $866 million in cash received back from our securities loan agreements in 2007, compared to $866 million used to collaterize securities loan agreements in 2006; offset by a net decrease in proceeds from sale and maturities of marketable securities, investments and assets net of purchases, of $1.8 billion; and $6.3 billion in proceeds received in 2006 in connection with the spin off of our Local segment, including $1.8 billion received from Embarq at the time of the spin off and proceeds from the sale of Embarq notes of $4.4 billion. Net cash used in investing activities increased in 2006 by $6.7 billion from 2005 due primarily to: a $10.3 billion increase in cash paid for acquisitions; a $2.5 billion increase in cash paid for capital expenditures due to higher spending in our Wireless segment, in part related to spending on our iDEN network acquired in the Sprint Nextel merger; and $866 million in cash used to collateralize securities loan agreements; partially offset by $6.3 billion in proceeds received in 2006 in connection with the spin off of our Local segment, including $1.8 billion received from Embarq at the time it was spun off and proceeds from the sale of the Embarq notes of $4.4 billion. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities of $2.7 billion during 2007 decreased $3.8 billion compared to 2006, primarily due to: a decrease in cash used for debt and credit facility payments of $6.7 billion. In 2007, we made principal and debt repayments of $1.4 billion compared to payments in 2006 of $4.3 billion in payments and retirements related to our senior notes and capital lease obligations, $3.2 billion related to the retirement of our term loan and $500 million to retire the Nextel Partners credit facility; offset by $135 million in net maturities of commercial paper in 2007 compared to net issuances of $514 million in 2006; payment of $866 million in 2007 to settle collaterized borrowings compared to proceeds of $866 million received from securities loan agreements in 2006; and proceeds of $1.5 billion in 2007, including $750 million from our unsecured loan agreement with Export Development Canada and $750 million in principal from the sale of floating rate notes due 2010 compared to proceeds of $2.0 billion in principal amount of 6.0% senior serial redeemable notes received in 2006 that are due in 2016. Pursuant to our share repurchase program, we repurchased about 87 million of our common shares for $1.8 billion in 2007 compared to 98 million of our common shares repurchased in 2006 for $1.6 billion. We received $344 million in 2007 and $405 million in 2006 in proceeds from common share issuances, primarily resulting from exercises of employee options. We paid cash dividends of $286 million in 2007 compared to $296 million in 2006. During 2006, we used $247 million to retire our Seventh series redeemable preferred shares. 63 Table of Contents Net cash used in financing activities of $6.4 billion during 2006 increased $5.2 billion from 2005 primarily due to $1.6 billion for the purchase of our outstanding common shares pursuant to our share repurchase program that commenced in the third quarter 2006; $3.7 billion paid for the retirement of our term loan and Nextel Partners bank credit facility compared to 2005 when we retired a $2.2 billion term loan and a $1.0 billion revolving credit loan with a new $3.2 billion loan; $4.3 billion in payments and retirements related to our capital lease obligations and senior notes compared to $1.2 billion in 2005; partially offset by net proceeds from the sale of $2.0 billion in principal amount of 6.0% senior serial redeemable notes due in 2016; proceeds of $866 million from securities loan agreements; net proceeds of $514 million from issuance of commercial paper; and $405 million in proceeds from common share issuances in 2006 compared to $432 million in 2005. We paid cash dividends of $296 million in 2006 compared to $525 million in 2005. The decrease in cash dividends paid is due to a decrease in the dividend rate from $0.125 per common share per quarter in the first two quarters of 2005 to $0.025 per common share per quarter beginning in the third quarter 2005. This dividend rate decrease was partially offset by an increase in the average number of common shares outstanding in the year ended December 31, 2006 compared to the year ended December 31, 2005, primarily as a result of the Sprint Nextel merger. Capital Requirements We currently anticipate that future funding needs in the near term will principally relate to: operating expenses relating to our segment operations; capital expenditures, particularly with respect to the expansion of the coverage and capacity of our wireless networks and the deployment of new technologies in those networks, including our plans to build a next generation broadband wireless network; scheduled interest and principal payments related to our debt and any purchases or redemptions of our debt securities; amounts required to be expended in connection with the Report and Order; increasing expenditures for income taxes, after utilization of available tax net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards; potential costs of compliance with regulatory mandates; and other general corporate expenditures. Liquidity As of December 31, 2007, our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $2.4 billion. We have a $6.0 billion revolving credit facility, which expires in December 2010 and provides for interest rates equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, or prime rate plus a spread that varies depending on our parent companys credit ratings. There is no rating trigger that would allow the lenders to terminate this facility in the event of a credit rating downgrade. 64 Table of Contents In April 2006, we commenced a commercial paper program, which reduced our borrowing costs by allowing us to issue short term debt at lower rates than those available under our $6.0 billion revolving credit facility. The $2.0 billion program is backed by our revolving credit facility and reduces the amount we can borrow under the facility to the extent of the commercial paper outstanding. As of December 31, 2007, we had $379 million of commercial paper outstanding. As of December 31, 2007, we had $2.6 billion in letters of credit, including a $2.5 billion letter of credit required by the Report and Order, outstanding under our $6.0 billion revolving credit facility. These letters of credit reduce the availability under the revolving credit facility by an equivalent amount. As a result of the letters of credit and outstanding commercial paper, as of December 31, 2007, we had about $3.0 billion of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility. In light of conditions in our business and the financial markets, we have taken actions designed to enhance our financial flexibility. First, in early 2008, we decided that we will not pay dividends for the foreseeable future. Second, in late February 2008, we drew down $2.5 billion under our revolving credit facility to mitigate potential refinancing risk related to $1.25 billion in bonds that mature in November 2008 and our commercial paper program, as well as to enhance our financial flexibility in general. We now have about $500 million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving credit facility. Our credit facilities require that we maintain a ratio of total indebtedness to trailing four quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of no more than 3.5 to 1.0, and as of December 31, 2007, the ratio was 2.5 to 1.0. A default under our credit facilities could trigger defaults under our other debt obligations, which in turn could result in the maturities of certain debt obligations being accelerated. Our credit facilities and the indentures that govern our outstanding senior notes also require that we comply with various covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness and liens by us and our subsidiaries. Our credit facility covenants limit our subsidiaries (other than Nextel Communications and Sprint Capital Corp.) from incurring indebtedness or liens in excess of 15% of our consolidated shareholders equity. As of December 31, 2007, indebtedness from such subsidiaries totaled $0.5 billion. Accordingly, the fourth quarter 2007 charge related to the impairment of our goodwill has caused a reduction in the amount of debt and liens that can be incurred under our credit facilities by certain of our subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2007, we were in compliance with all covenants associated with our borrowings. Our ability to fund our capital needs from outside sources is ultimately impacted by the overall capacity and terms available from the banking and securities markets. Given the volatility in these markets, we continue to monitor them closely and to take steps to maintain financial flexibility and a reasonable cost of capital. On February 28, 2008, one debt rating agency downgraded our rating to below investment grade. Downgrades of our current short or long term ratings to below investment grade would not accelerate scheduled principal payments of our existing debt. The downgrade of our rating may cause us to incur higher interest costs on our borrowings and our access to the public capital markets could be negatively impacted. Our access to the commercial paper market may not be available on terms attractive to us, or at all. As of December 31, 2007, we had a working capital deficit of $443 million compared to working capital of $562 million as of December 31, 2006. 65 Table of Contents Future Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007. The information in the table reflects future unconditional payments and is based upon, among other things, the terms of the relevant agreements, appropriate classification of items under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, currently in effect and certain assumptions, such as future interest rates. Future events, including additional purchases of our securities and refinancing of those securities, could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts. See Forward Looking Statements. Future Contractual Obligations Total 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 andThereafter (in millions) Senior notes, bank credit facilities, debentures and commercial paper(1) $ 36,673 $ 3,175 $ 2,024 $ 2,730 $ 2,917 $ 4,312 $ 21,515 Capital leases(2) 174 29 17 12 12 12 92 Operating leases(3) 16,276 1,567 1,638 1,493 1,347 1,224 9,007 Purchase orders and other commitments(4) 15,388 7,957 2,436 1,381 886 602 2,126 Total $ 68,511 $ 12,728 $ 6,115 $ 5,616 $ 5,162 $ 6,150 $ 32,740 (1) Includes principal and estimated interest payments. Interest payments are based on managements expectations for future interest rates. (2) Represents capital lease payments including interest. (3) Includes future lease costs related to cell and switch sites, real estate, network equipment and office space. (4) Includes service, spectrum, network capacity and other executory contracts. Excludes blanket purchase orders in the amount of $2.4 billion. See below for further discussion. The table above does not include remaining costs to be paid in connection with the fulfillment of our obligation under the Report and Order. The total minimum cash obligation for the Report and Order is $2.8 billion. Costs incurred under the Report and Order associated with the reconfiguration of the 800 MHz band may be applied against the $2.8 billion obligation, subject to approval by the TA under the Report and Order. Because the final reconciliation and audit of the entire reconfiguration obligation outlined in the Report and Order will not take place until after the completion of all aspects of the reconfiguration process, there can be no assurance that we will be given full credit for the expenditures that we have incurred under the Report and Order. Additionally, since we, the TA and the FCC have not yet reached an agreement on the methodology for calculating certain amounts of property, plant and equipment to be submitted for credit associated with reconfiguration activity related to our own network, we cannot provide assurance that we will be granted full credit for certain of these network costs. However we believe that if we are successful in our appeal of the Third MO&O, we estimate, based on our experience to date with the reconfiguration program and on information currently available, that our total direct costs attributable to complete the spectrum reconfiguration will range between $2.7 billion and $3.4 billion. This estimate is dependent on significant assumptions including the final licensee costs, and costs associated with relocating licensees in the Canadian and Mexican border regions for which there are currently no approved border plans. In addition, depending on the outcome of our discussions with the TA regarding the calculation of the credit for our internal network costs, our total approved costs would increase. Actual results could differ from such estimates. In addition, we are entitled to receive reimbursement from the mobile satellite service licensees for their pro rata portion of our costs of clearing a portion of the 1.9 GHz spectrum. Those licensees may be unable or unwilling to reimburse us for their share of the costs, which we estimate to be approximately $200 million. If we are unsuccessful in our appeal of the Third MO&O, we anticipate that our costs could exceed $3.4 billion, by an amount that would likely be material. However, we believe that it is unlikely we will be required to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury. From the inception of the program and through December 31, 2007, we have incurred approximately $1.1 billion of costs directly attributable to the spectrum reconfiguration program. This amount does not include any of our apportioned 66 Table of Contents internal network costs that we have preliminarily allocated to the reconfiguration program for capacity sites and modifications for which we may request credit under the reconfiguration program. Purchase orders and other commitments include minimum purchases we commit to purchase from suppliers over time and or the unconditional purchase obligations where we guarantee to make a minimum payment to suppliers for goods and services regardless of whether suppliers fully deliver them. They include agreements for access and backhaul and customer billing services, advertising services and contracts related to information technology and customer care outsourcing arrangements. Amounts actually paid under some of these other agreements will likely be higher due to variable components of these agreements. The more significant variable components that determine the ultimate obligation owed include hours contracted, subscribers and other factors. In addition, we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and create an obligation to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the delivery of functioning software or products. Because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements, no such amounts have been included in the table above. The table above also excludes about $2.4 billion of blanket purchase order amounts since their agreement terms are not specified. No time frame is set for these purchase orders and they are not legally binding. As a result, they are not firm commitments. Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $654 million as of December 31, 2007. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the timing of the resolution of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular years in the table. Off Balance Sheet Financing We do not participate in, or secure, financings for any unconsolidated, special purpose entities. Future Outlook We expect to be able to meet our currently identified funding needs for at least the next 12 months by using: our anticipated cash flows from operating activities as well as our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand; and or the $2.5 billion of cash that we drew down under our revolving credit facility on February 27, 2008, as well as any remaining cash available under the facility. In making this assessment, we have considered: anticipated levels of capital expenditures and FCC license acquisitions, including funding required in connection with the deployment of next generation technologies and our next generation broadband wireless network; anticipated payments under the Report and Order, as supplemented; scheduled debt service requirements; and other future contractual obligations. If there are material changes in our business plans, or currently prevailing or anticipated economic conditions in any of our markets or competitive practices in the mobile wireless communications industry, or if other presently unexpected circumstances arise that have a material effect on our cash flow or profitability, anticipated cash needs could change significantly. The conclusion that we expect to meet our funding needs for at least the next 12 months as described above does not take into account: any significant acquisition transactions or the pursuit of any significant new business opportunities or spectrum acquisition strategies; 67 Table of Contents potential material purchases or redemptions of our outstanding debt securities for cash; and potential material increases in the cost of compliance with regulatory mandates. Any of these events or circumstances could involve significant additional funding needs in excess of anticipated cash flows from operating activities and the identified currently available funding sources, including existing cash on hand and borrowings available under our existing revolving credit facility. If existing capital resources are not sufficient to meet these funding needs, it would be necessary to raise additional capital to meet those needs. Our ability to raise additional capital, if necessary, is subject to a variety of additional factors that cannot currently be predicted with certainty, including: the commercial success of our operations; the volatility and demand of the capital markets; the market prices of our securities; and tax law restrictions related to the spin off of Embarq that may limit our ability to raise capital from the sale of our equity securities. We have in the past and may in the future have discussions with third parties regarding potential sources of new capital to satisfy actual or anticipated financing needs. At present, other than the existing arrangements that have been described in this report, we have no legally binding commitments or understandings with any third parties to obtain any material amount of additional capital. The above discussion is subject to the risks and other cautionary and qualifying factors set forth under Forward Looking Statements and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in this report. Financial Strategies General Risk Management Policies We primarily use derivative instruments for hedging and risk management purposes. Hedging activities may be done for various purposes, including, but not limited to, mitigating the risks associated with an asset, liability, committed transaction or probable forecasted transaction. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through stringent credit approval and review processes, credit support agreements, continual review and monitoring of all counterparties, and thorough legal review of contracts. We also control exposure to market risk by regularly monitoring changes in hedge positions under normal and stress conditions to ensure they do not exceed established limits. Our board of directors has adopted a financial risk management policy that authorizes us to enter into derivative transactions, and all transactions comply with the policy. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes with the exception of equity rights obtained in connection with commercial agreements or strategic investments, usually in the form of warrants to purchase common shares. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are primarily exposed to the market risk associated with unfavorable movements in interest rates, foreign currencies, and equity prices. The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors. Interest Rate Risk The communications industry is a capital intensive, technology driven business. We are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our borrowings. Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows. Specific interest rate risk include: the risk of increasing interest rates on short term debt; the risk of increasing interest rates for planned new fixed rate long term financings; and the risk of increasing interest rates for planned refinancings using long term fixed rate debt. 68 Table of Contents Cash Flow Hedges We enter into interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges to reduce the impact of interest rate movements on future interest expense by effectively converting a portion of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate. As of December 31, 2007, we had no outstanding interest rate cash flow hedges. Fair Value Hedges We enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate movements and achieve an optimal mixture of floating and fixed rate debt while minimizing liquidity risk. The interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively convert our fixed rate debt to a floating rate by receiving fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the agreement without an exchange of the underlying principal amount. As of December 31, 2007, we had outstanding interest rate swap agreements that were designated as fair value hedges. About 86% of our debt as of December 31, 2007 was fixed rate debt excluding interest rate swaps. While changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt, there is no impact to earnings and cash flows because we intend to hold these obligations to maturity unless market and other conditions are favorable. As of December 31, 2007, we held fair value interest rate swaps with a notional value of $1 billion. These swaps were entered into as hedges of the fair value of a portion of our senior notes. These interest rate swaps have maturities ranging from 2008 to 2012. On a semiannual basis, we pay a floating rate of interest equal to the six month LIBOR plus a fixed spread and receive an average interest rate equal to the coupon rates stated on the underlying senior notes. On December 31, 2007, the rate we would pay averaged 8.0% and the rate we would receive was 7.2%. Assuming a one percentage point increase in the prevailing forward yield curve, the fair value of the interest rate swaps and the underlying senior notes would change by $21 million. These interest rate swaps met all the requirements for perfect effectiveness under derivative accounting rules as all of the critical terms of the swaps perfectly matched the corresponding terms of the hedged debt; therefore, there is no net effect to earnings and cash flows for any fair value fluctuations. We perform interest rate sensitivity analyses on our variable rate debt including interest rate swaps. These analyses indicate that a one percentage point change in interest rates would have an annual pre tax impact of $39 million on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows as of December 31, 2007. While our variable rate debt may impact earnings and cash flows as interest rates change, it is not subject to changes in fair values. We also perform a sensitivity analysis on the fair market value of our outstanding debt. A 10% decline in market interest rates would cause a $900 million increase in the fair market value of our debt to $22.9 billion. This analysis includes the hedged debt. Foreign Currency Risk We also enter into forward contracts and options in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Our foreign exchange risk management program focuses on reducing transaction exposure to optimize consolidated cash flow. We use foreign currency derivatives to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to settlement of international telecommunications access charges and the operation of our international subsidiaries. The dollar equivalent of our net foreign currency payables from international settlements was $16 million and the net foreign currency receivables from international operations was $12 million as of December 31, 2007. The potential immediate pre tax loss to us that would result from a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates based on these positions would be insignificant. 69 Table of Contents Equity Risk We are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments. We invest in equity instruments of public and private companies for operational and strategic business purposes. These securities are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to volatility of the stock market and industries in which the companies operate. These securities, which are classified in investments and marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheets, include equity method investments, investments in private securities, available for sale securities and equity derivative instruments. Additional information regarding our derivative instruments can be found in note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In certain business transactions, we are granted warrants to purchase the securities of other companies at fixed rates. These warrants are supplemental to the terms of the business transaction and are not designated as hedging instruments.
