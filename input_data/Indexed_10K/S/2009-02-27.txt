Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations Forward Looking Statements We include certain estimates, projections and other forward looking statements in our annual, quarterly and current reports, and in other publicly available material. Statements regarding expectations, including performance assumptions and estimates relating to capital requirements, as well as other statements that are not historical facts, are forward looking statements. These statements reflect managements judgments based on currently available information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements. With respect to these forward looking statements, management has made assumptions regarding, among other things, customer and network usage, customer growth and retention, pricing, operating costs, the timing of various events and the economic and regulatory environment. Future performance cannot be assured. Actual results may differ materially from those in the forward looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include: our ability to attract and retain subscribers; the effects of vigorous competition on a highly penetrated market, including the impact of competition on the price we are able to charge subscribers for services and equipment we provide and our ability to attract new subscribers and retain existing subscribers; the overall demand for our service offerings, including the impact of decisions of new subscribers between our post paid and prepaid services offerings and between our two network platforms; and the impact of new, emerging and competing technologies on our business; the effect of limiting capital and operating expenditures on our ability to improve and enhance our networks and service offerings, implement our business strategies and provide competitive new technologies; volatility in the trading price of our common stock, current economic conditions and our ability to access capital; the impact of third parties not meeting our business requirements, including a significant adverse change in the ability or willingness of such parties to provide handset devices or infrastructure equipment for our CDMA network, or Motorola, Inc.s ability or willingness to provide related handset devices, infrastructure equipment and software applications, or to develop new technologies or features, for our iDEN network; the costs and business risks associated with providing new services and entering new geographic markets; 31 Table of Contents the financial performance of Clearwire and its deployment of a WiMAX network; the effects of mergers and consolidations and new entrants in the communications industry and unexpected announcements or developments from others in the communications industry; unexpected results of litigation filed against us or our suppliers or vendors; the impact of adverse network performance; the costs and or potential customer impacts of compliance with regulatory mandates; equipment failure, natural disasters, terrorist acts or other breaches of network or information technology security; one or more of the markets in which we compete being impacted by changes in political, economic or other factors such as monetary policy, legal and regulatory changes or other external factors over which we have no control; and other risks referenced from time to time in this report, including in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors and other filings of ours with the SEC. The words may, could, estimate, project, forecast, intend, expect, believe, target, plan, providing guidance and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are found throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and elsewhere in this report. The reader should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We are not obligated to publicly release any revisions to forward looking statements to reflect events after the date of this report, including unforeseen events. Overview We are a communications company offering a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications products and services that are designed to meet the needs of individual consumers, businesses and government subscribers. The communications industry has been and will continue to be highly competitive on the basis of price, the types of services and devices offered and the quality of service. We have accordingly organized our operations to meet the needs of our targeted customer groups through focused communications solutions that incorporate the capabilities of our wireless and wireline services. We are one of the three largest wireless companies in the United States based on the number of wireless subscribers. We also are one of the largest providers of wireline long distance services and one of the largest carriers of Internet traffic in the nation. We own extensive wireless networks and a global long distance, Tier 1 Internet backbone. Our business includes two reportable segments: Wireless and Wireline. See the information discussed in Item 1 and in note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our segments. In addition, we also routinely post important information on our website at www.sprint.com. Information contained on our website is not part of this annual report. We offer wireless services and wireline voice and data transmission services on state of the art networks that utilize CDMA, iDEN and IP technologies. We utilize these networks to offer our wireless and wireline customers differentiated products and services whether through the use of a single network or a combination of these networks. In addition, we have established key priorities for our Wireless business which include improving the customer experience, rebuilding our brand and increasing profitability. We plan to achieve these priorities by providing customers with value and simplicity and by helping them to be more productive. We believe that our value driven price plans are very attractive. Our family of Simply Everything post paid price plans bundle together popular data applications with traditional mobile voice calling at price points that can save customers hundreds of dollars annually compared with our largest competitors. Our Boost Mobile brand prepaid price plans include unique nationwide monthly unlimited, pay as you go, and $1 per day chat plan options. 32 Table of Contents To simplify the customer experience, we have introduced tools such as One Click that allows customers to access various software applications through a single click on their mobile devices. Our Ready Now program trains our subscribers before they leave the store in how to use their mobile devices to ensure subscribers are well informed and comfortable with the features and functions of their new devices. We provide certain wireless services on the nations most dependable 3G network and, in Baltimore, subscribers may access Clearwires high speed 4G network. In addition, we support the open development of applications and content on our network platforms. We offer multi functional devices such as the Samsung Instinct and the iDEN Blackberry Curve. Through wholesale relationships, we support traditional wireless services as well as the wireless delivery of books and other data centric content that substitute for more traditional deliveries of products and services. In addition to our customer oriented goals, we have also taken measures to reduce our cost structure to further align with the reduced revenues expected from fewer subscribers. Our actions include our January 2009 workforce reduction announcement through which we plan to reduce our labor and related costs by approximately $1.2 billion through actions that include a workforce reduction of about 8,000 positions. We believe these actions, as well as our continued efforts to reduce our other operating expenses, will allow us to maintain a strong cash position, although we do not expect that these measures will offset the reduced cash expected from our service revenue declines in the near term. Our cost reduction initiatives may also include de levering and disposing of assets in the future. We believe that given the recent deterioration in the U.S. economy coupled with short term illiquidity, consumer and business spending will be negatively impacted. We will continue to monitor the impact of these market conditions on our ability to collect from our subscribers and on other areas of our business. We are subject to substantial regulation including from the FCC, which regulates the licensing, operation, acquisition and sale of the licensed radio spectrum that is essential to our business. The FCC and state public utility commissions, or PUCs, also regulate, in whole or part, the provision of communications services. Future changes in regulations or legislation related to spectrum licensing or other matters related to our business could impose significant additional costs either in the form of direct out of pocket costs or additional compliance obligations. Refer to Item 1. Business Legislative and Regulatory Development Regulation and Wireless Operations for additional information. Wireless Service Revenue Our Wireless segment generates revenues from the provision of wireless services, the sale of wireless equipment and the provision of wholesale and other services. The ability of our Wireless segment to generate service revenues is primarily a function of: the number of subscribers that we serve, which in turn is a function of our ability to acquire new and retain existing subscribers; and the revenue generated from each subscriber, which in turn is a function of the types and amount of services utilized by each subscriber and the rates that we charge for those services. The declines in our subscriber base and revenue generated from each subscriber group discussed below have resulted in a decline in service revenue. Wireless Subscribers The wireless industry is subject to intense competition to acquire and retain subscribers of wireless services. Most markets in which we operate have high rates of penetration for wireless services. Wireless carriers accordingly must attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from competitors rather than from first time subscribers. As a result, wireless carriers have focused on retaining valued subscribers through various means including considerable efforts regarding customer care. 33 Table of Contents We have endeavored to retain and attract subscribers by taking actions to improve our customer care, sales and distribution functions, and brand awareness. In addition, we took other actions in an effort to improve our subscribers experience including improving our network performance by adding cell sites to expand the coverage and capacity of our networks, broadening our handset portfolio, and providing subscribers an excellent value proposition with our Simply Everything pricing plans. While certain indicators suggest that we are making progress with respect to these actions, we have continued to lose wireless subscribers. Post Paid Subscribers We lost approximately 4.1 million net post paid subscribers during 2008 as compared to losing 1.2 million net post paid subscribers in 2007. In 2008, after considering subscribers transferring from our iDEN network to our CDMA network, approximately 3.6 million of our net post paid subscriber losses came from subscribers on the iDEN network as compared to 435,000 net subscriber losses on the CDMA network. In 2007, approximately 4.4 million of our net post paid subscriber losses came from subscribers on our iDEN network as compared to 3.1 million net post paid subscriber additions on the CDMA network. Our net subscriber losses have principally been caused by our attracting fewer new subscribers on both networks in recent periods as compared to the number of subscriber deactivations we have experienced. We believe this reduction in new subscribers is primarily due to the market penetration rates described above compounded by the relative success that certain of our competitors are enjoying with respect to retaining subscribers. We further believe this reduction in new subscribers is due to measures taken by us to increase the credit quality of our subscribers, as well as lingering consumer perceptions regarding our networks, particularly our iDEN network, and customer care. Our reduced iDEN oriented marketing programs and limited new handset offerings at higher than market prices have also contributed to the decline in new iDEN subscribers. Our post paid subscriber retention rates (or rates of customer churn) remain high relative to our larger competitors; however, our post paid subscriber churn rates have remained relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007 and 2006, as we have experienced improvement in involuntary deactivations, due to our improving the credit quality of our subscriber base, offset by relatively high voluntary subscriber deactivations. Prepaid Subscribers We lost approximately 981,000 net prepaid subscribers during 2008 as compared to adding 566,000 net prepaid subscribers in 2007. The 2008 subscriber losses included approximately 1.4 million net subscribers on our iDEN network which was partially offset by 381,000 net subscriber additions on our CDMA network. In 2007, we had 83,000 and 483,000 net prepaid subscriber additions on our iDEN and CDMA networks, respectively. Our net prepaid subscriber losses in 2008 were principally caused by our attracting fewer new subscribers on the iDEN network and total deactivations increasing year over year. We believe the net losses sustained are primarily due to our decision to focus our resources on our post paid business and increased competition from prepaid competitors. Refer to Results of Operations Segment Results of Operations Wireless Wireless Segment Earnings below for a discussion of churn trends. Wholesale and Affiliate Subscribers Wholesale and affiliate subscribers represent customers that we serve on our networks through companies that resell our services to their subscribers. In 2008, wholesale subscriber additions were 389,000, resulting in about 8.1 million wholesale subscribers at December 31, 2008, compared to about 7.7 million wholesale subscribers at December 31, 2007 and 6.4 million wholesale subscribers at December 31, 2006. Certain wholesale devices are activated on the network by our wholesale partners prior to selling the device to the end user customer. As of December 31, 2008, these subscribers, for which devices are not in the hands of an end user customer, represented approximately 2% of the total wholesale subscriber base. 34 Table of Contents Below is a table showing (a) net additions (losses) for the past twelve quarters of direct subscribers for our iDEN and CDMA networks, excluding subscribers obtained through business combinations, existing subscribers who have migrated between networks and indirect subscribers of MVNOs and PCS Affiliates, (b) our total iDEN and CDMA post paid subscribers as of each of the quarters in 2006, 2007 and 2008, and (c) our average rates of monthly post paid and prepaid customer churn for the past twelve quarters.

To effect this change, the subscriber base as of October 1, 2006 was increased by 436,000 subscribers. We adjusted our subscriber beginning balance so as to not increase our direct net subscriber additions or decrease the customer churn rates for the fourth quarter 2006 due to this policy change. (2) Includes subscribers with PowerSource devices, which operate seamlessly between our CDMA and iDEN networks, introduced in the fourth quarter 2006. (3) We calculate churn by dividing net subscriber deactivations for the quarter by the sum of the average number of subscribers for each month in the quarter. For accounts comprised of multiple subscribers, such as family plans and enterprise accounts, net deactivations are defined as deactivations in excess of customer activations in a particular account within 30 days. Post paid churn consists of both voluntary churn, where the subscriber makes his or her own determination to cease being a customer, and involuntary churn, where we terminate the customers service due to a lack of payment or other reasons. (4) During the third quarter 2007, we implemented an additional churn rule to remove the impact of activations and deactivations occurring within 30 days in the same account. The new rule, which we believe presents a more precise churn calculation, reduced churn by 10 basis points to 2.3% in the third quarter 2007. The additional churn rule did not impact reported net additions or results of operations. Prior period churn figures have not been adjusted for this additional churn rule. 35 Table of Contents Wireless Subscriber Expectations We are committed to both adding new subscribers and retaining existing subscribers in order to reverse the negative subscriber trends that we have experienced in recent years. We expect to improve our subscriber results by consistently improving the customer experience by focusing on value, simplicity and productivity. We expect that both post paid and total subscriber losses will improve in 2009 as compared to 2008. We believe this improvement will principally be driven by strengthening our brand through improving the customer experience as well as by the launch of our monthly prepaid nationwide unlimited plan on our iDEN network. Our net subscriber losses during the past two years have significantly reduced our revenue, operating margin and cash flow. These effects will continue if we do not attract new subscribers and or reduce our rate of churn. See Forward Looking Statements and Results of Operations Segment Results of Operations Wireless Wireless Segment Earnings below for a discussion of how our subscriber trends will impact our segment earnings trends. Average Revenue per Subscriber Below is a table showing our average revenue per post paid and prepaid subscriber for the past twelve quarters. Quarter Ended March 31,2006 June 30,2006 September 30,2006 December 31,2006 March 31,2007 June 30,2007 September 30,2007 December 31,2007 March 31,2008 June 30,2008 September 30,2008 December 31,2008 Average monthly service revenue per subscriber (1) Direct post paid $ 62 $ 62 $ 61 $ 60 $ 59 $ 60 $ 59 $ 58 $ 56 $ 56 $ 56 $ 56 Direct prepaid $ 36 $ 34 $ 33 $ 32 $ 32 $ 31 $ 30 $ 28 $ 29 $ 30 $ 31 $ 30 (1) Average monthly service revenue per subscriber for the quarter is calculated by dividing our quarterly service revenue by the sum of our average number of subscribers for each month in the quarter. Changes in average monthly post paid service revenue reflect subscribers who change rate plans, the level of voice and data usage during a quarter, the amount of service credits which we offer our subscribers, plus the net effect of average monthly revenue generated by new subscribers and deactivating subscribers. Average monthly post paid service revenue per subscriber was flat throughout 2008 as we improved the retention of our higher revenue subscribers and lessened the impact of rate plan migrations. These improvements have been offset by the decline in average monthly post paid service revenue per iDEN subscriber. Our retention efforts have been focused on improving the customer experience, including, but not limited to, new Simply Everything bundled plans that provide unlimited voice, data, text and Direct Connect services; improved service levels from our customer care centers; and the new Ready Now program. The decline in average monthly post paid service revenue per subscriber from 2007 and 2006 is primarily due to the loss of iDEN subscribers with higher priced service plans and the migration of iDEN subscribers to lower priced plans. Our average monthly service revenue in these periods also declined due to other reasons, the most significant of which is the number of service credits accepted by our subscribers on both networks, which increased due to our retention efforts. Average monthly prepaid service revenue per subscriber increased during the first, second and third quarters of 2008 due to higher access charges received from our Boost Unlimited users combined with more stable average revenue per subscriber from our traditional prepaid users. Average monthly prepaid service revenue per subscriber declined in the fourth quarter 2008 due to a decline in average revenue per subscriber from our traditional prepaid users. There is no assurance that average monthly service revenue per post paid and prepaid subscribers will continue at these rates in the future. Segment Earnings Wireless segment earnings is primarily a function of wireless service revenue, costs to acquire subscribers, network and interconnection costs to serve those subscribers and other Wireless segment operating expenses. The costs to acquire our subscribers include the net cost at which we sell our handsets, referred to as handset subsidies, as well as the marketing and sales costs incurred to attract those subscribers. Network costs primarily 36 Table of Contents represent switch and cell site costs and interconnection costs generally consist of per minute usage fees and roaming fees paid to other carriers. The remaining costs associated with operating the Wireless segment include the costs to operate our customer care organization, back office support and bad debt expense. Wireless service revenue, costs to acquire subscribers, and variable network and interconnection costs fluctuate with the growth in our subscriber base, but certain elements are fixed. Wireline Through our Wireline segment, we provide a broad suite of wireline voice and data communications services to our Wireless segment, other communications companies and targeted business customers. These services include domestic and international data communications using various protocols, such as MPLS technologies, IP, asynchronous transfer mode, or ATM, frame relay, managed network services and voice services. Our IP services can also be combined with our wireless services. In addition, we provide IP and other services to cable MSOs that resell our local and long distance service and or use our back office systems and network assets in support of their telephone service provided over cable facilities primarily to residential end user customers. We are one of the nations largest providers of long distance services and operate all digital long distance and Tier 1 IP networks. For several years, our long distance voice services have experienced an industry wide trend of lower revenue from lower prices and competition from other wireline and wireless communications companies, as well as cable MSOs and Internet service providers. Growth in voice services provided by cable MSOs is accelerating as consumers use cable MSOs as alternatives to local and long distance voice communications providers. We continue to assess the portfolio of services provided by our Wireline segment and are focusing our efforts on IP based services and de emphasizing stand alone voice services and non IP based data services. For example, in addition to increased emphasis on selling IP and managed services, we are converting most of our existing subscribers from ATM and frame relay to more advanced IP technologies, such as MPLS, Sprintlink Frame Relay and Sprintlink ATM, which will reduce our cost structure by moving toward one consolidated data platform that can provide converged services. Over time, this conversion is expected to result in decreases in revenue from frame relay and ATM service offset by increases in IP and MPLS services. We also are taking advantage of the growth in voice services provided by cable MSOs, by providing large cable MSOs with wholesale voice local and long distance services, which they offer as part of their bundled service offerings, as well as traditional voice and data services for their enterprise use. Results of Operations We present consolidated information as well as separate supplemental financial information for our two reportable segments: Wireless and Wireline. The disaggregated financial results for our two reportable segments have been prepared in a manner that is consistent with the basis and manner in which our chief executive officer evaluates segment performance and makes resource allocation decisions. Consequently, segment earnings is defined as wireless or wireline operating income (loss) before other segment expenses, such as depreciation, amortization, severance, exit costs, goodwill and asset impairments, other and merger and integration expenses solely and directly attributable to the segment. Expenses and income items excluded from segment earnings are managed at the corporate level. See note 13 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on our segments. For reconciliations of segment earnings to operating income, the closest generally accepted accounting principles measure, see the tables set forth in Wireless and Wireline below. We generally account for transactions between segments based on fully distributed costs, which we believe approximate fair value. In certain transactions, pricing is set using market rates. 37 Table of Contents Consolidated The following table summarizes our consolidated results of operations. Year Ended December 31, 2008(1) 2007(2) 2006(2) (3) (in millions) Net operating revenues $ 35,635 $ 40,146 $ 41,003 Goodwill impairment 963 29,649 (Loss) income from continuing operations (2,796 ) (29,444 ) 995 Discontinued operations, net 334 Net (loss) income (2,796 ) (29,444 ) 1,329 (1) Our consolidated results of operations include the results of our next generation wireless broadband network. That network was contributed to Clearwire in a transaction that closed on November 28, 2008. For further information on the Clearwire transaction, see note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Our consolidated and wireless results include merged and acquired companies from either the date of merger/acquisition or the start of the month closest to the acquisition date. The results of merged and acquired companies are included as of the following dates: Enterprise Communications Partnership and Alamosa Holdings, Inc. from February 1, 2006; Nextel Partners and UbiquiTel Inc. from July 1, 2006 and Northern PCS Services, LLC from August 1, 2007. The results of Velocita Wireless Holding Corporation are included from the date of acquisition, March 1, 2006, through the date of sale, June 27, 2007. (3) On May 17, 2006, we spun off to our shareholders our local communications business, which is now known as Embarq Corporation and is comprised primarily of what was our local wireline communications segment prior to the spin off. As a result of the spin off, we no longer own any interest in Embarq. The results of Embarq for periods prior to the spin off are presented as discontinued operations. Net operating revenues decreased about 11% in 2008 as compared to 2007, reflecting the decrease in revenues from our Wireless segment, principally due to the decrease in wireless service revenue, and decreased 2% in 2007 as compared to 2006, reflecting the decrease in revenues from our Wireless segment, principally due to the decrease in wireless equipment revenue. For additional information, see Segment Results of Operations below. Loss from continuing operations decreased to a loss of $2.8 billion in 2008, compared to a loss of $29.4 billion in 2007, primarily due to the 2007 goodwill impairment charge of $29.6 billion. Loss from continuing operations increased to a loss of $29.4 billion in 2007, as compared to income of $995 million in 2006, primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $29.6 billion. For additional information, see Segment Results of Operations and Consolidated Information below. In 2008, we incurred a net loss of $2.8 billion as compared to a net loss of $29.4 billion in 2007, due to the reasons stated above. In 2007, we incurred a net loss of $29.4 billion as compared to net income of $1.3 billion in 2006, primarily due to the goodwill impairment charge of $29.6 billion and the absence of income from discontinued operations in 2007. For additional information, see Segment Results of Operations and Consolidated Information below. 38 Table of Contents Presented below are results of operations for our Wireless and Wireline segments, followed by a discussion of consolidated information.

Goodwill impairment is further discussed in the Consolidated Information section. Service Revenue Service revenue consists of fixed monthly recurring charges, variable usage charges and miscellaneous fees such as activation fees, directory assistance, operator assisted calling, equipment protection, late payment and early termination charges and certain regulatory related fees, net of service credits. Service revenue totaled $27.5 billion in 2008, $31.0 billion in 2007, and $31.1 billion in 2006. 39 Table of Contents The following is a summary of our average subscribers and average revenue per subscriber for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007 and 2006. The number of subscribers impacts service revenues, cost of service and bad debt expense, as well as support costs, such as customer care and billing, which are included in general and administrative expenses.

(2) The average subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2007 are inclusive of 170,000 subscribers acquired through our 2007 acquisition of Northern PCS, compared to 4,156,000 subscribers acquired through our 2006 acquisitions of certain PCS Affiliates and Nextel Partners. (3) A summary of changes in net additions to subscribers and average monthly service revenue per subscriber since the first quarter 2006 may be found on pages 35 and 36. Service revenues decreased $3.6 billion, or 11%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. Over half of the decline is due to a decrease in the average number of direct post paid subscribers, and the remaining amount is due to a decline in average monthly service revenue per post paid user. As previously discussed in Overview Wireless Service Revenue Wireless Subscribers, our net post paid subscriber losses have principally been caused by our attracting fewer new subscribers on both the iDEN and CDMA networks in recent periods. See subscriber trends discussed in Wireless Segment Earnings below for expected impact on future periods. Over half of the decline in average monthly service revenue per post paid subscriber in 2008, as compared to 2007, is due to the loss of iDEN subscribers with higher priced service plans and the migration of iDEN subscribers to lower priced plans. Our average monthly service revenue also declined due to other reasons, the most significant of which is the number of service credits accepted by our subscribers on both networks, which increased due to our retention efforts. See discussion of service revenue in Wireless Segment Earnings below. Service revenues decreased $15 million, or less than 1%, in 2007 as compared to 2006, due to a decrease of approximately $220 million in service revenue from our direct post paid subscribers, offset by a net increase of approximately $205 million in service revenue from our prepaid subscribers. The decrease in post paid service revenue was due primarily to a decline in average monthly service revenue per post paid user, and was partially offset by an increase in revenue attributable to the increase in the average number of direct post paid subscribers. The increase in prepaid service revenue was primarily due to an increase in the average number of direct prepaid subscribers, partially offset by a decline in average monthly service revenue per prepaid subscriber. Wholesale, Affiliate and Other Revenue Wholesale, affiliate and other revenues consist primarily of revenues from the sale of wireless services to companies that resell those services to their subscribers and net revenues retained from wireless subscribers residing in PCS Affiliate territories. Wholesale, affiliate and other revenues decreased 11% in 2008 as compared 40 Table of Contents to 2007 due to a decline in average monthly service revenue per wholesale subscriber. Wholesale, affiliate and other revenues increased 22% in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to increases in our wholesale operators subscribers. Cost of Services Cost of services consists primarily of: costs to operate and maintain our CDMA and iDEN networks, including direct switch and cell site costs, such as rent, utilities, maintenance, payroll costs associated with our network employees and spectrum frequency leasing costs; fixed and variable interconnection costs, the fixed component of which consists of monthly flat rate fees for facilities leased from local exchange carriers based on the number of cell sites and switches in service in a particular period and the related equipment installed at each site, and the variable component of which generally consists of per minute use fees charged by wireline providers for calls terminating on their networks, which fluctuates in relation to the level and duration of those terminating calls; long distance costs paid to the Wireline segment; costs to service and repair handsets; roaming fees paid to other carriers; and variable costs relating to payments to third parties for the use of their proprietary data applications, such as ringers, games, music, TV and navigation services by our subscribers. Cost of services increased 2% in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily reflecting increased costs relating to data and voice roaming outside of our networks and increased service and repair costs related to devices with increased functionality. In addition, backhaul costs, including usage of our wireline network, have increased primarily due to increased data usage by our subscribers and the expansion of EV DO Rev. A in our network. These costs have been slightly offset by lower employee related and outside services costs. Cost of services increased 7% in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to increased network costs. Specifically we experienced increased roaming expenses, mainly from subscribers of our CDMA services, due to increased data and voice usage outside of our CDMA network. We also experienced an increase in the operational costs of our cell sites and switches, including increases in rent and fixed and variable interconnection costs due to the increase in usage, number of cell sites and related equipment in service. Subsidy We recognize equipment revenue and corresponding costs of handsets and accessories when title to the handset or accessory passes to the dealer or end user customer. Our marketing plans assume that handsets typically will be sold at prices below our cost, which is consistent with industry practice, as subscriber retention efforts often include providing incentives to subscribers such as offering new handsets at discounted prices. We reduce equipment revenue for these discounts offered directly to the customer, or for certain payments to third party dealers to reimburse the dealer for point of sale discounts that are offered to the end user subscriber. Additionally, we reduce the cost of handsets by any rebates that we earn from the supplier. Cost of handsets and accessories also includes order fulfillment related expenses and write downs of handset and related accessory inventory for shrinkage and obsolescence. Equipment costs in excess of the revenues generated from equipment sales (referred to in our industry as subsidy) as a percentage of equipment revenues increased to 144% in 2008 from 94% in 2007 and 55% in 2006. The increase in subsidy in 2008 as compared to 2007 is primarily due to: a 23% decline in equipment revenue, primarily due to a decrease in the number of handsets sold, slightly offset by, 41 Table of Contents a 3% decrease in the cost of handsets and accessories, primarily due to a decrease in the number of handsets sold which was mostly offset by an increase in the average cost per handset sold as we continue to sell a greater number of higher priced units, including several new devices with increased functionality introduced during 2008. The increase in subsidy in 2007 as compared to 2006 is primarily due to: an 18% decline in equipment revenue, primarily due to a decrease in the average sales price of handsets due to more aggressive acquisition and retention handset pricing, which was only slightly offset by an increase in the number of handsets sold, and a 2% increase in the cost of handsets and accessories due to the increase in the number of handsets sold and an increase in the average cost of the units sold. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Sales and marketing costs primarily consist of customer acquisition costs, including commissions paid to our indirect dealers, third party distributors and direct sales force for new handset activations and upgrades, residual payments to our indirect dealers, payroll and facilities costs associated with our direct sales force, retail stores and marketing employees, advertising, media programs and sponsorships, including costs related to branding. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for billing, customer care and information technology operations, bad debt expense and back office support activities, including collections, legal, finance, human resources, strategic planning and technology and product development. Sales and marketing expense decreased 13% in 2008 from 2007 as compared to an increase of 9% in 2007 from 2006. The decline in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2008 is primarily attributable to our decline in gross subscriber additions and a decline in advertising expenses and labor related costs due to our cost reduction activities. During the year ended December 31, 2007, advertising expenses increased, as we promoted our brand in an effort to gain market share and build loyalty among existing subscribers. We also increased compensation of our post paid third party dealers for both new subscriber additions and upgrades. General and administrative costs decreased 9% in 2008 from 2007 as compared to an increase of 5% in 2007 from 2006. The decline in general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 is principally due to the decrease in bad debt expense and lower employee related costs, offset by an increase in customer care related costs. Bad debt expense was $632 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 representing a $264 million decline, as compared to the $262 million increase in 2007 to $896 million. Our improvement in bad debt expense is largely attributable to credit policies for new customers and customer care initiatives we launched in late 2007. Specifically, our ratio of subscribers with a prime credit rating to those with a subprime credit rating has continued to improve since December 31, 2007. We also have several customer care and collection activities designed to proactively contact subscribers to ensure they are on appropriate service plans based on their usage and to negotiate payment arrangements designed to help the customers through difficult financial times. As a result, we have noted a decrease in involuntary churn and the number of accounts written off. The increase in bad debt expense in 2007 was due to higher average write offs per account due to a higher number of subscribers per account, increased add a phone activity, increased incidence of overages, increased fees related to data services and increased credit extended in early 2007 and 2006. Wireless Segment Earnings Wireless segment earnings decreased about $3.1 billion, or 32%, in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to the decline in wireless service revenue principally driven by net direct subscriber losses. Wireless segment earnings decreased about $1.8 billion, or 15%, in 2007 from 2006, primarily due to increases in costs to acquire our subscribers, lower equipment revenue, and increases in network and interconnection costs. Wireless segment earnings were $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008. 42 Table of Contents We expect to experience continued downward pressure on Wireless segment earnings and cash flow from operations until we can reverse our net direct subscriber losses described in Wireless Service Revenue. Given the current economic environment and the difficulties the economic uncertainties create in forecasting, we are unable to say with assurance the expected effects of 2009 direct subscriber declines on our 2009 wireless service revenue. However, our actual 2008 direct subscriber losses of 5.1 million can be expected to cause 2009 service revenue to be approximately 6% lower than service revenues would have been had we not lost those subscribers. If we were to experience the same level of direct subscriber losses in 2009 as we did in 2008, direct subscriber losses would further reduce 2009 service revenue by approximately 5%. We have also recently lowered the prices of certain handset devices and continue to make targeted investments to improve subscriber results, which may cause an increase in our equipment net subsidy, which could increase the overall cost to acquire and retain subscribers. Management is implementing a cost reduction program designed to decrease our cost structure by reducing our labor and other costs; however, we do not expect that the reduction in cash costs will offset the reduced cash expected from our service revenue declines in the near term.

Voice Revenues Voice revenues decreased 12% in 2008 as compared to 2007 and decreased 7% in 2007 as compared to 2006. The 2008 decrease was primarily driven by volume declines due to customer churn as well as overall price declines. The 2007 decrease was primarily a result of certain business subscribers that were transferred to Embarq as part of the spin off in the second quarter 2006, as well as a decrease in our customer base and continued price declines. Also contributing to the decrease is the loss of conference line subscribers due to the final transition of those activities in the third quarter 2006 as part of the sale of that business. Our retail business experienced a decrease in voice revenues of 17% in 2008 as compared to 2007, and a decrease of 22% in 2007 as compared to 2006. The 2008 decrease was driven by a combination of volume declines and rate declines given customer mix. The 2007 decrease was primarily due to the loss of accounts related to the Embarq spin off, the sale of our conference line business and lower prices. 43 Table of Contents Voice revenues related to our wholesale business decreased 14% in 2008 as compared to 2007 and increased about 1% in 2007 as compared to 2006. The 2008 decrease reflected volume declines due to customer churn as well as overall price declines. Minute volume increases accounted for the 2007 increase, primarily as a result of our relationship with Embarq. We began providing wholesale long distance services to Embarq following the spin off. Rate declines slightly offset the minute volume increase. Voice revenues generated from the provision of services to the Wireless segment represented 26% of total voice revenues in 2008 as compared to 23% in 2007 and 17% in 2006. Data Revenues Data revenues reflect sales of legacy data services, including ATM, frame relay and managed network services. Data revenues decreased 21% in 2008 as compared to 2007 and decreased 16% in 2007 as compared to 2006 due to declines in frame relay and ATM services as subscribers migrated to IP based technologies. These declines were partially offset by growth in IP revenues. Data revenues generated from the provision of services to the Wireless segment represented 13% of total data revenue in 2008 as compared to 8% in 2007 and 5% in 2006. Internet Revenues Internet revenues reflect sales of IP based data services, including MPLS. Internet revenues increased 36% in 2008 as compared to 2007 and increased 38% in 2007 as compared to 2006. The increases were due to higher IP revenues as business subscribers increasingly migrate to MPLS services, as well as revenue growth in our cable VoIP business, which experienced a 52% increase in 2008 as compared to 2007 and an 80% increase in 2007 as compared to 2006. Internet revenues generated from the provision of services to the Wireless segment represented 9% of total Internet revenues in 2008 as compared to 5% in 2007 and 2% in 2006. Other Revenues Other revenues, which primarily consist of sales of customer premises equipment, or CPE, decreased 14% in 2008 as compared to 2007 and decreased 22% in 2007 as compared to 2006 as a result of fewer projects in 2008 and 2007. Costs of Services and Products Costs of services and products include access costs paid to local phone companies, other domestic service providers and foreign phone companies to complete calls made by our domestic subscribers, costs to operate and maintain our networks and costs of equipment. Costs of services and products decreased 6% in 2008 from 2007 and decreased 1% in 2007 from 2006. The decrease in 2008 is mainly due to improved access cost rates and declining volumes. The decrease in 2007 relates to decreased costs due to declining volumes and improved access cost rates in the retail business, partially offset by increased activity in the wholesale and cable VoIP businesses. Service gross margin percentage decreased from 32% in 2006 to 31% in 2007 and then increased to 34% in 2008, primarily as a result of revenue growth in our cable VoIP business and improved access cost rates. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense increased 2% in 2008 as compared to 2007 and decreased 13% in 2007 as compared to 2006. The 2008 increase reflected the Vonage settlement in 2007, not present in 2008. The 2007 decline was due primarily to recognition of a license from Vonage covering the use of certain patents 44 Table of Contents within our patent portfolio, as well as a reduction in employee headcount, reduced commissions as a result of the spin off of Embarq and decreased customer care and billing expenses due to a smaller customer base. These declines were partially offset by increases in costs associated with cable VoIP support. Selling, general and administrative expense includes charges for estimated bad debt expense. Each quarter we reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts based on customer specific indicators, as well as historical trends and industry data, to ensure we are adequately reserved. In 2008, bad debt expense decreased by 13% due to less customer specific reserves. Total selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net services revenues was 15% in 2008, 15% in 2007 and 16% in 2006. Wireline Segment Earnings Wireline segment earnings increased $101 million, or 9%, in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to an increase in Internet revenue, and a decrease in cost of services and products, partially offset by decreases in voice and data revenue. Wireline segment earnings increased $83 million, or 8%, in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to an increase in Internet revenue, and a decrease in selling, general and administrative expenses due to the recognition of the Vonage license, partially offset by decreases in voice and data revenue. Consolidated Information Year Ended December 31, Change from Previous Year 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs 2007 2007 vs 2006 (in millions) Selling, general and administrative expenses $ (11,355 ) $ (12,673 ) $ (11,957 ) (10 )% 6 % Severance, exit costs and asset impairments (817 ) (440 ) (207 ) 86 % 113 % Goodwill impairment (963 ) (29,649 ) NM NM Depreciation (5,953 ) (5,621 ) (5,738 ) 6 % (2 )% Amortization (2,443 ) (3,312 ) (3,854 ) (26 )% (14 )% Interest expense (1,362 ) (1,433 ) (1,533 ) (5 )% (7 )% Interest income 97 151 301 (36 )% (50 )% Equity in losses of unconsolidated affiliates and other, net (129 ) (6 ) 26 NM NM Realized (loss) gain on sale or exchange of investments (24 ) 253 205 NM 23 % Income tax benefit (expense) 1,264 331 (488 ) NM NM Discontinued operations, net 334 NM (100 )% Net (loss) income (2,796 ) (29,444 ) 1,329 NM NM NM Not Meaningful Selling, General and Administrative Expenses Selling, general and administrative expenses are primarily allocated at the segment level and are discussed in the segment earnings discussions above. The selling, general and administrative expenses related to the Wireless segment were $10.0 billion in 2008, $11.2 billion in 2007 and $10.4 billion in 2006. The selling, general and administrative expenses related to the Wireline segment were $965 million in 2008, $943 million in 2007 and $1.1 billion in 2006. In addition to the selling, general and administrative expenses discussed in the segment earnings, we incurred corporate general and administrative expenses of $278 million in 2008, $359 million in 2007 and $246 million in 2006, including certain merger and integration expenses of $29 million in 2008, $172 million in 45 Table of Contents 2007 and $222 million in 2006 as discussed in Merger and Integration Expenses below. Also included in corporate general and administrative expenses are expenses of $249 million in 2008 and $189 million in 2007 related to our development of a next generation broadband wireless network. As we contributed the assets related to this effort to Clearwire on November 28, 2008, we will not incur similar expenses in future periods. Merger and Integration Expenses We incurred $130 million of merger and integration expenses in 2008, $516 million in 2007 and $413 million in 2006, of which $101 million, $344 million and $191 million are included in our Wireless segment for 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively, as the expenses are solely and directly attributable to that segment. These expenses are generally classified as selling, general and administrative and cost of products as appropriate on our consolidated statement of operations. Merger and integration expenses that are not solely and directly attributable to the Wireless segment are included in our Corporate segment and are classified as selling, general and administrative expenses. Merger and integration expenses decreased in 2008 as compared to 2007 as we did not incur these costs in the second half of the year. Merger and integration expenses increased in 2007 as compared to 2006, primarily due to costs to provide wireless devices that operate seamlessly between the CDMA and iDEN networks. Severance, Exit Costs and Asset Impairments We had severance, exit costs and asset impairments of $817 million in 2008 as compared to $440 million for 2007 and $207 million for 2006. We recorded severance and exit costs of $355 million in 2008 related to the separation of employees and continued organizational realignment initiatives. We recorded severance and exit costs of $277 million in 2007 related to the separation of employees, exit costs primarily associated with the sale of Velocita Wireless and continued organizational realignment initiatives associated with the Sprint Nextel merger and the PCS Affiliate and Nextel Partners acquisitions. In 2006, we recorded $138 million in severance and exit costs primarily related to our realignment initiatives associated with the Sprint Nextel merger and integration initiatives. In 2008, we recorded asset impairments of $435 million primarily related to cell site development costs and network asset equipment no longer necessary for managements strategic plans. In addition, we also recorded losses on disposition of assets of $27 million in 2008. During 2007, we had asset impairments of $163 million, which related to the write off of network assets, including site development costs, the loss on the sale of Velocita Wireless, and the closing of retail stores due to integration activities. We wrote off $69 million of assets in 2006 primarily related to software asset impairments. Goodwill Impairment During the fourth quarters 2008 and 2007, we performed our annual goodwill analyses and recorded non cash goodwill impairment charges of $963 million and $29.649 billion, respectively. Refer to note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation expense increased 6% in 2008 from 2007, primarily due to increases to our in service network assets. These increases were partially offset by certain assets becoming fully depreciated and the impact of our annual review of depreciation rates and lives completed in the first quarter 2008. These rate changes were primarily related to net changes in the remaining service lives of assets primarily in the CDMA network. The impact of these changes reduced annual depreciation expense by about $135 million, including $105 million in the Wireless segment and about $30 million in the Wireline segment. 46 Table of Contents Depreciation expense in 2007 declined 2% as compared to 2006. The 2007 depreciation expense includes about a $400 million decrease related to depreciation rate changes with respect to our CDMA and Wireline networks assets, resulting from our 2007 depreciable lives study. These rate changes are primarily related to net changes in the remaining service lives of certain assets. The decreases resulting from the depreciation rate changes were fully offset by normal additions to our network asset base. Amortization expense declined 26% in 2008 from 2007 and declined 14% in 2007 from 2006, primarily due to the amortization of the customer relationships acquired as part of the Sprint Nextel merger, which are amortized using the sum of the years digits method, resulting in higher amortization rates in early periods that decline over time. See note 4 to the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our definite lived intangible assets. Interest Expense Interest expense decreased $71 million in 2008 as compared to 2007, due to the reduction in our average effective interest rates. This was partially offset by the increase in the average long term debt balance. The effective interest rate on our average long term debt balance of $22.9 billion in 2008 was 6.6%. The effective interest rate on our average long term debt balance of $21.8 billion in 2007 was 6.9%. Interest expense in 2007 decreased 7% as compared to 2006, primarily reflecting the reduction in our average debt balance. The effective interest rate on our average long term debt balance of $21.8 billion in 2007 was 6.9%, unchanged from 2006 on an average long term debt balance of $23.2 billion. Interest Income Interest income includes interest earned on marketable debt securities and cash equivalents. Interest income decreased $54 million in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily due to the lower interest rates and the one time interest income on income taxes recorded in 2007 of $31 million. In 2007, interest income decreased 50%, as compared to 2006, primarily due to a decrease in the average temporary cash investments balance. Equity in Losses of Unconsolidated Affiliates and Other, Net This item consists mainly of our losses from our equity method investments, gain/loss on early retirement of debt and other miscellaneous income/expense. Realized (Loss) Gain on Sale or Exchange of Investments During 2008, we recognized loss on investments of $24 million, primarily due to the impairment of our investment in Nextwave. In 2007, we recognized a gain from the sale of investments of $253 million, primarily due to a pre tax gain of $240 million related to the sale of a portion of our equity interest in Virgin Mobile USA, LLC, or VMU. See note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information. During 2006, we recognized a gain from the sale of investments of $205 million, primarily due to $433 million of gains on the sales of our investment in NII Holdings, Inc., partially offset by a loss of $274 million from the change in fair value of an option contract associated with our investment in NII Holdings, as described in note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Income Tax Benefit (Expense) Our consolidated effective tax rates were 31.1% in 2008, 1.1% in 2007 and 32.9% in 2006. The 2008 and 2007 effective tax rates were impacted by $794 million of the $963 million non cash impairment charge in 2008 and $29.3 billion of the $29.6 billion non cash impairment charge in 2007 related to goodwill as substantially all of the charges are not separately deductible for tax purposes. Information regarding the items that caused the effective income tax rates to vary from the statutory federal rate for income taxes related to continuing operations can be found in note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 47 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations, Net Discontinued operations reflect the results of our previously held Local segment from January 1 through May 17, 2006, the date of the Embarq spin off. Additional information regarding our discontinued operations can be found in note 16 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Net (Loss) Income We recorded a net loss of $2.8 billion in 2008 compared to a net loss of $29.4 billion in 2007. Our 2008 net loss was primarily due to decreases in our Wireless segment revenue, the goodwill impairment charge of $963 million and the asset impairment charge of $435 million that we recorded in 2008, while the 2007 net loss was principally due to a one time non cash goodwill impairment charge in our Wireless segment and a decline in the performance of the Wireless segment. We recorded net income of $1.3 billion in 2006 primarily due to increased revenue in our Wireless segment resulting from the Sprint Nextel merger and the PCS Affiliate and Nextel Partners acquisitions. We expect downward pressure on our consolidated results of operations in the near term caused principally by the expected decline in Wireless segment earnings and severance costs associated with our work force reduction announced in January 2009. See Forward Looking Statements. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates We consider the following accounting policies and estimates to be the most important to our financial position and results of operations, either because of the significance of the financial statement item or because they require the exercise of significant judgment and or use of significant estimates. While management believes that the estimates used are reasonable, actual results could differ from those estimates. Revenue Recognition and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Policies Operating revenues primarily consist of wireless service revenues, revenues generated from handset and accessory sales, revenues from wholesale operators and PCS Affiliates, as well as local and long distance voice, data and Internet revenues. Service revenues consist of fixed monthly recurring charges, variable usage charges such as roaming, directory assistance and operator assisted calling and miscellaneous fees, such as activation, upgrade, late payment, reconnection and early termination fees and certain regulatory related fees. We recognize service revenues as services are rendered and equipment revenue when title passes to the dealer or end user customer. We recognize revenue for access charges and other services charged at fixed amounts ratably over the service period, net of credits and adjustments for service discounts, billing disputes and fraud or unauthorized usage. We recognize excess wireless usage and long distance revenue at contractual rates per minute as minutes are used. Additionally, we recognize excess wireless data usage based on kilobytes and one time use charges, such as for the use of premium services, when rendered. As a result of the cutoff times of our multiple billing cycles each month, we are required to estimate the amount of subscriber revenues earned but not billed from the end of each bill cycle to the end of each reporting period. These estimates are based primarily on rate plans in effect and our historical usage and billing patterns. Subscriber revenue earned but not billed represented about 12% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2008. We establish an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable sufficient to cover probable and reasonably estimable losses. Because of the number of accounts that we have, it is not practical to review the collectibility of each of those accounts individually when we determine the amount of our allowance for doubtful accounts each period, although we do perform some account level analysis with respect to large wireless and wireline subscribers. Our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts considers a number of factors, including collection experience, aging of the accounts receivable portfolios, the credit quality of our subscriber base, estimated proceeds from future bad debt sales and other qualitative considerations, including macro economic 48 Table of Contents factors. The accounting estimates related to the recognition of revenue require us to make assumptions about future billing adjustments for disputes with subscribers, unauthorized usage, and future returns and mail in rebates on handset sales. The allowance amounts recorded represent our best estimate of future outcomes; to the extent that our actual experience differs significantly from historical trends, the required allowance amounts could differ from our estimate. Any resulting adjustments would change the net accounts receivable reported on our consolidated balance sheet, and bad debt expense, in the case of estimates related to doubtful accounts, or revenue, in the case of estimates related to other allowances, reported in our results of operations in future periods. For example, if our allowance for doubtful accounts estimate were to change by 10%, it would result in a corresponding change in bad debt expense of about $26 million for the Wireless segment and $1 million for the Wireline segment. Device and Accessory Inventory Inventories of handsets and accessories in the Wireless segment are stated at the lower of cost or market. We determine cost by the first in, first out method. Handset costs and related revenues generated from handset sales, or handset subsidies, are recognized at the time of sale. We do not recognize the expected handset subsidies prior to the time of sale because the promotional discount decision is made at the point of sale and or because we expect to recover the handset subsidies through service revenues. As of December 31, 2008, we held $528 million of inventory. We analyze the realizable value of our handset and other inventory on a quarterly basis. This analysis includes assessing obsolescence, sales forecasts, product life cycle, marketplace and other considerations. If our assessments regarding the above factors change, we may be required to sell handsets at a higher subsidy or potentially record expense in future periods prior to the point of sale to the extent that we expect that we will be unable to sell handsets with a service contract. Other than temporary Impairment of Investments and Marketable Securities We hold a portfolio of investments that include marketable and non marketable debt and equity securities. We evaluate such investments for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. Other than temporary impairment occurs when the fair value of an investment is below our carrying value, and we determine that difference is not recoverable in the near future. This evaluation requires significant judgment regarding, but not limited to, the severity and duration of the impairment; our ability and intent to hold the securities until recovery; financial condition, liquidity, and near term prospects of the issuer, specific events, and other factors. Our assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to changes in facts and circumstances. Our only material investment is our $3.9 billion investment in Clearwire, which we have held since we closed our transaction with Clearwire on November 28, 2008. Our book value per share in Clearwire was $10.65 per share at year end, as compared to the year end Clearwire stock price of $4.93, and the stock price has continued to decline subsequent to the balance sheet date. As further discussed in note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have concluded as of December 31, 2008 that the decline is temporary and the stock price is expected to recover in the near future. We will continue to evaluate our investment in Clearwire every quarter and update our conclusions based upon the facts and circumstances in place at that time. If such facts and circumstance change, for example if Clearwires stock price continues to remain at a depressed level for a longer duration of time, it is possible that we may record an impairment in future periods on this investment that could be material to our results of operations and financial condition. Valuation and Recoverability of Long lived Assets Including Definite Lived Intangible Assets A significant portion of our total assets are long lived assets, consisting primarily of property, plant and equipment and definite lived intangible assets. Changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets, as well as changes in economic or industry factors or in our business or prospects, may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change. 49 Table of Contents Property, plant and equipment represented $22.4 billion of our $58.3 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2008. We generally calculate depreciation on these assets using the straight line method based on estimated economic useful lives as follows: Long lived Assets Estimated Useful Life Average Useful Life Buildings and improvements 3 to 30 years 12 years Network equipment, site costs and software 3 to 30 years 8 years Non network internal use software, office equipment and other 3 to 12 years 4 years We calculate depreciation on certain of our assets using the group life method. Accordingly, ordinary asset retirements and disposals on those assets are charged against accumulated depreciation with no gain or loss recognized. Gains or losses associated with non monetary exchanges and asset retirements or disposals on non network equipment are recorded within asset impairments in the consolidated statements of operations. Since changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets, as well as changes in broad economic or industry factors, may cause the estimated period of use of these assets to change, we perform annual studies to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution, to calculate the remaining life of our asset base. When these factors indicate that an assets useful life is different from the previous assessment, we depreciate the remaining book values prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. During the first quarter 2008, we implemented depreciation rate and life changes with respect to certain assets that comprise the wireless and wireline networks resulting from our annual depreciable lives study. These revised rates reflected both changes in the useful life estimates of certain of our asset groups and adjustments to our accumulated depreciation accounts under the group life depreciation method. The reduced expense associated with the depreciation rate and life changes resulted in an approximately $135 million reduction, or $0.03 per share savings, net of tax, in the net loss for the year ended December 31, 2008. In addition to performing our annual study, we also continue to assess the estimated useful life and future strategic plans of our wireless and wireline network assets, which had a net carrying value of $14.5 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, as of December 31, 2008. A reduction in our estimate of the useful lives of those network assets would cause increased depreciation charges in future periods that could be material. For example, a 10% reduction in the remaining weighted average useful lives of the network assets would increase annual wireless and wireline depreciation expense by about $500 million and $50 million, respectively. In conjunction with our fourth quarter 2008 annual goodwill impairment review, we re assessed the remaining useful lives of our long lived assets and concluded they were appropriate. Intangible assets with definite useful lives represented $3.6 billion of our $58.3 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2008. Definite lived intangible assets consist primarily of customer relationships that are amortized over two to five years using the sum of the years digits method, which we believe best reflects the estimated pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed. Other definite lived intangible assets primarily include certain rights under affiliation agreements that we reacquired in connection with the acquisitions of certain PCS Affiliates and Nextel Partners, which are being amortized over the remaining terms of those affiliation agreements on a straight line basis, and the Nextel and Direct Connect trade names, which are being amortized over ten years on a straight line basis. We also evaluate the remaining useful lives of our definite lived intangible assets each reporting period to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining periods of amortization, which would be addressed prospectively. For example, we review certain trends such as subscriber churn, average revenue per subscriber, revenue, our future plans regarding our networks and changes in marketing strategies, among others. Significant changes in certain trends may cause us to adjust, on a prospective basis, the remaining estimated life of certain of our definite lived intangible assets. For additional information, refer to note 4 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. 50 Table of Contents We review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We determine our long lived asset groups based upon certain factors including assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. Our asset groups consist of wireless and wireline, and the wireless asset group currently includes our intangible assets and our wireless property, plant and equipment. Indicators of impairment for our asset groups include, but are not limited to, a sustained significant decrease in the market price of, or the cash flows expected to be derived from, the asset groups, or a significant change in the extent or manner in which the assets in the group are utilized. A significant amount of judgment is involved in determining the occurrence of an indicator of impairment that requires an evaluation of the recoverability of our long lived assets. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of our assets, a loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the assets. Impairment analyses, when performed, are based on our current business and technology strategy, our views of growth rates for our business, anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability. In conjunction with our 2008 and 2007 annual assessments of goodwill for impairment, we performed a recoverability test of the wireless long lived assets. The future cash flows used in the recoverability test included cash flow projections from our wireless operations along with cash flows associated with the eventual disposition of the long lived assets, which included estimated proceeds from the sale of FCC licenses, trade names and customer relationships. In both the 2008 and 2007 assessments of long lived assets, the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the wireless asset group exceeded its book value and, as a result, no impairment charge was recorded. While the estimated difference in 2008 is significant, it is less than the difference calculated in 2007 due to expected lower future cash flows from our wireless operations. If we continue to have operational challenges, including obtaining and retaining subscribers, our future cash flows may not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of our wireless asset group and we could record asset impairments that are material to our consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In addition to the analyses described above, we periodically assess certain assets that have not yet been deployed in our business, including network equipment, cell site development costs and software in development, to determine if an impairment charge is required. Network equipment and cell site development costs are impaired whenever events or changes in circumstances cause us to conclude the assets are no longer needed to meet managements strategic network plans and will not be deployed. Software development costs are impaired when it is no longer probable that the software project will be deployed. We also periodically assess network equipment that has been removed from the network to determine if an impairment is required. The substantial majority of our $435 million of asset impairments in 2008 related to such assessments. If we continue to have challenges retaining subscribers and as we continue to assess the impact of rebanding the iDEN network, management may conclude in future periods that certain CDMA and iDEN assets will never be either deployed or redeployed, in which case we would recognize a non cash impairment that could be material to our consolidated financial statements. Valuation and Recoverability of Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives represented $19.3 billion of our $58.3 billion in total assets as of December 31, 2008. We have identified FCC licenses and our Sprint and Boost Mobile trademarks as indefinite lived intangible assets, in addition to our previously recorded goodwill, after considering the expected use of the assets, the regulatory and economic environment within which they are being used, and the effects of obsolescence on their use. We review our goodwill, which was solely related to our wireless reporting unit, and other indefinite lived intangibles annually in the fourth quarter for impairment, or more frequently if indicators of impairment exist. We continually assess whether any indicators of impairment exist, which requires a significant amount of judgment. Such indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization; a decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the 51 Table of Contents business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and or slower growth rates, among others. Any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. When required, we first test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our wireless reporting unit with its net book value. If the fair value of the wireless reporting unit exceeds its net book value, goodwill is not deemed to be impaired, and no further testing would be necessary. If the net book value of our wireless reporting unit exceeds its fair value, we perform a second test to measure the amount of impairment loss, if any. To measure the amount of any impairment loss, we determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if our wireless reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination. Specifically, we allocate the estimated fair value of the wireless reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of that reporting unit, including any unrecognized intangible assets, in a hypothetical calculation that would yield the implied fair value of goodwill. If the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet, we record an impairment charge for the difference. The valuation analyses used in our estimate of fair value utilize both income and market approaches as described below: Income Approach: To determine its estimated fair value, we discount the expected cash flows of the wireless reporting unit. We estimate our future cash flows after considering current economic conditions and trends; estimated future operating results, our views of growth rates, anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions; and the availability of necessary technology, network infrastructure, handsets and other devices. The discount rate used represents the estimated weighted average cost of capital, which reflects the overall level of inherent risk involved in our wireless operations and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn. To estimate cash flows beyond the final year of our model, we use a terminal value approach. Under this approach, we use estimated operating income before depreciation and amortization in the final year of our model, adjust it to estimate a normalized cash flow, apply a perpetuity growth assumption and discount by a perpetuity discount factor to determine the terminal value. We incorporate the present value of the resulting terminal value into our estimate of fair value. Market Based Approach: To corroborate the results of the income approach described above, we estimate the fair value of our wireless reporting unit using several market based approaches, including the guideline company method, which focuses on comparing our risk profile and growth prospects to select reasonably similar/guideline publicly traded companies. The determination of the estimated fair value of the wireless reporting unit and other assets and liabilities within the wireless reporting unit requires significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating income before depreciation and amortization, or OIBDA, and capital expenditures forecasts. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. We evaluate the merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to determine the fair value of the wireless reporting unit, as well as the fair values of the corresponding assets and liabilities within the wireless reporting unit, for reasonableness. The allocation of the estimated fair value of the wireless reporting unit to individual assets and liabilities within the wireless reporting unit also requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions. The allocation requires several analyses to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities including, among others, customer relationships, FCC licenses, trademarks and current replacement costs for certain property, plant and equipment. In fourth quarter 2008, we impaired the remaining $963 million of our goodwill. Refer to note 4 of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 52 Table of Contents When required, we test other indefinite lived intangibles for impairment by comparing the assets respective carrying value to estimates of fair value, determined using the direct value method. Our FCC licenses were combined into two units of accounting, which consisted of our 800 MHz, 900 MHz and 1.9 GHz bands as one unit of accounting and our 2.5 GHz band as another unit of accounting. Our licenses in the 2.5 GHz band were subsequently contributed to Clearwire on November 28, 2008; accordingly, we will only have one unit of accounting in future analyses. The accounting estimates related to our indefinite lived intangible assets require us to make significant assumptions about fair values. Our assumptions regarding fair values require significant judgment about economic factors, industry factors and technology considerations, as well as our views regarding the prospects of our business. Changes in these judgments may have a significant effect on the estimated fair values. Tax Valuation Allowances and Uncertain Tax Positions We are required to estimate the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and the deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been reflected in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns for each taxing jurisdiction in which we operate. This process requires our management to make assessments regarding the timing and probability of the ultimate tax impact. We record valuation allowances on deferred tax assets if we determine it is more likely than not that the asset will not be realized. The accounting estimates related to the tax valuation allowance require us to make assumptions regarding the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. These assumptions require significant judgment because actual performance has fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future. The impact that changes in actual performance versus these estimates could have on the realization of tax benefits as reported in our results of operations could be material. We carried an income tax valuation allowance of $711 million as of December 31, 2008. This amount includes a valuation allowance of $473 million for the total tax benefits related to loss carryforwards, subject to utilization restrictions, acquired in connection with certain acquisitions. The remainder of the valuation allowance relates to tax credits and state net operating loss carryforwards. Within our total valuation allowance, we had $95 million related to separate company state net operating losses incurred by our subsidiaries after we acquired them. The valuation allowance was provided on these separate company state net operating loss benefits since these subsidiaries do not have a sufficient history of taxable income. Current analyses of cumulative historical income and qualitative factors indicate that the valuation allowance continues to be appropriate, meaning that we currently believe it is more likely than not that we will not realize such tax benefits in the future. We will continue to monitor these analyses and factors in future periods and may adjust the valuation allowance based on the facts and circumstances existing in future periods. We adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Interpretation No. 48, or FIN 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards, or SFAS, No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, on January 1, 2007. The adoption of FIN 48 did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The accounting estimates related to the liability for uncertain tax positions require us to make judgments regarding the sustainability of each uncertain tax position based on its technical merits. If we determine it is more likely than not a tax position will be sustained based on its technical merits, we record the impact of the position in our consolidated financial statements at the largest amount that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. These estimates are updated based on the facts, circumstances and information available. We are also required to assess at each annual reporting date whether it is reasonably possible that any significant increases or decreases to the unrecognized tax benefits will occur during the next twelve months. See note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding FIN 48. The total unrecognized tax benefits decreased by $205 million during 2008. This reduction was principally attributable to income tax settlements and lapses of statute of limitations in various tax jurisdictions. As these uncertain tax benefits were originally acquired in purchase business combinations, other non current intangible assets were reduced. 53 Table of Contents The various IRS and state income tax reviews disclosed in note 9 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements continue to progress and we expect that certain of these may be completed in the next twelve months. Based on our current knowledge of the examinations, administrative reviews and appellate processes, we believe it is reasonably possible many of our uncertain tax positions could be resolved during the next twelve months which could result in a reduction of up to approximately $200 million in our unrecognized tax benefits. Any changes to the unrecognized tax benefits made after December 31, 2008 will impact tax expense, including those changes related to acquired income tax uncertainties from prior business combinations, except for qualified measurement period adjustments. Actual income tax assets and liabilities could vary from these estimates due to future changes in income tax law, significant changes in the jurisdictions in which we operate, our inability to generate sufficient future taxable income or unpredicted results from the final determination of each years liability by taxing authorities. These changes could have a significant impact on our financial position. Significant New Accounting Pronouncements In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 141R, Business Combinations, which replaces SFAS No. 141, Business Combinations, originally issued in June 2001. SFAS No. 141R will apply to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after January 1, 2009, and this statement could have a material impact on us with respect to business combinations completed after the effective date. Such significant changes include, but are not limited, to the acquirer recording 100% of all assets and liabilities, including goodwill, of the acquired business, generally at their fair values, and acquisition related transaction and restructuring costs being expensed rather than included as part of the purchase price allocation process. In addition, after the effective date, reversals of valuation allowances related to acquired deferred tax assets and changes to acquired income tax uncertainties related to any business combinations, even those completed prior to the statements effective date, will generally be recognized in earnings. In December 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 160, Noncontrolling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements. This statement amends Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, Consolidated Financial Statements, to establish accounting and reporting standards for a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for a deconsolidation of a subsidiary. SFAS No. 160 is effective for our quarterly reporting period ending March 31, 2009. If we were to enter into an arrangement after the effective date of the standard where we are required to consolidate a noncontrolling interest, we would report the noncontrolling interests equity as a component of our shareholders equity in our consolidated balance sheet and report the component of net income or loss and comprehensive income or loss attributable to the noncontrolling interest separately. While certain changes in ownership interests will be treated as equity transactions under the new standard, a gain or loss recognized upon loss of control of a subsidiary will be recognized in the consolidated statement of operations. This practice differs from our current policy of recognizing such gains or losses as a component of equity. In addition, the amount of gain or loss is measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling interest at the date control ceases. In March 2008, the FASB issued SFAS No. 161, Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities. This statement amends SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, by requiring expanded disclosures about an entitys derivative instruments and hedging activities. SFAS No. 161 is effective for our quarterly reporting period ending March 31, 2009. We are in the process of evaluating the impact of this statement on the disclosures included in the notes to our consolidated financial statements. Financial Condition Our consolidated assets were $58.3 billion as of December 31, 2008, which included $22.9 billion of intangible assets, and $64.3 billion as of December 31, 2007, which included $28.1 billion of intangible assets. The decrease in our consolidated assets was primarily a result of the amortization of $2.4 billion related to our definite lived intangible assets, goodwill impairment of $963 million, decrease in accounts receivable balances of $835 million mainly due to declining revenues, decrease in our device and access inventory of $410 million 54 Table of Contents reflecting managements decision to lower inventory levels and the decrease in our deferred tax assets of $354 million. Our consolidated liabilities were $38.6 billion as of December 31, 2008 and $42.2 billion as of December 31, 2007. The decrease in our consolidated liabilities was primarily as a result of a $1.8 billion decrease in our accounts payable, accrued expenses and other current liabilities as a result of a reduction in our obligations relating to capital expenditures, inventory and other items, reflecting lower levels of purchasing activity in the business, a decrease in our deferred tax liabilities of $1.5 billion, and a net decrease in our debt, financing and capital lease obligations of $520 million. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for additional information on the change in cash and cash equivalents. Liquidity and Capital Resources Management exercises discretion regarding the liquidity and capital resource needs of our business segments. This responsibility includes the ability to prioritize the use of capital and debt capacity, to determine cash management policies and to make decisions regarding the timing and amount of capital expenditures. Cash Flow Year Ended December 31, Change 2008 2007 2006 2008 vs. 2007 2007 vs. 2006 (in millions) Cash provided by operating activities $ 6,179 $ 9,245 $ 10,958 (33 )% (16 )% Cash used in investing activities (4,250 ) (6,377 ) (11,392 ) (33 )% (44 )% Cash used in financing activities (484 ) (2,668 ) (6,423 ) (82 )% (58 )% At December 31, 2008, cash and cash equivalents were $3.7 billion as compared to $2.2 billion as of December 31, 2007. Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $6.2 billion in 2008 decreased $3.1 billion from 2007, primarily due to a $3.8 billion decrease in cash received from our subscribers as a result of declining service revenues from our post paid subscribers. This was offset by a decrease of $1.2 billion in cash paid to our suppliers and employees. Net cash provided by operating activities of $9.2 billion in 2007 decreased $1.7 billion from 2006 reflecting a decline in our earnings, primarily due to a decrease in cash flows from discontinued operations of $903 million, a decrease in cash received from subscribers of $779 million primarily due to a decrease in service revenues as we experienced lower average monthly service revenue per subscriber in 2007, an increase in cash paid to our suppliers and employees of $285 million, and a decrease in interest received of $151 million due to a decrease in average commercial paper and temporary cash balances held during the year offset by a decrease of $311 million in cash paid for interest on debt due to the retirement of debt and cash paid for taxes. Net cash provided by operating activities for both 2008 and 2007 is net of cash used for operating activities of approximately $300 million that related to our operations that were contributed to Clearwire. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for 2008 decreased by $2.1 billion from 2007, primarily due to the decrease in capital expenditures of $2.4 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007 mainly due to lower number of cell sites built in 2008, reduced capacity needs, fewer IT projects as well as substantial completion in 2007 of various initiatives that were undertaken in our Wireless segment, an increase in the proceeds from sales and maturities of marketable securities of $189 million and a decrease in the purchase of marketable securities of $143 million in 2008 compared to 2007. Net cash used in investing activities for 2008 was also impacted by the proceeds of $213 million that we received from Clearwire as partial reimbursement of the financing that we provided in 2008 to 55 Table of Contents our 4G wireless broadband business. In addition, we used $287 million in 2007 to acquire Northern PCS, a PCS Affiliate. These decreases were partially offset by the $866 million in cash collateral received from our securities loan agreements in 2007 and the decrease in net sales of our investments of $317 million. The $866 million in cash received from our securities loan agreements is fully offset during 2007 by cash used to pay off our securities loan agreement as described in the Financing Activities section below. Net cash used in investing activities of $6.4 billion decreased $5.0 billion from 2006 primarily due to a $10.2 billion decrease in cash paid for acquisitions in 2007 as compared to 2006 when we acquired Alamosa Holdings, UbiquiTel, Velocita Wireless, Enterprise Communications and Nextel Partners for $10.5 billion compared to $287 million that we paid for the acquisition of Northern PCS in 2007. Net cash used in investing activities for 2007 also decreased due to a $1.2 billion decrease in capital expenditures from 2006 due to fewer cell sites, capacity modifications and inventory reductions in our Wireless segment and decreased investment in transport and switching equipment related to voice and cable subscribers, and the collateral of $866 million in cash received back from our securities loan agreements in 2007, compared to $866 million used to collaterize securities loan agreements in 2006. This was offset by a net decrease in proceeds from sale and maturities of marketable securities, investments and assets net of purchases of $1.8 billion, and $6.3 billion in proceeds received in 2006 in connection with the spin off of our Local segment, including $1.8 billion received from Embarq at the time of the spin off and proceeds from the sale of Embarq notes of $4.4 billion. Net cash used in investing activities for 2008 and 2007 include expenditures of approximately $600 million and $700 million, respectively, related to capital assets and FCC licenses that were contributed to Clearwire. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $484 million during 2008 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $2.7 billion in 2007. Year to date activities as of December 31, 2008 include the draw down of $2.5 billion under our revolving bank credit facility in February 2008 and the net proceeds from the financing obligation with TowerCo Acquisition LLC in September 2008 of $645 million, offset by the early redemption of $1.25 billion of our senior notes in June 2008, the extinguishment in September 2008 of $235 million of US Unwired Inc.s 10% Second Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2012, the extinguishment in September 2008 of $250 million of Alamosa (Delaware), Inc.s 8.5% Senior Notes due 2012, the repayment of $1.5 billion of our revolving bank credit facility in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 and net maturities of commercial paper of $379 million. Net cash used in financing activities of $2.7 billion during 2007 decreased $3.8 billion compared to 2006, primarily due to a decrease in cash used for debt and credit facility payments of $6.7 billion. In 2007, we made principal and debt repayments of $1.4 billion compared to payments in 2006 of $4.3 billion in payments and retirements related to our senior notes and capital lease obligations, $3.2 billion related to the retirement of our term loan and $500 million to retire the Nextel Partners credit facility offset by $135 million in net maturities of commercial paper in 2007 compared to net issuances of $514 million in 2006, payment of $866 million in 2007 to settle collaterized borrowings compared to proceeds of $866 million received from securities loan agreements in 2006 and proceeds of $1.5 billion in 2007, including $750 million from our unsecured loan agreement with Export Development Canada and $750 million in principal from the sale of floating rate notes due 2010 compared to proceeds of $2.0 billion in principal amount of 6.0% senior serial redeemable notes received in 2006 that are due in 2016. Pursuant to our share repurchase program, we repurchased about 87 million of our common shares for $1.8 billion in 2007 compared to 98 million of our common shares repurchased in 2006 for $1.6 billion. We received $57 million, $344 million and $405 million in 2008, 2007 and 2006, respectively in proceeds from common share issuances, primarily resulting from exercises of employee options. We paid cash dividends of $286 million in 2007 compared to $296 million in 2006. During 2006, we used $247 million to retire our Seventh series redeemable preferred shares. 56 Table of Contents Discontinued Operations On May 17, 2006, we completed the spin off of Embarq. In connection with the spin off, Embarq transferred to our parent company $2.1 billion in cash and about $4.5 billion of Embarq senior notes in partial consideration for, and as a condition to, our transfer to Embarq of the local communications business. Embarq also retained about $665 million in debt obligations of its subsidiaries. The cash and senior notes were transferred by our parent company to our finance subsidiary, Sprint Capital Corporation, in satisfaction of indebtedness owed by our parent company to Sprint Capital. On May 19, 2006, Sprint Capital sold the Embarq senior notes to the public, and received about $4.4 billion in net proceeds. Embarq provided $903 million of net cash to us in 2006 excluding cash received from Embarq in connection with the spin off. Capital Requirements We currently anticipate that future funding needs in the near term will principally relate to: operating expenses relating to our segment operations; capital expenditures, particularly with respect to the capacity and upgrading of our wireless networks and the deployment of new technologies in our networks; scheduled debt service requirements; amounts required to be expended in connection with the Report and Order; certain costs of compliance with regulatory mandates; and other general corporate expenditures. Liquidity As of December 31, 2008, our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities totaled $3.7 billion. We depend on these funds as well as cash provided by operating activities and cash available under our revolving bank credit facility to satisfy our liquidity needs. Our revolving bank credit facility expires in December 2010. In February 2008, we drew down $2.5 billion under our revolving bank credit facility. The proceeds were used to repay $1.7 billion in senior notes during the second and third quarters of 2008 and $1.5 billion of our revolving bank credit facility in the third and fourth quarters of 2008. In April 2008, we repaid in full all outstanding amounts under our commercial paper program, which we subsequently terminated. On November 3, 2008, we entered into an agreement to amend the terms and conditions of our revolving bank credit facility giving us greater flexibility regarding our financial covenants. Pursuant to the amendment, the ratio of total indebtedness to trailing four quarters earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other non recurring charges increased from no more than 3.5 to 1.0 to no more than 4.25 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2008, the ratio was 3.0 to 1.0. The new terms of the revolving bank credit facility provide for an interest rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a margin of between 2.50% and 3.00%, depending on our debt ratings. The interest rate prior to the amendment was LIBOR plus a margin of 0.75%. Certain of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the revolving bank credit facility. Under this revolving bank credit facility, we may not pay cash dividends unless our ratio of total indebtedness is less than 2.5 to 1.0. In addition, the amendment reduced the revolving bank credit facility from $6.0 billion to $4.5 billion. We also reduced the outstanding loan balance from $2.0 billion to $1.0 billion. As of December 31, 2008, we had $2.1 billion in letters of credit, including a $2.0 billion letter of credit required by the Report and Order to reconfigure the 800 MHz band, outstanding under our $4.5 billion revolving bank credit facility. As a result of the outstanding borrowings under the revolving bank credit facility and the outstanding letters of credit, each of which directly impacts the availability of the revolving bank credit facility, we had $1.4 billion of borrowing capacity available under our revolving bank credit facility as of December 31, 2008. 57 Table of Contents A default under our credit facilities could trigger defaults under our other debt obligations, including our senior notes, which in turn could result in the maturities of certain debt obligations being accelerated. The indentures that govern our outstanding senior notes also require that we comply with various covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness and liens by us and our subsidiaries. All three agencies rate our senior unsecured debt below investment grade. On May 1, 2008, Standard & Poors lowered our rating to BB. They rate our outlook as stable. On December 10, 2008, Moodys Investors Service lowered our rating to Ba2. At the same time, they raised our amended bank credit facility rating to Baa2. They rate our outlook as negative. On February 19, 2009, Fitch Ratings lowered our rating to BB. They rate our outlook as negative. Downgrades of our current ratings to below investment grade do not accelerate scheduled principal payments of our existing debt; however, downgrades may cause us to incur higher interest costs on our borrowings and could negatively impact our access to the public capital markets. As of December 31, 2008, we had working capital of $2.1 billion compared to a working capital deficit of $441 million as of December 31, 2007, with the change primarily due to the reduction in our current liabilities. In addition, during 2008, we reclassified approximately $350 million in deferred tax assets out of working capital due to the anticipated timing of the realization of those deferred tax benefits. This reclassification reduced our long term deferred tax liabilities and our current deferred tax assets. In light of conditions in our business and financial markets, we decided in early 2008 that we will not pay dividends for the foreseeable future. In addition, under our amended bank credit facility, we are currently restricted from paying any cash dividends as a result of our ratio of total indebtedness as described above. Future Outlook We are committed to both adding new and retaining our wireless subscribers in order to reverse the negative subscriber trends that we have experienced in recent periods. These subscriber losses have and will further decrease our earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, or adjusted EBITDA, as defined by our revolving bank credit facility. Management is implementing a cost reduction program designed to decrease our cost structure by reducing our labor and other costs; however we do not expect that the reduction in cash costs will offset the reduced cash expected from our service revenue declines described above. See Forward Looking Statements. Our decline in adjusted EBITDA has also caused the ratio of total indebtedness to trailing four quarters earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other non recurring charges to increase. We currently expect to remain in compliance with our covenants and expect to be able to meet our debt service requirements through at least the end of 2010, although there can be no assurance that we will do so. Although we expect to improve our subscriber results, if we do not execute as planned, depending on the severity of the actual subscriber results versus what we currently anticipate, it is possible that we would not remain in compliance with our covenants or be able to meet our debt service obligations, which could result in acceleration of our indebtedness. If such unforeseen events occur, we may engage with our lenders to obtain appropriate waivers or amendments of our credit facilities or refinance borrowings, although there is no assurance we would be successful in any of these actions. Specifically, we expect to be able to meet our currently identified funding needs for at least the next 12 months by using: our anticipated cash flows from operating activities as well as our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities on hand; and or any remaining borrowing capacity available under our revolving bank credit facility. 58 Table of Contents In making this assessment, we have considered: anticipated levels of capital expenditures and FCC license acquisitions; anticipated payments under the Report and Order, as supplemented; any contributions we may make to our pension plan, which has been negatively impacted by the high degree of volatility in the global financial markets experienced during the year ended December 31, 2008; scheduled debt service requirements; and other future contractual obligations. If there are material changes in our business plans, or currently prevailing or anticipated economic conditions in any of our markets or competitive practices in the mobile wireless communications industry, or if other presently unexpected circumstances arise that have a material effect on our cash flow or profitability, anticipated cash needs could change significantly. The conclusion that we expect to meet our funding needs for at least the next 12 months as described above does not take into account: any significant acquisition transactions or the pursuit of any significant new business opportunities or spectrum acquisition strategies; potential material purchases or redemptions of our outstanding debt securities for cash; and potential material increases in the cost of compliance with regulatory mandates. Any of these events or circumstances could involve significant additional funding needs in excess of anticipated cash flows from operating activities and the identified currently available funding sources, including existing cash and cash equivalents on hand and borrowings available under our existing revolving credit facility. If existing capital resources are not sufficient to meet these funding needs, it would be necessary to raise additional capital to meet those needs. Our ability to fund our capital needs from outside sources is ultimately affected by the overall capacity and terms of the banking and securities markets. Given our recent financial performance as well as the volatility in these markets, we continue to monitor them closely and to take steps to maintain financial flexibility and a reasonable cost of capital. We have in the past and may in the future have discussions with third parties regarding potential sources of new capital to satisfy actual or anticipated financing needs. At present, we have no legally binding commitments or understandings with any third parties to obtain any material amount of additional capital. The above discussion is subject to the risks and other cautionary and qualifying factors set forth under Forward Looking Statements and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in this report. 59 Table of Contents Future Contractual Obligations The following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments for our most significant contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008. The information in the table reflects future unconditional payments and is based upon, among other things, the terms of the relevant agreements, appropriate classification of items under generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, currently in effect and certain assumptions, such as future interest rates. Future events, including additional purchases of our securities and refinancing of those securities, could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts. See Forward Looking Statements. Future Contractual Obligations Total 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 andthereafter (in millions) Senior notes, bank credit facilities and debentures(1) $ 33,812 $ 1,999 $ 3,717 $ 2,869 $ 3,801 $ 2,417 $ 19,009 Capital leases and financing obligation(2) 1,964 86 83 77 79 82 1,557 Operating leases(3) 17,878 1,732 1,741 1,595 1,469 1,338 10,003 Purchase orders and other commitments(4) 10,548 6,315 1,816 974 663 519 261 Total $ 64,202 $ 10,132 $ 7,357 $ 5,515 $ 6,012 $ 4,356 $ 30,830 (1) Includes principal and estimated interest payments. Interest payments are based on managements expectations for future interest rates. (2) Represents capital lease payments including interest and the TowerCo financing obligation. (3) Includes future lease costs related to cell and switch sites, real estate, network equipment and office space. (4) Includes service, spectrum, network capacity and other executory contracts. Excludes blanket purchase orders in the amount of $536 million. See below for further discussion. Purchase orders and other commitments include minimum purchases we commit to purchase from suppliers over time and or the unconditional purchase obligations where we guarantee to make a minimum payment to suppliers for goods and services regardless of whether suppliers fully deliver them. They include agreements for access and backhaul and customer billing services, advertising services and contracts related to information technology and customer care outsourcing arrangements. Amounts actually paid under some of these other agreements will likely be higher due to variable components of these agreements. The more significant variable components that determine the ultimate obligation owed include hours contracted, subscribers and other factors. In addition, we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and create an obligation to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the delivery of functioning software or products. Because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements, no such amounts have been included in the table above. The table above also excludes about $536 million of blanket purchase order amounts since their agreement terms are not specified. No time frame is set for these purchase orders and they are not legally binding. As a result, they are not firm commitments. The table above does not include remaining costs to be paid in connection with the fulfillment of our obligation under the Report and Order. The Report and Order requires us to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury at the conclusion of the band reconfiguration process to the extent that the value of the 1.9 GHz spectrum we received exceeds the total of the value of licenses for spectrum in the 700 MHz and 800 MHz bands that we surrendered under the decision plus the actual costs, or qualifying costs, that we incur to retune incumbents and our own facilities. The total minimum cash obligation for the Report and Order is $2.8 billion. From the inception of the program through December 31, 2008, we have incurred approximately $1.8 billion of costs directly attributable to the spectrum reconfiguration program. This amount does not include any of our internal network costs that we have preliminarily allocated to the reconfiguration program for capacity sites and modifications for which we may request credit under the reconfiguration program. We estimate, based on our 60 Table of Contents experience to date with the reconfiguration program and on information currently available, that our total direct costs attributable to complete the spectrum reconfigurations will range between $3.2 and $3.6 billion. Accordingly, we believe that it is unlikely that we will be required to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury. Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $449 million as of December 31, 2008. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the timing of the resolution of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular years in the table. Off Balance Sheet Financing We do not participate in, or secure, financings for any unconsolidated, special purpose entities. Financial Strategies General Risk Management Policies We primarily use derivative instruments for hedging and risk management purposes. Hedging activities may be done for various purposes, including, but not limited to, mitigating the risks associated with an asset, liability, committed transaction or probable forecasted transaction. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through stringent credit approval and review processes, credit support agreements, continual review and monitoring of all counterparties, and thorough legal review of contracts. We also control exposure to market risk by regularly monitoring changes in hedge positions under normal and stress conditions to ensure they do not exceed established limits. Our board of directors has adopted a financial risk management policy that authorizes us to enter into derivative transactions, and all transactions comply with the policy. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes with the exception of equity rights obtained in connection with commercial agreements or strategic investments, usually in the form of warrants to purchase common shares. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are primarily exposed to the market risk associated with unfavorable movements in interest rates, foreign currencies, and equity prices. The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors. Interest Rate Risk The communications industry is a capital intensive, technology driven business. We are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our borrowings. Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows. Specific interest rate risk includes: the risk of increasing interest rates on floating rate debt and the risk of increasing interest rates for planned new fixed rate long term financings or refinancings. Cash Flow Hedges We periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges to reduce the impact of interest rate movements on future interest expense by effectively converting a portion of our floating rate debt to a fixed rate. As of December 31, 2008, we had no outstanding interest rate cash flow hedges. 61 Table of Contents Fair Value Hedges We periodically enter into interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate movements and achieve an optimal mixture of floating and fixed rate debt while minimizing liquidity risk. The interest rate swap agreements designated as fair value hedges effectively convert our fixed rate debt to a floating rate by receiving fixed rate amounts in exchange for floating rate interest payments over the life of the agreement without an exchange of the underlying principal amount. As of December 31, 2008, we had no outstanding interest rate fair value hedges. About 85% of our debt as of December 31, 2008 was fixed rate debt. While changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt, there is no impact to earnings and cash flows because we intend to hold these obligations to maturity unless market and other conditions are favorable. We perform interest rate sensitivity analyses on our variable rate debt. These analyses indicate that a one percentage point change in interest rates would have an annual pre tax impact of $29.1 million on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2008. We also perform a sensitivity analysis on the fair market value of our outstanding debt. A 10% decline in market interest rates would cause a $979 million increase in the fair market value of our debt to $15.4 billion. Foreign Currency Risk We also enter into forward contracts and options in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Our foreign exchange risk management program focuses on reducing transaction exposure to optimize consolidated cash flow. We use foreign currency derivatives to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to settlement of international telecommunications access charges and the operation of our international subsidiaries. The dollar equivalent of our net foreign currency payables from international settlements was $4 million and the net foreign currency receivables from international operations was $6 million as of December 31, 2008. The potential immediate pre tax loss to us that would result from a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates based on these positions would be insignificant. Equity Risk We are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments. We invest in equity instruments of public and private companies for operational and strategic business purposes. These securities are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to volatility of the stock market and industries in which the companies operate. These securities, which are classified in investments and marketable securities on the consolidated balance sheets, include equity method investments, such as our investment in Clearwire, investments in private securities, available for sale securities and equity derivative instruments. Additional information regarding our derivative instruments can be found in note 10 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. In certain business transactions, we are granted warrants to purchase the securities of other companies at fixed rates. These warrants are supplemental to the terms of the business transaction and are not designated as hedging instruments.
