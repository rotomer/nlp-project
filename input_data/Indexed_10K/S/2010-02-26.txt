Selected Financial Data The 2009, 2008, 2007 and 2006 data presented below is not comparable to that of the prior periods primarily as a result of the August 2005 Sprint Nextel merger and the subsequent Nextel Partners, Inc., Virgin Mobile USA, Inc. and PCS Affiliate acquisitions, as well as our November 2008 contribution of our next generation wireless network to Clearwire. The acquired companies results of operations subsequent to their acquisition dates are included in our consolidated financial statements. Embarq Corporation, our former local segment, which was spun off in 2006, is shown as discontinued operations for all periods prior to the spin off. We lost approximately 1.0 million retail wireless subscribers in 2009, 5.1 million in 2008 and 658,000 in 2007, which caused the majority of the reduction in net operating revenues in those periods.

Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Business Strategies and Key Priorities Sprint is a communications company offering a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications products and services that are designed to meet the needs of individual consumers, businesses, government subscribers and resellers. The communications industry has been and will continue to be highly competitive on the basis of price, the types of services and devices offered and the quality of service. As discussed below in Effects on our Wireless Business of Post paid Subscriber Losses, the Company has experienced significant losses of subscribers in the critical post paid wireless market and is currently focused on specific steps to reduce such losses. Our business strategy is to be responsive to changing consumer mobility demands by being innovative and differentiated in the marketplace. Significant steps in positioning ourselves for 2010 include our fourth quarter 2009 investment agreement with Clearwire to contribute an additional $1.176 billion increasing our ownership percentage to 56% as of December 31, 2009 and enhancing Clearwires ability to further its 4G network buildout; and the fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions of Virgin Mobile USA, Inc. (VMU) allowing us to broaden our product offerings in the prepaid wireless market and iPCS, Inc. (iPCS) to expand our direct subscriber base, grow our direct coverage area and simplify our business operations. Our future growth plans and strategy revolve around the following key priorities: Improve the customer experience; Strengthen the Sprint brand; and Generate operating cash flow. Our Sprint brand stands for Simplicity, Productivity and Value by making it affordable to do more than just talk. We have reduced confusion over pricing plans and complex bills with our Simply Everything and Everything Data plans and our Any Mobile AnytimeSM feature that offer savings compared to our competition. In addition to savings offered to consumers, new Business Advantage pricing plans are available to our business subscribers who can also take advantage of Any Mobile, AnytimeSM with certain plans. To simplify and improve the customer experience, we have introduced tools such as Sprint&reg; One Click that allows subscribers to access various software applications through a single click on their mobile devices and Ready Now which trains our subscribers before they leave the store on how to use their mobile devices. For our business subscribers, we aim to increase their productivity by helping them upgrade from older, less flexible network technologies to IP and by providing differentiated services that utilize the advantages of combining IP networks with wireless technology. This differentiation enables us to acquire and retain both wireline only and combined wireline wireless subscribers on our networks. Consistent with the changing economic environment, our prepaid plans, primarily through the National Boost Monthly Unlimited, Virgin Mobile and Assurance Wireless offerings, are experiencing strong demand as our simple, no long term contract solutions provide good service and value. We plan to continue to grow our position in the prepaid market by tailoring our products and services to target markets while leveraging our Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile and Assurance Wireless brands through new and existing distribution channels. Sprint has refocused its wholesale business as a reseller of new converged services that leverage the Sprint network but are sold under the customers brand. We have adopted new pricing models, made it easier for our customers to acquire access and resell our services by bundling wireless and wireline services and focused our attention to partners with existing distribution channels. In addition, we have strengthened our sales efforts and expanded to new markets in the rapidly growing machine to machine space. 29 Table of Contents In addition to our customer oriented goals, we have also taken steps to generate operating cash flow and reduce our cost structure to align with the reduced revenues from fewer post paid subscribers. Our actions include workforce reductions in 2009, which are expected to reduce labor and other costs by approximately $1.5 billion annually. We believe these actions, as well as our continued efforts to reduce other operating expenses and non essential capital spending, will allow us to maintain a strong cash position, although we do not expect that these measures will fully offset the decline in cash provided by operating activities expected because of our lower number of post paid subscribers as discussed below in Effects on our Wireless Business of Post paid Subscriber Losses. Effects on our Wireless Business of Post paid Subscriber Losses The following table shows annual net additions (losses) of post paid subscribers for the past five years, excluding subscribers obtained through business combinations. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 ( in thousands) Total net additions (losses) of post paid subscribers (3,546 ) (4,073 ) (1,224 ) 279 2,194 As shown by the table below under Results of Operations, Wireless segment earnings represent more than 80% of Sprints total consolidated segment earnings. Within the Wireless segment, post paid wireless voice and data services represent the most significant contributors to earnings and are driven by the number of post paid subscribers to our services, as well as the average revenue per subscriber or user (ARPU). Beginning in mid 2006, Sprint began to experience net losses of post paid subscribers on the iDEN wireless network, which we acquired in 2005 in the Sprint Nextel merger. Such net losses for the year ended December 31, 2007 exceeded the net additions of post paid subscribers on our CDMA wireless network. Beginning in 2008 and continuing through 2009, we have been experiencing net losses of post paid subscribers on each of the iDEN and CDMA wireless networks, excluding migration of subscribers between networks. We believe that these significant net post paid subscriber losses resulted from a number of historical factors, in addition to the competitive nature of the industry, including: 1) uncertainty in the marketplace as to our commitment to the iDEN network; 2) a high level of involuntary churn during 2007 and early 2008 due to a relatively high mix of sub prime credit subscribers; 3) adverse perceptions among some of our subscribers about our customer care services; 4) adverse perceptions among some of our subscribers about the quality of and our commitment to development of our networks; 5) successful competitor devices; 6) perception in the marketplace that the portfolio of Sprint device offerings was not as desirable as those of some competitors; 7) uncertainty about the financial strength and future reliability of Sprint; and 8) perceptions in the marketplace, in part as a result of the subscriber losses themselves, as well as the other factors above, that reduced the Sprint brands effectiveness in attracting and retaining subscribers. Beginning in 2008, in conjunction with changes in senior management, Sprint undertook steps to address each of these factors. Before directly addressing brand perception, steps were taken to improve the quality of Sprints customer care services and the Sprint networks, as confirmed by recent independent comparisons with competitors. Steps were also taken to improve the credit quality mix of our subscriber base and to improve our financial stability, including vigorous cost control actions, which have resulted in our continuing strong cash flow from operations. We also improved financial flexibility through renegotiation in 2008 of our revolving bank credit facility. In addition, beginning in 2008 and continuing in 2009, we have undertaken increased marketing initiatives, to increase market awareness of the improvements that have been achieved in the customer experience, including the speed and dependability of our network. We have also introduced new devices improving our overall lineup and providing a competitive mix for customer selection, as well as competitive new rate plans providing simplicity and value. 30 Table of Contents We expect these actions will have a favorable impact on net subscriber losses. Net post paid subscriber losses had not improved sustainably through the first quarter of 2009, in part due to circumstances in the general economy, including higher deactivations of business customer accounts as companies reduced wireless service lines resulting from their own workforce reductions. However, during 2009, the Company began to see improvement in our net loss of post paid subscribers. Net post paid subscriber losses decreased by approximately 20% sequentially for each of the quarters ended June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009 and by approximately 35% sequentially for the quarter ended December 31, 2009. Net post paid subscriber losses during the six months ended December 31, 2009 decreased by more than 40% compared to the same period in the prior year. As discussed below under Wireless Business Service Revenue, the net loss of post paid subscribers in 2009 can be expected to cause wireless service revenue in 2010 to be approximately $2.1 billion lower. If we continue to experience similar losses of post paid subscribers in 2010, it would have a significant negative impact on Sprints financial condition, results of operations and liquidity in 2010 and beyond. During 2009, wireless industry trends have included a significant industry wide shift for new accounts from post paid wireless accounts to prepaid accounts. Sprints successful prepaid wireless offerings, as well as the cost controls that have been implemented, will partially offset the effects of net post paid subscriber losses, but are unlikely to be sufficient to sustain the Companys level of profitability and cash flows unless we are successful in further reducing the decline in post paid subscribers. The Company believes the actions that have been taken, as described above, and that continue to be taken in marketing, customer service, device offerings, and network quality, should reduce the number of net post paid and total subscriber losses for 2010 as compared to 2009. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008(1) 2007 (in millions) Wireless segment earnings $ 5,198 $ 6,776 $ 9,914 Wireline segment earnings 1,221 1,175 1,074 Corporate, other and eliminations (12 ) (287 ) (188 ) Consolidated segment earnings 6,407 7,664 10,800 Depreciation and amortization (7,416 ) (8,407 ) (8,933 ) Goodwill impairment (963 ) (29,649 ) Merger and integration expenses (130 ) (516 ) Other, net (389 ) (806 ) (442 ) Operating loss (1,398 ) (2,642 ) (28,740 ) Interest expense (1,450 ) (1,362 ) (1,433 ) Equity in losses of unconsolidated investments, net (803 ) (145 ) (3 ) Other income, net 157 89 401 Income tax benefit 1,058 1,264 331 Net loss $ (2,436 ) $ (2,796 ) $ (29,444 ) (1) Consolidated results of operations include the results of our next generation wireless broadband network, which was contributed to Clearwire in a transaction that closed on November 28, 2008. Consolidated segment earnings decreased $1.26 billion, or 16%, in 2009 compared to 2008 and $3.14 billion, or 29%, in 2008 compared to 2007. Consolidated segment earnings consist of our Wireless and Wireline segments, which are discussed below, and Corporate, other and eliminations. Corporate, other and eliminations improved $275 million for 2009 compared to 2008 and declined $99 million for 2008 compared to 2007 primarily as a result of costs incurred related to the build up of WiMAX from 2007 to 2008 that are no longer being incurred in 2009 due to the close of the transaction with Clearwire in late 2008. 31 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation expense decreased $137 million, or 2%, in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to reduced capital expenditures in 2009 as compared to 2008 and increased $343 million, or 6%, in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increases of in service network assets. Amortization expense declined $854 million, or 35%, in 2009 compared to 2008 and $869 million, or 26%, in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily due to the amortization of the customer relationships acquired as part of the Sprint Nextel merger, which are amortized using the sum of the years digits method, resulting in higher amortization rates in early periods that decline over time. Goodwill Impairment The Company recognized non cash goodwill impairments of $963 million and $29.649 billion during 2008 and 2007, respectively. The impaired goodwill was primarily attributable to the Companys acquisition of Nextel in 2005 and reflects the reduction in estimated fair value of Sprints wireless reporting unit subsequent to the acquisition resulting from, among other factors, net losses of post paid subscribers. Merger and Integration Expenses Merger and integration expenses related to business combinations prior to 2008 were generally classified as selling, general and administrative and cost of products as appropriate on the consolidated statement of operations. Those not solely and directly attributable to the Wireless segment were included in Corporate, other and eliminations and were classified as selling, general and administrative expenses. Merger and integration expenses decreased $130 million, or 100%, in 2009 compared to 2008 and $386 million, or 75%, in 2008 as compared to 2007 as we did not incur these costs in the second half of 2008. Other, net The following table provides additional information of items included in Other, net for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Severance and exit costs $ (400 ) $ (355 ) $ (277 ) Asset impairments (47 ) (480 ) (163 ) Gains from asset dispositions and exchanges 68 29 Other (10 ) (2 ) Total $ (389 ) $ (806 ) $ (442 ) Other, net expenses decreased $417 million, or 52%, in 2009 compared to 2008 and increased $364 million, or 82%, in 2008 compared to 2007. Severance and exit costs increased by $45 million, or 13%, in 2009 compared to 2008 and $78 million, or 28%, in 2008 compared to 2007 due to separation of employees and continued organizational realignment initiatives aimed at reducing our cost structure to align with reduced revenues from net subscriber losses. Asset impairments decreased by $433 million, or 90%, in 2009 compared to 2008 and increased $317 million, or 194%, in 2008 compared to 2007. Asset impairments in 2009 primarily related to network asset equipment no longer necessary for managements strategic plans and, in addition, in 2008 also related to cell site development costs no longer necessary for managements strategic plans. During 2007, asset impairments related to the write off of network assets, including site development costs, the loss on the sale of Velocita Wireless, and the closing of retail stores due to integration activities. Gains from asset dispositions and exchanges increased by $39 million, or 134%, in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to spectrum exchange transactions. 32 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense increased $88 million, or 7%, in 2009 as compared to 2008, as fewer capital projects led to a decrease of $111 million of capitalized interest partially offset by a decrease of $56 million related to a $1.5 billion decline in the weighted average long term debt balance between the comparative periods. In addition, we had $35 million of interest credits in 2008 related to the reversal of accrued interest due to the completion of income tax audits. Interest expense decreased $71 million in 2008 as compared to 2007, due to the reduction in our average effective interest rates, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average long term debt balance. The effective interest rate on the weighted average long term debt balance of $21.4 billion, $22.9 billion and $21.8 billion was 6.8%, 6.6% and 6.9% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information on the Companys financing activities. Equity in Losses of Unconsolidated Investments, net This item consists mainly of our proportionate share of earnings or losses from our equity method investments. Equity losses of $649 million associated with the investment in Clearwire represent the Companys proportionate share of Clearwires net loss for 2009, plus a pre tax loss of $154 million ($96 million after tax) related to the dilution of our investment in Clearwire from 53% to 51% during the first quarter 2009. During the fourth quarter 2009, we invested approximately $1.1 billion in Clearwire which increased our economic ownership to 56%. Prospectively, from the date of this subsequent investment, our equity income (loss) from Clearwire will represent our proportionate share of Clearwires results of operations based on our increased economic interest. We expect Clearwire to continue to generate a net loss as it continues build out of its 4G network. Other income, net The following table provides additional information of items included in Other income, net for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Interest income $ 34 $ 97 $ 151 Realized gain (loss) from investments (29 ) (24 ) 253 Gain from non controlling interest in VMU 151 Other 1 16 (3 ) Total $ 157 $ 89 $ 401 Interest income decreased $63 million, or 65%, in 2009 as compared to 2008, primarily due to lower interest rates. Interest income decreased $54 million, or 36%, in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily due to lower interest rates and the recognition of interest income on income tax settlements of $31 million in 2007. A realized gain of $253 million was recognized in 2007, primarily related to the sale of a portion of our equity interest in VMU and a dilution of our ownership percentage to 14.1% in conjunction with their initial public offering of stock. As a result of the fourth quarter 2009 acquisition of VMU, a non cash gain of $151 million ($92 million after tax) was recognized related to the estimated fair value over net carrying value of our previously held non controlling interest in VMU. Income Tax Benefit As a result of our pre tax losses, the consolidated effective tax rate was a benefit of approximately 30%, 31% and 1% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2009 effective tax rate was reduced by a $281 million net increase to the valuation allowance for federal and state deferred tax assets related to net operating and capital loss carryforwards. The 2008 and 2007 effective tax rates were reduced by $794 million of the $963 million non cash goodwill impairment in 2008 and $29.3 billion of the $29.6 billion non cash goodwill impairment in 2007 as substantially all of the charges are not separately deductible for tax purposes. Additional information related to items impacting the effective tax rates can be found in note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 33 Table of Contents Segment Earnings Wireless Business Wireless segment earnings are primarily a function of wireless service revenue, costs to acquire subscribers, network and interconnection costs to serve those subscribers and other Wireless segment operating expenses. The costs to acquire our subscribers include our equipment cost in excess of the price at which we sell our devices, referred to as equipment net subsidies, as well as the marketing and sales costs incurred to attract those subscribers. Network costs primarily represent switch and cell site costs and interconnection costs, which generally consist of per minute usage fees and roaming fees paid to other carriers. The remaining costs associated with operating the Wireless segment include the costs to operate our customer care organization and administrative support. Wireless service revenue, costs to acquire subscribers, and variable network and interconnection costs fluctuate with the changes in our subscriber base and their related usage, but some cost elements do not fluctuate in the short term with the changes in our subscriber usage. The following table provides an overview of the results of operations of our Wireless segment for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Year Ended December 31, Wireless Earnings 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Post paid $ 23,205 $ 25,994 $ 29,454 Prepaid 2,081 1,498 1,590 Retail service revenue 25,286 27,492 31,044 Wholesale, affiliate and other revenue 546 943 1,061 Total service revenue 25,832 28,435 32,105 Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) (8,384 ) (8,745 ) (8,612 ) Service gross margin 17,448 19,690 23,493 Service gross margin percentage 68 % 69 % 73 % Equipment revenue 1,954 1,992 2,595 Cost of products (5,545 ) (4,859 ) (5,023 ) Equipment net subsidy (3,591 ) (2,867 ) (2,428 ) Equipment net subsidy percentage (184 )% (144 )% (94 )% Selling, general and administrative expense (8,659 ) (10,047 ) (11,151 ) Wireless segment earnings $ 5,198 $ 6,776 $ 9,914 Service Revenue Our Wireless segment generates revenues from the sale of wireless services, the sale of wireless devices and accessories and the sale of wholesale and other services. Service revenue consists of fixed monthly recurring charges, variable usage charges and miscellaneous fees such as activation fees, directory assistance, roaming, equipment protection, late payment and early termination charges and certain regulatory related fees, net of service credits. The ability of our Wireless segment to generate service revenues is primarily a function of: revenue generated from each subscriber, which in turn is a function of the types and amount of services utilized by each subscriber and the rates charged for those services; and the number of subscribers that we serve, which in turn is a function of our ability to acquire new and retain existing subscribers. 34 Table of Contents The table below summarizes average number of retail subscribers and average revenue per subscriber for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Retail comprises those subscribers to whom Sprint directly provides wireless services on our networks, whether those services are provided on a prepaid or a post paid basis. Wholesale and affiliates are those subscribers who are served through MVNO and affiliate relationships, and other arrangements through which wireless services are sold by Sprint to other companies that resell those services to their subscribers. More information about the number of subscribers, net additions to subscribers, and average rates of monthly post paid and prepaid customer churn for each quarter since the first quarter 2007 may be found in the table on page 37. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (subscribers in thousands) Average post paid subscribers(1) 34,640 38,752 41,454 Average prepaid subscribers(1) 5,313 4,135 4,391 Average monthly service revenue per subscriber: Post paid $ 56 $ 56 $ 59 Prepaid 33 30 30 Average retail 53 53 56 (1) Average subscribers include subscribers acquired through business combinations prospectively from the date of acquisition. Average subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2009 are inclusive of 4,539,000 prepaid subscribers and 835,000 post paid subscribers acquired through our 2009 business combinations which were previously included with wholesale and affiliate subscribers. Average subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2007 are inclusive of 170,000 subscribers acquired through our 2007 business combination. Retail service revenue decreased $2.2 billion, or 8%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 and $3.6 billion, or 11% in 2008 as compared to 2007. The majority of the decline is due to a $2.8 billion and $3.5 billion decrease in post paid service revenue driven by a reduction in the Companys average number of post paid subscribers of approximately 4.1 million and 2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decline in post paid service revenue was partially offset by an increase of $583 million in prepaid revenue for 2009 as compared to 2008, primarily driven by attracting subscribers to the Companys National Boost Monthly Unlimited plan, which launched in the first quarter of 2009. Prepaid revenue for 2008 decreased $92 million as compared to 2007, primarily driven by a reduction of 256,000 in the average number of retail prepaid subscribers, primarily on the iDEN network. Wholesale, affiliate and other revenues, in total, decreased $397 million, or 42%, for 2009 as compared to 2008, and $118 million, or 11%, for 2008 as compared to 2007. The decrease in 2009 was primarily due to a decrease in the number of subscribers with two of our large MVNO operators. Wholesale revenues include a growing number of devices under our open device initiative, including machine to machine services through devices that utilize our network. Average revenue per subscriber for our open device machine to machine services is significantly lower than revenue from other wholesale and affiliate subscribers; however, the cost to service these customers is also lower resulting in a higher profit margin as a percent of revenue. The decrease in 2008 was primarily due to a decline in average monthly service revenue per wholesale subscriber. 35 Table of Contents Average Monthly Service Revenue per Subscriber Below is a table showing average revenue per retail post paid and prepaid subscriber for the past twelve quarters.

Changes in average monthly service revenue reflect subscribers who change rate plans, the level of voice and data usage during a quarter, the amount of service credits which are offered to subscribers, plus the net effect of average monthly revenue generated by new subscribers and deactivating subscribers. Average monthly post paid service revenue per subscriber was stable throughout 2008 and most of 2009 as a result of improved retention of higher revenue subscribers on bundled rate plans offset by lower overage and roaming revenues. During the fourth quarter 2009, the Company experienced a decline in average monthly post paid service revenue per subscriber due to declines in overage revenues resulting from the increased popularity of fixed rate bundled plans including the Any Mobile Anytime feature. The decline in average monthly retail post paid service revenue per subscriber in 2007 was due to the loss of iDEN subscribers with higher priced service plans and the migration of iDEN subscribers to lower priced plans. Our average monthly service revenue per subscriber in 2007 also declined due to other reasons, the most significant of which is the number of service credits accepted by our subscribers on both networks, which increased due to our retention efforts. Average monthly prepaid service revenue per subscriber increased during 2009 as compared to 2008 due to higher revenue from our National Boost Monthly Unlimited users combined with more stable average revenue per subscriber from our traditional prepaid users. During the fourth quarter 2009, average monthly prepaid service revenue per subscriber was reduced by the addition of Virgin Mobile subscribers which carry a lower average revenue per subscriber compared to Sprints other prepaid subscribers. Net Additions to (Losses of) Subscribers The wireless industry is subject to intense competition to acquire and retain subscribers of wireless services. Most markets in which we operate have high rates of penetration for wireless services. Wireless carriers accordingly must attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from competitors rather than from first time subscribers. As a result, wireless carriers have focused on retaining valued subscribers through various means including considerable efforts in customer care. Our retention efforts have been focused on improving the customer experience, including, but not limited to, our Simply Everything bundled plans that provide unlimited voice, data, text and Nextel Direct Connect&reg; services; improved service levels from our customer care centers; and our Ready Now program. As discussed above in Overview, we have endeavored to retain and attract subscribers by taking actions to improve our customer care, sales and distribution functions, and brand awareness. In addition, we have taken other actions in an effort to improve our subscribers experience including improving our network performance by adding capacity to our networks, broadening our device portfolio, and providing subscribers an excellent value proposition with our Simply Everything&reg; pricing plans and our Everything Data plans which include our new Any Mobile, AnytimeSM feature. While certain indicators suggest that we are making progress with respect to these actions, we have continued to lose valuable post paid wireless subscribers. 36 Table of Contents The following table shows (a) net additions (losses) of wireless subscribers for the past twelve quarters, excluding subscribers obtained through business combinations, existing subscribers who have migrated between networks (b) our total subscribers as of the end of each quarterly period, and (c) our average rates of monthly post paid and prepaid customer churn for the past twelve quarters. Quarter Ended March 31,2007 June 30,2007 September 30,2007 December 31,2007 March 31,2008 June 30,2008 September 30,2008 December 31,2008 March 31,2009 June 30,2009 September 30,2009 December 31,2009 Net additions (losses) (in thousands) Post paid: iDEN (744 ) (662 ) (700 ) (686 ) (684 ) (527 ) (589 ) (639 ) (625 ) (529 ) (466 ) (414 ) CDMA(1) 524 678 363 3 (386 ) (249 ) (533 ) (466 ) (625 ) (462 ) (335 ) (90 ) Total retail post paid (220 ) 16 (337 ) (683 ) (1,070 ) (776 ) (1,122 ) (1,105 ) (1,250 ) (991 ) (801 ) (504 ) Prepaid: iDEN 272 70 (57 ) (202 ) (543 ) (250 ) (305 ) (264 ) 764 938 801 483 CDMA 3 99 124 257 343 112 (24 ) (50 ) (90 ) (161 ) (135 ) (48 ) Total retail prepaid 275 169 67 55 (200 ) (138 ) (329 ) (314 ) 674 777 666 435 Wholesale and affiliates 513 188 210 520 183 13 130 146 394 (43 ) (410 ) (79 ) End of period subscribers (in thousands) Post paid: iDEN 16,535 15,472 14,355 13,246 12,179 11,330 10,466 9,609 8,890 8,292 7,762 7,255 CDMA(1) 25,050 26,129 27,079 27,505 27,502 27,575 27,317 27,069 26,538 26,145 25,874 26,712 Total retail post paid(3) 41,585 41,601 41,434 40,751 39,681 38,905 37,783 36,678 35,428 34,437 33,636 33,967 Prepaid: iDEN 4,284 4,354 4,297 4,095 3,552 3,302 2,997 2,733 3,497 4,435 5,236 5,719 CDMA 3 102 226 483 826 938 914 864 774 613 478 4,969 Total retail prepaid(3) 4,287 4,456 4,523 4,578 4,378 4,240 3,911 3,597 4,271 5,048 5,714 10,688 Wholesale and affiliates(3) 6,825 6,980 7,175 7,676 7,841 7,831 7,939 8,063 9,384 9,341 8,931 3,478 Monthly customer churn rate(2) Retail post paid 2.30 % 2.03 % 2.30 % 2.29 % 2.45 % 1.98 % 2.15 % 2.16 % 2.25 % 2.05 % 2.17 % 2.11 % Retail prepaid 6.97 % 6.76 % 6.15 % 7.47 % 9.93 % 7.36 % 8.16 % 8.20 % 6.86 % 6.38 % 6.65 % 5.56 % (1) Includes subscribers with PowerSource devices, which operate seamlessly between our CDMA and iDEN networks. (2) Churn is calculated by dividing net subscriber deactivations for the quarter by the sum of the average number of subscribers for each month in the quarter. For post paid accounts comprising multiple subscribers, such as family plans and enterprise accounts, net deactivations are defined as deactivations in excess of customer activations in a particular account within 30 days. Post paid and Prepaid churn consists of both voluntary churn, where the subscriber makes his or her own determination to cease being a customer, and involuntary churn, where the customers service is terminated due to a lack of payment or other reasons. (3) Reflects the transfer of 170,000 subscribers from Wholesale and affiliates to Post paid due to a business combination in the quarter ended September 30, 2007 as well as the transfer of 4,539,000 Prepaid and 835,000 Post paid subscribers from Wholesale and affiliates as a result of the business combinations completed in the fourth quarter 2009. 37 Table of Contents Retail Post Paid Subscribers We lost 3.5 million net post paid subscribers during 2009 as compared to losing 4.1 million and 1.2 million net post paid subscribers during 2008 and 2007, respectively. The following table provides a reconciliation of reported net additions (losses) of retail post paid subscribers and transfers of subscribers between network technologies during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. CDMA Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in thousands) Reported net additions (losses) (1,512 ) (1,634 ) 1,568 Net transfers from iDEN 321 1,199 1,563 Additions (losses) after transfers from iDEN (1,191 ) (435 ) 3,131 iDEN Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in thousands) Reported net losses (2,034 ) (2,439 ) (2,792 ) Net transfers to CDMA (321 ) (1,199 ) (1,563 ) Losses after transfers to CDMA (2,355 ) (3,638 ) (4,355 ) The Company expects that both post paid and total subscriber full year net losses should improve for the year 2010 as compared to 2009. However, our actual loss of post paid subscribers in 2009 can be expected to cause wireless service revenue in 2010 to be approximately $2.1 billion lower than it would have been had those subscribers not been lost. If we continue to experience significant loss of post paid subscribers in 2010, it would have a significant negative impact on Sprints financial condition, results of operations and liquidity in 2010 and beyond. Prepaid Subscribers We added approximately 2.6 million net prepaid subscribers during 2009 as compared to losing 981,000 and adding 566,000 net prepaid subscribers in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our net prepaid subscriber additions in 2009 were principally driven by the Companys National Boost Monthly Unlimited offering on the iDEN network which was launched in the first quarter 2009. The success achieved by the National Boost Monthly Unlimited offering has driven a significant prepaid market share gain. In conjunction with the changing economic environment, the Companys National Boost Monthly Unlimited offering continues to experience strong demand as prepaid decisions are becoming a larger portion of overall decisions in the marketplace. Net prepaid subscriber losses in 2008 as compared to net additions in 2007 were principally caused by our attracting fewer new subscribers on the iDEN network and total deactivations increasing year over year. End of period prepaid subscribers include subscribers engaged in certain retention programs that target qualifying subscribers to maintain ongoing service while providing additional time to make a replenishment prior to account deactivation. Subscribers targeted through retention programs are not included in the calculation of churn until their offer expires without a replenishment to their account. Wholesale and Affiliate Subscribers Wholesale and affiliate subscribers represent customers that are served on our networks through companies that resell our services to their subscribers, customers residing in PCS Affiliate territories and a growing portion of subscribers from our open device initiative primarily representing machine to machine devices that utilize our network. During 2009, wholesale and affiliate subscriber losses were 138,000, compared to net subscriber additions of 472,000 and 1.4 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Subscriber losses in 2009 were primarily due to a decrease in the number of subscribers with two of our large MVNO operators. 38 Table of Contents Cost of Services Cost of services consists primarily of: costs to operate and maintain our CDMA and iDEN networks, including direct switch and cell site costs, such as rent, utilities, maintenance, payroll costs associated with network employees and spectrum frequency leasing costs; fixed and variable interconnection costs, the fixed component of which consists of monthly flat rate fees for facilities leased from local exchange carriers based on the number of cell sites and switches in service in a particular period and the related equipment installed at each site, and the variable component of which generally consists of per minute use fees charged by wireline providers for calls terminating on their networks, which fluctuate in relation to the level and duration of those terminating calls; long distance costs paid to the Wireline segment; costs to service and repair devices; regulatory fees; roaming fees paid to other carriers; and fixed and variable costs relating to payments to third parties for the use of their proprietary data applications, such as messaging, music, TV and navigation services by our subscribers. Cost of services decreased $361 million, or 4%, in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily reflecting a decline in labor, outside services and maintenance costs consistent with the Companys cost cutting efforts, as well as a decline in network costs associated with fewer subscribers. Cost of services increased $133 million, or 2%, in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily reflecting increased costs relating to data and voice roaming outside of our networks and increased service and repair costs related to devices with increased functionality. In addition, backhaul costs, including usage of our wireline network, have increased primarily due to increased data usage by our subscribers and the expansion of EV DO Rev. A in our network. These costs have been slightly offset by lower employee related and outside services costs. Equipment Net Subsidy We recognize equipment revenue and corresponding costs of devices when title of the device passes to the dealer or end user customer. Our marketing plans assume that devices typically will be sold at prices below cost, which is consistent with industry practice, as subscriber retention efforts often include providing incentives to subscribers such as offering new devices at discounted prices. We reduce equipment revenue for these discounts offered directly to the customer, or for certain payments to third party dealers to reimburse the dealer for point of sale discounts that are offered to the end user subscriber. Additionally, the cost of devices is reduced by any rebates that are earned from the supplier. Cost of devices and accessories also includes order fulfillment related expenses and write downs of device and related accessory inventory for shrinkage and obsolescence. Equipment costs in excess of the revenues generated from equipment sales is referred to in the industry as equipment net subsidy. Equipment revenue decreased $38 million, or 2%, in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to declining average sales prices for those devices as a result of competitive and economic pressures, partially offset by an increase in the number of devices sold in 2009 as compared to 2008. Equipment revenue decreased $603 million, or 23%, in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a decrease in the number of devices sold in 2008 as compared to 2007, partially offset by an increase in the average sales prices for those devices as customers began to purchase more smartphones. Cost of devices increased $699 million, or 15%, in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to our mix of devices sold reflecting a greater mix of post paid devices sold with a higher functionality and an increase in the number of devices sold. Cost of devices decreased $165 million, or 3%, in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to a decrease in the number of devices sold partially offset by an increase in the average cost per device as our mix of devices sold consisted of a higher percentage of smartphones and higher end devices. 39 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expense Sales and marketing costs primarily consist of customer acquisition costs, including commissions paid to our indirect dealers, third party distributors and retail sales force for new device activations and upgrades, residual payments to our indirect dealers, payroll and facilities costs associated with our retail sales force and stores and marketing employees, advertising, media programs and sponsorships, including costs related to branding. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for billing, customer care and information technology operations, bad debt expense and administrative support activities, including collections, legal, finance, human resources, strategic planning and technology and product development. Sales and marketing expense decreased $273 million, or 6%, in 2009 from 2008 as compared to $722 million, or 13%, in 2008 from 2007. The decline in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 is primarily due to the decline in gross subscriber additions and a decline in labor related costs due to our workforce and cost reduction activities. General and administrative costs decreased $1.1 billion, or 22%, in 2009 from 2008 and $382 million, or 7%, in 2008 from 2007. The decline in general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily due to the decrease in employee related costs as part of our cost cutting initiatives, reduction in customer care costs, and lower bad debt expense. Employee related costs decreased approximately $536 million in 2009 as compared to 2008, due to workforce reductions announced in January and November 2009. Customer care costs decreased $363 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. Bad debt expense was $392 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 representing a $240 million decline, as compared to bad debt expense of $632 million in 2008. The improvement in bad debt expense resulted from lower rates of uncollectibility during the period, as well as lower estimated uncollectible accounts in outstanding accounts receivable. Our improvement in customer care expense is largely attributable to customer care quality initiatives that were launched in 2008. These initiatives resulted in fewer calls per subscriber into customer care which was reduced by 39% from 2007 peak levels. The reduction in calls per subscriber allowed for a reduction of 19 call centers in 2009 and 11 call centers in 2008. We also have several customer care and collection activities designed to proactively contact subscribers to ensure they are on appropriate service plans based on their usage and to negotiate payment arrangements designed to help customers through difficult financial times. As a result, we have experienced a decrease in involuntary churn, as well as a decrease in the number of accounts and average balances written off in 2009 compared to 2008. The decline in general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 was principally due to the decrease in bad debt expense and lower employee related costs, offset by an increase in customer care related costs. Bad debt expense was $632 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to $896 million for 2007 representing a $264 million decline. The improvement in bad debt expense was largely attributable to credit policies for new customers and the customer care quality initiatives launched in 2008. Specifically, the ratio of subscribers with a prime credit score to those with a subprime credit score improved in 2008 as compared to 2007. 40 Table of Contents Segment Earnings Wireline Wireline segment earnings are primarily a function of wireline service revenue, network and interconnection costs and other Wireline segment operating expenses. Network costs primarily represent special access costs and interconnection costs which generally consist of domestic and international per minute usage fees paid to other carriers. The remaining costs associated with operating the Wireline segment include the costs to operate our customer care and billing organizations in addition to administrative support. Wireline service revenue, and variable network and interconnection costs fluctuate with the changes in our customer base and their related usage, but some cost elements do not fluctuate in the short term with the changes in our customer usage. Our Wireline segment provides services to our Wireless segment which are generally accounted for based on market rates which we believe approximate fair value. The following table provides an overview of the results of operations of our Wireline segment for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Year Ended December 31, Wireline Earnings 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Voice $ 2,563 $ 3,079 $ 3,509 Data 662 959 1,210 Internet 2,293 2,148 1,575 Other 111 146 169 Total net service revenue 5,629 6,332 6,463 Cost of services and products (3,663 ) (4,192 ) (4,446 ) Service gross margin 1,966 2,140 2,017 Service gross margin percentage 35 % 34 % 31 % Selling, general and administrative expense (745 ) (965 ) (943 ) Wireline segment earnings $ 1,221 $ 1,175 $ 1,074 Wireline Revenue Voice Revenues Voice revenues decreased $516 million, or 17%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 and decreased $430 million, or 12%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. The 2009 and 2008 decreases were primarily driven by volume declines due to customer churn as well as overall price declines. Voice revenues generated from the sale of services to our Wireless segment represented 31% of total voice revenues in 2009 as compared to 26% in 2008 and 23% in 2007. Data Revenues Data revenues reflect sales of data services, including ATM, frame relay and managed network services. Data revenues decreased $297 million, or 31%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 and decreased $251 million, or 21%, in 2008 as compared to 2007 due to declines in frame relay and ATM services as subscribers migrated to IP based technologies. These declines were partially offset by growth in IP revenues. Data revenues generated from the provision of services to the Wireless segment represented 19% of total data revenue in 2009 as compared to 13% in 2008 and 8% in 2007. Internet Revenues Internet revenues reflect sales of IP based data services, including MPLS. Internet revenues increased $145 million, or 7%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 and increased $573 million, or 36%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increases were due to higher IP revenues as business subscribers are increasing requirements to support wireless customers data traffic, as well as revenue growth in our cable VoIP, which experienced a 15% increase in subscribers in 2009 as compared to 2008 and a 32% increase in 2008 as compared to 2007. Internet revenues generated from the provision of services to the Wireless segment represented 11% of total Internet revenues in 2009 as compared to 9% in 2008 and 5% in 2007. 41 Table of Contents Other Revenues Other revenues, which primarily consist of sales of customer premises equipment, decreased $35 million, or 24%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 and decreased $23 million, or 14%, in 2008 as compared to 2007 as a result of fewer projects in 2009 and 2008. Costs of Services and Products Costs of services and products include access costs paid to local phone companies, other domestic service providers and foreign phone companies to complete calls made by our domestic subscribers, costs to operate and maintain our networks and costs of equipment. Costs of services and products decreased $529 million, or 13%, in 2009 from 2008 and decreased $254 million, or 6%, in 2008 from 2007. The decrease in 2009 is primarily due to declining voice volumes and a shift in mix to lower cost products as a result of the migration from data to IP based technologies. The decrease in 2008 is mainly due to improved access cost rates and declining volumes. Service gross margin percentage increased from 31% in 2007 to 34% in 2008 and to 35% in 2009, primarily as a result of revenue growth in our cable VoIP business and a decrease in costs of services offset by a decrease in voice revenue. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $220 million, or 23%, as compared to 2008 and increased $22 million, or 2% in 2008 as compared 2007. The 2009 decrease was primarily due to a reduction in employee headcount and a decline in the use of outside services and maintenance as part of our cost cutting initiatives. The 2008 increase was primarily driven by the absence of a favorable settlement with Vonage recognized in 2007 related to the use of certain patents within our patent portfolio. Total selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net services revenue was 13% in 2009 and 15% in both 2008 and 2007. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,891 $ 6,179 $ 9,245 Net cash used in investing activities (3,844 ) (4,250 ) (6,377 ) Net cash used in financing activities (919 ) (484 ) (2,668 ) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $4.9 billion in 2009 decreased by $1.3 billion from 2008, primarily due to a $3.6 billion decrease in cash received from our subscribers as a result of declining service revenues from our loss of post paid subscribers and a $200 million contribution to the Company pension plan during 2009. These declines were offset by a decrease of $2.1 billion in cash paid to our suppliers and employees primarily due to reductions in variable cost of services and products and selling, general and administrative expenses due to the various cost cutting initiatives implemented over the past year. Net cash provided by operating activities of $6.2 billion in 2008 decreased $3.1 billion from 2007, primarily due to a $3.8 billion decrease in cash received from our subscribers as a result of declining service revenues from our loss of post paid subscribers. This was offset by a decrease of $1.2 billion in cash paid to our suppliers and employees. Net cash provided by operating activities for both 2008 and 2007 is net of cash used for operating activities of approximately $300 million that related to our operations that were contributed to Clearwire in November 2008. 42 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for 2009 decreased by $406 million from 2008, primarily due to an increase of $369 million in proceeds from short term investments and a decrease in capital expenditures of $2.3 billion in 2009 as compared to 2008 mainly due to fewer cell sites built in 2009, fewer IT and network development projects and costs incurred related to the build up of WiMAX in 2008 that are no longer being incurred in 2009 due to the close of the transaction with Clearwire in November 2008. The decreases were offset by increased purchases of $599 million in short term investments, a $1.1 billion increase of Sprints investment in Clearwire and $560 million used to acquire VMU and iPCS in the fourth quarter 2009. Net cash used in investing activities for 2008 decreased by $2.1 billion from 2007, primarily due to the decrease in capital expenditures of $2.4 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007 mainly due to lower number of cell sites built in 2008, reduced capacity needs, fewer IT projects as well as substantial completion in 2007 of various initiatives that were undertaken in our Wireless business, an increase in the proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments of $189 million and a decrease in the purchase of short term investments of $143 million in 2008 compared to 2007. In addition, we used $287 million in 2007 to acquire Northern PCS, a PCS Affiliate. These decreases were partially offset by the $866 million in cash collateral received from our securities loan agreements initiated in 2007. Net cash used in investing activities for 2008 and 2007 include expenditures of approximately $600 million and $700 million, respectively, related to capital assets and FCC licenses that were contributed to Clearwire in November 2008. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $919 million during 2009 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $484 million in 2008. Activities in 2009 include debt repayments of $600 million of senior notes in May 2009, the early redemption of $607 million of our convertible senior notes in September 2009, and a $1 billion payment on our revolving bank credit facility in November 2009 offset by the issuance of $1.3 billion of senior notes in August 2009. Net cash used in financing activities was $484 million during 2008 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $2.7 billion in 2007. Activities in 2008 include the draw down of $2.5 billion under our revolving bank credit facility in February 2008, the net proceeds from the financing obligation with TowerCo Acquisition LLC related to a sale and subsequent leaseback of multiple tower locations in September 2008 of $645 million, and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper of $681 million, offset by the early redemption of $1.25 billion of our senior notes in June 2008, the extinguishment in September 2008 of $235 million of US Unwired Inc.s 10% Second Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2012, the extinguishment in September 2008 of $250 million of Alamosa (Delaware), Inc.s 8.5% Senior Notes due 2012, the repayment of $1.5 billion of our revolving bank credit facility in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 and maturities of commercial paper of $1.1 billion. We repurchased about 87 million of our common shares for $1.8 billion in 2007 pursuant to our share repurchase program. We did not repurchase any shares under this program during 2008, which was the year the program expired. We received $4 million, $57 million and $344 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively in proceeds from common share issuances, primarily resulting from exercises of employee options. We did not pay any cash dividends in 2009 or 2008 and paid cash dividends of $286 million in 2007. Capital Requirements We currently anticipate that future funding needs in the near term will include: operating expenses relating to our operations; capital expenditures, including the capacity and upgrading of our networks and the deployment of new technologies in our networks; scheduled debt service requirements; amounts required to be expended in connection with the Report and Order; 43 Table of Contents any additional investment we may choose to make in Clearwire; certain costs of compliance with regulatory mandates; and other general corporate expenditures. Liquidity As of December 31, 2009, our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $3.9 billion. In addition, we have $2.7 billion available under our existing revolving bank credit facility, which expires in December 2010. The terms and conditions of our revolving bank credit facility require the ratio of total indebtedness to trailing four quarters earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other non recurring items, as defined by the credit facility (adjusted EBITDA), to be no more than 4.25 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2009, the ratio was 3.5 to 1.0 as compared to 3.0 to 1.0 as of December 31, 2008 resulting from our decline in adjusted EBITDA. Under this revolving bank credit facility, we are currently restricted from paying cash dividends because our ratio of total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA exceeds 2.5 to 1.0. The terms of the revolving bank credit facility provide for an interest rate equal to LIBOR, plus a margin of between 2.50% and 3.00%, depending on our debt ratings. Certain of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the revolving bank credit facility. As of December 31, 2009, we had $1.8 billion in letters of credit outstanding, including a $1.7 billion letter of credit required by the Report and Order to reconfigure the 800 MHz band, and no outstanding balance under our $4.5 billion revolving bank credit facility. As a result of the outstanding letters of credit, which directly impacts the availability of the revolving bank credit facility, we had $2.7 billion of borrowing capacity available under our revolving bank credit facility as of December 31, 2009. A default under our credit facilities could trigger defaults under our other debt obligations, including our senior notes, which in turn could result in the maturities of certain debt obligations being accelerated. The indentures that govern our outstanding senior notes also require that we comply with various covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness and liens by us and our subsidiaries. We expect to remain in compliance with these covenants through at least the end of 2011, although there can be no assurance that we will do so. Although we expect to improve our post paid subscriber results, if we do not meet our plan, depending on the severity of the actual subscriber results versus what we currently anticipate, it is possible that we would not remain in compliance with our covenants or be able to meet our debt service obligations, which could result in acceleration of our indebtedness. If such unforeseen events occur, we may engage with our lenders to obtain appropriate waivers or amendments of our credit facilities or refinance borrowings, although there is no assurance we would be successful in any of these actions. Sprints current liquidity position makes it likely that we will be able to meet our debt service requirements and other funding needs at least through 2011. Specifically, we expect to be able to meet our currently identified funding needs through at least the end of 2011 by using our anticipated cash flows from operating activities as well as our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments on hand. In addition, we also have available the remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving bank credit facility of $2.7 billion through December 19, 2010. Nevertheless, if we are unable to reduce the rate of losses of post paid subscribers in 2010, it would have a significant negative impact on cash provided by operating activities and our liquidity in future years. In determining that we expect to meet our funding needs through at least 2011, we have considered: anticipated levels of capital expenditures and FCC license acquisitions; anticipated payments under the Report and Order, as supplemented; any contributions we may make to our pension plan, which has been negatively impacted by the high degree of volatility in the global financial markets; scheduled debt service requirements; any additional investment we may choose to make in Clearwire; and other future contractual obligations. 44 Table of Contents Our assessment above does not take into account, among other things: any significant additional acquisition transactions or the pursuit of any significant new business opportunities or spectrum acquisition strategies; and any material increases in the cost of compliance with regulatory mandates. Any of these events or circumstances could involve significant additional funding needs in excess of anticipated cash flows from operating activities and the identified currently available funding sources, including existing cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and borrowings available under our existing revolving credit facility. If existing capital resources are not sufficient to meet these funding needs, it would be necessary to raise additional capital to meet those needs. Our ability to fund our capital needs from outside sources is ultimately affected by the overall capacity and terms of the banking and securities markets. Given our recent financial performance as well as the volatility in these markets, we continue to monitor them closely and to take steps to maintain financial flexibility and a reasonable cost of capital. As of December 31, 2009, Moodys Investor Service, Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P), and Fitch Ratings had assigned the following credit ratings to certain of our outstanding obligations: Rating Rating Agency Senior UnsecuredBank CreditFacility SeniorUnsecured Debt Outlook Moodys Baa2 Ba3 Negative Standard and Poors Not Rated BB Watch Negative Fitch BB BB Negative Downgrades of our current ratings do not accelerate scheduled principal payments of our existing debt. However, downgrades may cause us to incur higher interest costs on our credit facilities and future borrowings, if any, and could negatively impact our access to the public capital markets. As of December 31, 2009, we had working capital of $1.8 billion compared to $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2008. CURRENT BUSINESS OUTLOOK We endeavor to both add new and retain our existing wireless subscribers in order to reverse the net loss in post paid wireless subscribers that we have been experiencing. We expect to improve our subscriber trends by continuing to improve the customer experience and through offers which provide value, simplicity and productivity. Given the current economic environment, the difficulties the economic uncertainties create in forecasting, as well as the inherent uncertainties in predicting future customer behavior, we are unable to say with assurance the amount of net retail post paid subscriber losses we will experience during 2010 or thereafter. However, the Company expects that both post paid and total subscriber losses will improve in 2010 as compared to 2009. Our net subscriber losses have significantly reduced our revenue and operating cash flow. These effects will continue if we do not attract new subscribers and or reduce our rate of churn. See Wireless Segment Earnings above for a discussion of how our subscriber trends will impact our segment earnings trends. Also, these subscriber losses have decreased and will further decrease our adjusted EBITDA, as defined by our revolving bank credit facility. Management implemented cost reduction programs designed to decrease our cost structure by reducing our labor and other costs; however, we do not expect that the reduction in costs will fully offset the revenue declines described above. The above discussion is subject to the risks and other cautionary and qualifying factors set forth under Forward Looking Statements and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in this report. 45 Table of Contents FUTURE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments as of December 31, 2009. Future events, including additional purchases of our securities and refinancing of those securities, could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts. See Forward Looking Statements. Future Contractual Obligations Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 andthereafter (in millions) Senior notes, bank credit facilities and debentures(1) $ 32,854 $ 2,158 $ 2,993 $ 3,932 $ 2,848 $ 2,269 $ 18,654 Capital leases and financing obligation(2) 1,826 93 78 79 81 83 1,412 Operating leases(3) 13,998 1,651 1,622 1,484 1,350 1,186 6,705 Purchase orders and other commitments(4) 13,598 6,635 2,038 1,743 1,389 894 899 Total $ 62,276 $ 10,537 $ 6,731 $ 7,238 $ 5,668 $ 4,432 $ 27,670 (1) Includes principal and estimated interest payments. Interest payments are based on managements expectations for future interest rates. (2) Represents capital lease payments including interest and financing obligation related to the sale and subsequent leaseback of multiple tower sites. (3) Includes future lease costs related to cell and switch sites, real estate, network equipment and office space. (4) Includes service, spectrum, network capacity and other executory contracts. Excludes blanket purchase orders in the amount of $50 million. See below for further discussion. Purchase orders and other commitments include minimum purchases we commit to purchase from suppliers over time and or the unconditional purchase obligations where we guarantee to make a minimum payment to suppliers for goods and services regardless of whether suppliers fully deliver them. Amounts actually paid under some of these other agreements will likely be higher due to variable components of these agreements. The more significant variable components that determine the ultimate obligation owed include hours contracted, subscribers and other factors. In addition, we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and create an obligation to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the delivery of functioning software or products. Because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements, no such amounts have been included in the table above. The table above also excludes about $50 million of blanket purchase order amounts since their agreement terms are not specified. No time frame is set for these purchase orders and they are not legally binding. As a result, they are not firm commitments. Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $284 million as of December 31, 2009. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the timing of the resolution of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular year(s) in the table. The table above does not include remaining costs to be paid in connection with the fulfillment of our obligations under the Report and Order. The Report and Order requires us to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury at the conclusion of the band reconfiguration process to the extent that the value of the 1.9 GHz spectrum we received exceeds the total of the value of licenses for spectrum in the 700 MHz and 800 MHz bands that we surrendered under the decision plus the actual costs, or qualifying costs, that we incur to retune incumbents and our own facilities. The total minimum cash obligation for the Report and Order is $2.8 billion. From the inception of the program through December 31, 2009, we have incurred approximately $2.4 billion of costs directly attributable to the spectrum reconfiguration program. This amount does not include any of our internal network costs that we have preliminarily allocated to the reconfiguration program for capacity sites and modifications for which we may request credit under the reconfiguration program. We estimate, based on our experience to date with the reconfiguration program and on information currently available, that our total direct costs attributable to complete the spectrum reconfigurations will range between $3.4 and $3.7 billion. Accordingly, we believe that it is unlikely that we will be required to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury. 46 Table of Contents OFF BALANCE SHEET FINANCING We do not participate in, or secure, financings for any unconsolidated, special purpose entities. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Sprint applies those accounting policies that management believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Sprints more critical accounting policies include those related to the basis of presentation, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation and recoverability of our equity method investment in Clearwire, valuation and recoverability of long lived assets, evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived assets for impairment, and accruals for taxes based on income. Inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management. Management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment. These critical accounting policies have been discussed with Sprints Board of Directors. Sprints significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Sprint and its consolidated subsidiaries. Investments where Sprint maintains majority ownership, but lacks full decision making ability over all major issues, are accounted for using the equity method. Governance for Sprints major unconsolidated investment, Clearwire, is based on Clearwire board representation for which Sprint does not have a majority vote. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from failure of our subscribers to make required payments. Our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts considers a number of factors, including collection experience, aging of the accounts receivable portfolios, credit quality of the subscriber base, estimated proceeds from future bad debt sales and other qualitative considerations. To the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends, the required allowance amounts could differ from our estimate. A 10% change in the amount estimated to be uncollectible would result in a corresponding change in bad debt expense of about $20 million for the Wireless segment and $1 million for the Wireline segment. Valuation and Recoverability of our Equity Method Investment in Clearwire We assess our equity method investment for other than temporary impairment when indicators such as decline in quoted prices in active markets indicate a value below the carrying value of our investment. This evaluation requires significant judgment regarding, but not limited to, the severity and duration of decline in market prices; the ability and intent to hold the securities until recovery; financial condition, liquidity, and near term prospects of the issuer, specific events, and other factors. Sprints assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to changes in facts and circumstances. Sprint owns a 56% ownership interest in Clearwire for which the carrying value as of December 31, 2009 was $4.3 billion while the value of such investment based on Clearwires closing stock price was $3.5 billion. Sprint continues to believe that we will fully recover the carrying value of our investment. Valuation and Recoverability of Long lived Assets Long lived assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization. Changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets, as well as changes in economic or industry factors or in our business or prospects, may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change. Property, plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated economic useful lives. Certain network assets are depreciated using the group life method. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of 47 Table of Contents property, plant and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. When these factors indicate that an assets useful life is different from the previous assessment, we depreciate the remaining book values prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. Depreciation rates for assets using the group life method are revised periodically as required under this method. Changes made as a result of depreciable life studies and rate changes generally do not have a material effect on depreciation expense. Long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Long lived asset groups were determined based upon certain factors including assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of our assets, a loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the assets. Impairment analyses, when performed, are based on our current business and technology strategy, views of growth rates for our business, anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability. During 2009, we tested long lived assets in our Wireless segment for recoverability and, based on our estimate of undiscounted cash flows, determined the carrying value to be recoverable. Our estimate of undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of these assets by more than 10%. If we continue to have operational challenges, including obtaining and retaining subscribers, future cash flows of the Company may not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of our wireless asset group, and we could record asset impairments that are material to Sprints consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In addition to the analyses described above, certain assets that have not yet been deployed in the business, including network equipment, cell site development costs and software in development, are periodically assessed to determine recoverability. Network equipment and cell site development costs are expensed whenever events or changes in circumstances cause the Company to conclude the assets are no longer needed to meet managements strategic network plans and will not be deployed. Software development costs are expensed when it is no longer probable that the software project will be deployed. Network equipment that has been removed from the network is also periodically assessed to determine recoverability. If we continue to have challenges retaining subscribers and as we continue to assess the impact of rebanding the iDEN network, management may conclude in future periods that certain CDMA and iDEN assets will never be either deployed or redeployed, in which case non cash charges that could be material to our consolidated financial statements would be recognized. Evaluation of Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price paid over the fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. Sprint evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed estimated fair value. Our analysis includes a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill applies to the carrying value, including goodwill, of that reporting unit. We regularly assess whether any indicators of impairment exist, which requires a significant amount of judgment. Such indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization; a decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and or slower growth rates, among others. Any adverse change in these factors could result in an impairment that could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The determination of the estimated fair value of the wireless reporting unit and other assets and liabilities within the wireless reporting unit requires significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) and capital expenditures forecasts. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. The merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit, as well as the fair values of the corresponding assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, are evaluated for reasonableness. 48 Table of Contents FCC licenses and our Sprint and Boost Mobile trademarks have been identified as indefinite lived intangible assets, in addition to goodwill, after considering the expected use of the assets, the regulatory and economic environment within which they are being used, and the effects of obsolescence on their use. When required, Sprint assesses the recoverability of other indefinite lived intangibles, including FCC licenses which are carried as a single unit of accounting. In assessing recoverability of FCC licenses, we estimate the fair value of such licenses using the Greenfield direct value method, which approximates value through estimating the discounted future cash flows of a hypothetical start up business. Assumptions key in estimating fair value under this method include, but are not limited to, capital expenditures, subscriber activations and deactivations, market share achieved, tax rates in effect and discount rate. A 1 percent decline in our assumed revenue growth rate used to estimate terminal value, a 1 percent decline in our assumed net cash flows or a 1 percent adverse change in any of the key assumptions referred to above would not result in an impairment of our FCC licenses as of the most recent testing date. A decline in the estimated fair value of FCC licenses of up to 20% also would not result in an impairment of the carrying value. Accruals for Taxes Based on Income Uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of complex U.S. federal and state tax regulations. Management expects that Sprints interpretations will prevail. Also, Sprint has recognized deferred tax benefits relating to its future utilization of past operating losses. Sprint believes it is more likely than not that the amounts of deferred tax assets in excess of the related valuation allowances will be realized. The accounting estimates related to the tax valuation allowance require us to make assumptions regarding the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. These assumptions require significant judgment because actual performance has fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future. The impact that changes in actual performance versus these estimates could have on the realization of tax benefits as reported in our results of operations could be material. The accounting estimates related to the liability for uncertain tax positions require us to make judgments regarding the sustainability of each uncertain tax position based on its technical merits. These estimates are updated based on the facts, circumstances and information available. We are also required to assess at each annual reporting date whether it is reasonably possible that any significant increases or decreases to the unrecognized tax benefits will occur during the next twelve months. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 168, The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the only source of authoritative generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States, except that rules and interpretive releases issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also are sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. Subsequent to the issuance of SFAS No. 168, the FASB will no longer issue Statements, Staff Positions, or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts, but will issue Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) which will amend the Codification. As a result, the Codification supersedes authoritative literature effective prior to June 2009. The FASB issued authoritative literature in connection with accounting for Business Combinations, Non controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements and Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities which were effective for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. The Business Combinations guidance was adopted on January 1, 2009. As a result of adoption, for our fourth quarter acquisitions outlined in our notes to the consolidated financial statements, we recognized a gain of $151 million ($92 million after tax) related to the increase to estimated fair value of our non controlling interest in VMU. In addition, under the new guidance, transaction costs and costs associated with exit activities are expensed as incurred. The remaining guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In November 2008, the FASB issued authoritative literature regarding Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations, to clarify the application of equity method accounting. Among other things, this literature requires equity method investors to account for equity investee share issuances as if the investor had 49 Table of Contents sold a proportionate share of its investment, with the recognition of any resulting gain or loss in earnings. The Company adopted these requirements effective January 1, 2009. As a result, we recognized a pre tax loss of $154 million ($96 million after tax) related to the dilution of our investment in Clearwire resulting from their first quarter 2009 share issuance. In April 2009, the FASB issued authoritative literature regarding (i) Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies (ii) Recognition and Presentation of Other Than Temporary Impairments, which amends the other than temporary impairment guidance for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements and (iii) Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly which provides additional guidance on determining fair value when the volume and level of trading activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased when compared with normal market activity. These pronouncements were effective beginning in the second quarter 2009 and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, the FASB issued further guidance related to Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies, to address application issues relevant to initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination. This guidance, which did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements, is effective for business combinations on or after January 1, 2009 and was utilized in the accounting for the acquisitions outlined in our notes to the consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative literature regarding Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), which changes various aspects of accounting for and disclosures of interests in variable interest entities, and the Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, which was issued in order to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets; the effects of a transfer on its financial position, financial performance, and cash flows; and a transferors continuing involvement, if any, in transferred financial assets. This guidance will be effective beginning in January 2010 and is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2009, the FASB modified the accounting for Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements and Certain Revenue Arrangements that Include Software Elements. These modifications alter the methods previously required for allocating consideration received in multiple element arrangements to require revenue allocation to elements containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality. These modifications will be effective prospectively for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 and are currently being evaluated to determine the effect, if any, on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, which requires new and amended disclosure requirements for classes of assets and liabilities, inputs and valuation techniques and transfers between levels of fair value measurements and Accounting for Distributions to Shareholders with Components of Stock and Cash, which clarifies the accounting for distributions to shareholders that offer them the ability to elect to receive their entire distribution in cash or shares of equivalent value. This guidance will be effective beginning in January 2010, and is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 50 Table of Contents FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We include certain estimates, projections and other forward looking statements in our annual, quarterly and current reports, and in other publicly available material. Statements regarding expectations, including performance assumptions and estimates relating to capital requirements, as well as other statements that are not historical facts, are forward looking statements. These statements reflect managements judgments based on currently available information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements. With respect to these forward looking statements, management has made assumptions regarding, among other things, subscriber and network usage, subscriber growth and retention, pricing, operating costs, the timing of various events and the economic and regulatory environment. Future performance cannot be assured. Actual results may differ materially from those in the forward looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include: our ability to attract and retain subscribers; the effects of vigorous competition on a highly penetrated market, including the impact of competition on the price we are able to charge subscribers for services and equipment we provide and our ability to attract new subscribers and retain existing subscribers; the overall demand for our service offerings, including the impact of decisions of new or existing subscribers between our post paid and prepaid services offerings and between our two network platforms; and the impact of new, emerging and competing technologies on our business; the effect of limiting or reducing capital and operating expenditures on our ability to improve and enhance our networks and service offerings, implement our business strategies and provide competitive new technologies; our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, including at the expiration of our current credit facility, which expires on December 19, 2010; volatility in the trading price of our common stock, current economic conditions and our ability to access capital; the impact of unrelated parties not meeting our business requirements, including a significant adverse change in the ability or willingness of such parties to provide devices or infrastructure equipment for our CDMA network, or Motorola, Inc.s ability or willingness to provide related devices, infrastructure equipment and software applications, or to develop new technologies and devices or features, for our iDEN network; the costs and business risks associated with providing new services and entering new geographic markets; the financial performance of Clearwire and its deployment of a 4G network; the impact of difficulties we may encounter in connection with the integration of the businesses and assets of Virgin Mobile USA, Inc. and iPCS, Inc., including the risk that these difficulties may limit our ability to fully integrate the operations of these businesses and the risk that we may be unable to continue to retain key employees; the effects of mergers and consolidations and new entrants in the communications industry and unexpected announcements or developments from others in the communications industry; unexpected results of litigation filed against us or our suppliers or vendors; the impact of adverse network performance; the costs or potential customer impacts of compliance with regulatory mandates; equipment failure, natural disasters, terrorist acts or other breaches of network or information technology security; 51 Table of Contents one or more of the markets in which we compete being impacted by changes in political, economic or other factors such as monetary policy, legal and regulatory changes or other external factors over which we have no control; and other risks referenced from time to time in this report, including in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors and other filings of ours with the SEC. The words may, could, estimate, project, forecast, intend, expect, believe, target, plan, providing guidance and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are found throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and elsewhere in this report. The reader should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We are not obligated to publicly release any revisions to forward looking statements to reflect events after the date of this report, including unforeseen events. FINANCIAL STRATEGIES General Risk Management Policies Our board of directors has adopted a financial risk management policy that authorizes us to enter into derivative transactions, and all transactions comply with the policy. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes with the exception of equity rights obtained in connection with commercial agreements or strategic investments, usually in the form of warrants to purchase common shares. Derivative instruments are used for hedging and risk management purposes even if not designated as such for purposes of accounting. Hedging activities may be done for various purposes, including, but not limited to, mitigating the risks associated with an asset, liability, committed transaction or probable forecasted transaction. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through stringent credit approval and review processes, credit support agreements, continual review and monitoring of all counterparties, and thorough legal review of contracts. Exposure to market risk is controlled by regularly monitoring changes in hedge positions under normal and stress conditions to ensure they do not exceed established limits. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are primarily exposed to the market risk associated with unfavorable movements in interest rates, foreign currencies, and equity prices. The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors. Interest Rate Risk The communications industry is a capital intensive, technology driven business. We are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our borrowings. Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows. Specific interest rate risk includes: the risk of increasing interest rates on floating rate debt and the risk of increasing interest rates for planned new fixed rate long term financings or refinancings. About 90% of our debt as of December 31, 2009 was fixed rate debt. While changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt, there is no impact to earnings and cash flows because we intend to hold these obligations to maturity unless market and other conditions are favorable. We perform interest rate sensitivity analyses on our variable rate debt. These analyses indicate that a one percentage point change in interest rates would have an annual pre tax impact of $18 million on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2009. We also perform a sensitivity analysis on the fair market value of our outstanding debt. A 10% decline in market interest rates would cause an $872 million increase in the fair market value of our debt to $20.9 billion. Foreign Currency Risk We also enter into forward contracts and options in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Our foreign exchange risk management program focuses on reducing transaction 52 Table of Contents exposure to optimize consolidated cash flow. We use foreign currency derivatives to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to settlement of international telecommunications access charges and the operation of our international subsidiaries. The dollar equivalent of our net foreign currency payables from international settlements was $4 million and the net foreign currency receivables from international operations was $5 million as of December 31, 2009. The potential immediate pre tax loss to us that would result from a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates based on these positions would be insignificant. Equity Risk We are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments. We invest in equity instruments of public and private companies for operational and strategic business purposes. These securities are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to volatility of the stock market and industries in which the companies operate. These securities, which are classified in investments and short term investments on the consolidated balance sheets, include equity method investments, such as our investment in Clearwire, investments in private securities, and available for sale securities. In certain business transactions, we are granted warrants to purchase the securities of other companies at fixed rates. These warrants are supplemental to the terms of the business transaction and are not designated as hedging instruments. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Business Strategies and Key Priorities Sprint is a communications company offering a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications products and services that are designed to meet the needs of individual consumers, businesses, government subscribers and resellers. The communications industry has been and will continue to be highly competitive on the basis of price, the types of services and devices offered and the quality of service. As discussed below in Effects on our Wireless Business of Post paid Subscriber Losses, the Company has experienced significant losses of subscribers in the critical post paid wireless market and is currently focused on specific steps to reduce such losses. Our business strategy is to be responsive to changing consumer mobility demands by being innovative and differentiated in the marketplace. Significant steps in positioning ourselves for 2010 include our fourth quarter 2009 investment agreement with Clearwire to contribute an additional $1.176 billion increasing our ownership percentage to 56% as of December 31, 2009 and enhancing Clearwires ability to further its 4G network buildout; and the fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions of Virgin Mobile USA, Inc. (VMU) allowing us to broaden our product offerings in the prepaid wireless market and iPCS, Inc. (iPCS) to expand our direct subscriber base, grow our direct coverage area and simplify our business operations. Our future growth plans and strategy revolve around the following key priorities: Improve the customer experience; Strengthen the Sprint brand; and Generate operating cash flow. Our Sprint brand stands for Simplicity, Productivity and Value by making it affordable to do more than just talk. We have reduced confusion over pricing plans and complex bills with our Simply Everything and Everything Data plans and our Any Mobile AnytimeSM feature that offer savings compared to our competition. In addition to savings offered to consumers, new Business Advantage pricing plans are available to our business subscribers who can also take advantage of Any Mobile, AnytimeSM with certain plans. To simplify and improve the customer experience, we have introduced tools such as Sprint&reg; One Click that allows subscribers to access various software applications through a single click on their mobile devices and Ready Now which trains our subscribers before they leave the store on how to use their mobile devices. For our business subscribers, we aim to increase their productivity by helping them upgrade from older, less flexible network technologies to IP and by providing differentiated services that utilize the advantages of combining IP networks with wireless technology. This differentiation enables us to acquire and retain both wireline only and combined wireline wireless subscribers on our networks. Consistent with the changing economic environment, our prepaid plans, primarily through the National Boost Monthly Unlimited, Virgin Mobile and Assurance Wireless offerings, are experiencing strong demand as our simple, no long term contract solutions provide good service and value. We plan to continue to grow our position in the prepaid market by tailoring our products and services to target markets while leveraging our Boost Mobile, Virgin Mobile and Assurance Wireless brands through new and existing distribution channels. Sprint has refocused its wholesale business as a reseller of new converged services that leverage the Sprint network but are sold under the customers brand. We have adopted new pricing models, made it easier for our customers to acquire access and resell our services by bundling wireless and wireline services and focused our attention to partners with existing distribution channels. In addition, we have strengthened our sales efforts and expanded to new markets in the rapidly growing machine to machine space. 29 Table of Contents In addition to our customer oriented goals, we have also taken steps to generate operating cash flow and reduce our cost structure to align with the reduced revenues from fewer post paid subscribers. Our actions include workforce reductions in 2009, which are expected to reduce labor and other costs by approximately $1.5 billion annually. We believe these actions, as well as our continued efforts to reduce other operating expenses and non essential capital spending, will allow us to maintain a strong cash position, although we do not expect that these measures will fully offset the decline in cash provided by operating activities expected because of our lower number of post paid subscribers as discussed below in Effects on our Wireless Business of Post paid Subscriber Losses. Effects on our Wireless Business of Post paid Subscriber Losses The following table shows annual net additions (losses) of post paid subscribers for the past five years, excluding subscribers obtained through business combinations. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 2006 2005 ( in thousands) Total net additions (losses) of post paid subscribers (3,546 ) (4,073 ) (1,224 ) 279 2,194 As shown by the table below under Results of Operations, Wireless segment earnings represent more than 80% of Sprints total consolidated segment earnings. Within the Wireless segment, post paid wireless voice and data services represent the most significant contributors to earnings and are driven by the number of post paid subscribers to our services, as well as the average revenue per subscriber or user (ARPU). Beginning in mid 2006, Sprint began to experience net losses of post paid subscribers on the iDEN wireless network, which we acquired in 2005 in the Sprint Nextel merger. Such net losses for the year ended December 31, 2007 exceeded the net additions of post paid subscribers on our CDMA wireless network. Beginning in 2008 and continuing through 2009, we have been experiencing net losses of post paid subscribers on each of the iDEN and CDMA wireless networks, excluding migration of subscribers between networks. We believe that these significant net post paid subscriber losses resulted from a number of historical factors, in addition to the competitive nature of the industry, including: 1) uncertainty in the marketplace as to our commitment to the iDEN network; 2) a high level of involuntary churn during 2007 and early 2008 due to a relatively high mix of sub prime credit subscribers; 3) adverse perceptions among some of our subscribers about our customer care services; 4) adverse perceptions among some of our subscribers about the quality of and our commitment to development of our networks; 5) successful competitor devices; 6) perception in the marketplace that the portfolio of Sprint device offerings was not as desirable as those of some competitors; 7) uncertainty about the financial strength and future reliability of Sprint; and 8) perceptions in the marketplace, in part as a result of the subscriber losses themselves, as well as the other factors above, that reduced the Sprint brands effectiveness in attracting and retaining subscribers. Beginning in 2008, in conjunction with changes in senior management, Sprint undertook steps to address each of these factors. Before directly addressing brand perception, steps were taken to improve the quality of Sprints customer care services and the Sprint networks, as confirmed by recent independent comparisons with competitors. Steps were also taken to improve the credit quality mix of our subscriber base and to improve our financial stability, including vigorous cost control actions, which have resulted in our continuing strong cash flow from operations. We also improved financial flexibility through renegotiation in 2008 of our revolving bank credit facility. In addition, beginning in 2008 and continuing in 2009, we have undertaken increased marketing initiatives, to increase market awareness of the improvements that have been achieved in the customer experience, including the speed and dependability of our network. We have also introduced new devices improving our overall lineup and providing a competitive mix for customer selection, as well as competitive new rate plans providing simplicity and value. 30 Table of Contents We expect these actions will have a favorable impact on net subscriber losses. Net post paid subscriber losses had not improved sustainably through the first quarter of 2009, in part due to circumstances in the general economy, including higher deactivations of business customer accounts as companies reduced wireless service lines resulting from their own workforce reductions. However, during 2009, the Company began to see improvement in our net loss of post paid subscribers. Net post paid subscriber losses decreased by approximately 20% sequentially for each of the quarters ended June 30, 2009 and September 30, 2009 and by approximately 35% sequentially for the quarter ended December 31, 2009. Net post paid subscriber losses during the six months ended December 31, 2009 decreased by more than 40% compared to the same period in the prior year. As discussed below under Wireless Business Service Revenue, the net loss of post paid subscribers in 2009 can be expected to cause wireless service revenue in 2010 to be approximately $2.1 billion lower. If we continue to experience similar losses of post paid subscribers in 2010, it would have a significant negative impact on Sprints financial condition, results of operations and liquidity in 2010 and beyond. During 2009, wireless industry trends have included a significant industry wide shift for new accounts from post paid wireless accounts to prepaid accounts. Sprints successful prepaid wireless offerings, as well as the cost controls that have been implemented, will partially offset the effects of net post paid subscriber losses, but are unlikely to be sufficient to sustain the Companys level of profitability and cash flows unless we are successful in further reducing the decline in post paid subscribers. The Company believes the actions that have been taken, as described above, and that continue to be taken in marketing, customer service, device offerings, and network quality, should reduce the number of net post paid and total subscriber losses for 2010 as compared to 2009. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008(1) 2007 (in millions) Wireless segment earnings $ 5,198 $ 6,776 $ 9,914 Wireline segment earnings 1,221 1,175 1,074 Corporate, other and eliminations (12 ) (287 ) (188 ) Consolidated segment earnings 6,407 7,664 10,800 Depreciation and amortization (7,416 ) (8,407 ) (8,933 ) Goodwill impairment (963 ) (29,649 ) Merger and integration expenses (130 ) (516 ) Other, net (389 ) (806 ) (442 ) Operating loss (1,398 ) (2,642 ) (28,740 ) Interest expense (1,450 ) (1,362 ) (1,433 ) Equity in losses of unconsolidated investments, net (803 ) (145 ) (3 ) Other income, net 157 89 401 Income tax benefit 1,058 1,264 331 Net loss $ (2,436 ) $ (2,796 ) $ (29,444 ) (1) Consolidated results of operations include the results of our next generation wireless broadband network, which was contributed to Clearwire in a transaction that closed on November 28, 2008. Consolidated segment earnings decreased $1.26 billion, or 16%, in 2009 compared to 2008 and $3.14 billion, or 29%, in 2008 compared to 2007. Consolidated segment earnings consist of our Wireless and Wireline segments, which are discussed below, and Corporate, other and eliminations. Corporate, other and eliminations improved $275 million for 2009 compared to 2008 and declined $99 million for 2008 compared to 2007 primarily as a result of costs incurred related to the build up of WiMAX from 2007 to 2008 that are no longer being incurred in 2009 due to the close of the transaction with Clearwire in late 2008. 31 Table of Contents Depreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation expense decreased $137 million, or 2%, in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to reduced capital expenditures in 2009 as compared to 2008 and increased $343 million, or 6%, in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to increases of in service network assets. Amortization expense declined $854 million, or 35%, in 2009 compared to 2008 and $869 million, or 26%, in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily due to the amortization of the customer relationships acquired as part of the Sprint Nextel merger, which are amortized using the sum of the years digits method, resulting in higher amortization rates in early periods that decline over time. Goodwill Impairment The Company recognized non cash goodwill impairments of $963 million and $29.649 billion during 2008 and 2007, respectively. The impaired goodwill was primarily attributable to the Companys acquisition of Nextel in 2005 and reflects the reduction in estimated fair value of Sprints wireless reporting unit subsequent to the acquisition resulting from, among other factors, net losses of post paid subscribers. Merger and Integration Expenses Merger and integration expenses related to business combinations prior to 2008 were generally classified as selling, general and administrative and cost of products as appropriate on the consolidated statement of operations. Those not solely and directly attributable to the Wireless segment were included in Corporate, other and eliminations and were classified as selling, general and administrative expenses. Merger and integration expenses decreased $130 million, or 100%, in 2009 compared to 2008 and $386 million, or 75%, in 2008 as compared to 2007 as we did not incur these costs in the second half of 2008. Other, net The following table provides additional information of items included in Other, net for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Severance and exit costs $ (400 ) $ (355 ) $ (277 ) Asset impairments (47 ) (480 ) (163 ) Gains from asset dispositions and exchanges 68 29 Other (10 ) (2 ) Total $ (389 ) $ (806 ) $ (442 ) Other, net expenses decreased $417 million, or 52%, in 2009 compared to 2008 and increased $364 million, or 82%, in 2008 compared to 2007. Severance and exit costs increased by $45 million, or 13%, in 2009 compared to 2008 and $78 million, or 28%, in 2008 compared to 2007 due to separation of employees and continued organizational realignment initiatives aimed at reducing our cost structure to align with reduced revenues from net subscriber losses. Asset impairments decreased by $433 million, or 90%, in 2009 compared to 2008 and increased $317 million, or 194%, in 2008 compared to 2007. Asset impairments in 2009 primarily related to network asset equipment no longer necessary for managements strategic plans and, in addition, in 2008 also related to cell site development costs no longer necessary for managements strategic plans. During 2007, asset impairments related to the write off of network assets, including site development costs, the loss on the sale of Velocita Wireless, and the closing of retail stores due to integration activities. Gains from asset dispositions and exchanges increased by $39 million, or 134%, in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to spectrum exchange transactions. 32 Table of Contents Interest Expense Interest expense increased $88 million, or 7%, in 2009 as compared to 2008, as fewer capital projects led to a decrease of $111 million of capitalized interest partially offset by a decrease of $56 million related to a $1.5 billion decline in the weighted average long term debt balance between the comparative periods. In addition, we had $35 million of interest credits in 2008 related to the reversal of accrued interest due to the completion of income tax audits. Interest expense decreased $71 million in 2008 as compared to 2007, due to the reduction in our average effective interest rates, partially offset by an increase in the weighted average long term debt balance. The effective interest rate on the weighted average long term debt balance of $21.4 billion, $22.9 billion and $21.8 billion was 6.8%, 6.6% and 6.9% for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information on the Companys financing activities. Equity in Losses of Unconsolidated Investments, net This item consists mainly of our proportionate share of earnings or losses from our equity method investments. Equity losses of $649 million associated with the investment in Clearwire represent the Companys proportionate share of Clearwires net loss for 2009, plus a pre tax loss of $154 million ($96 million after tax) related to the dilution of our investment in Clearwire from 53% to 51% during the first quarter 2009. During the fourth quarter 2009, we invested approximately $1.1 billion in Clearwire which increased our economic ownership to 56%. Prospectively, from the date of this subsequent investment, our equity income (loss) from Clearwire will represent our proportionate share of Clearwires results of operations based on our increased economic interest. We expect Clearwire to continue to generate a net loss as it continues build out of its 4G network. Other income, net The following table provides additional information of items included in Other income, net for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Interest income $ 34 $ 97 $ 151 Realized gain (loss) from investments (29 ) (24 ) 253 Gain from non controlling interest in VMU 151 Other 1 16 (3 ) Total $ 157 $ 89 $ 401 Interest income decreased $63 million, or 65%, in 2009 as compared to 2008, primarily due to lower interest rates. Interest income decreased $54 million, or 36%, in 2008 as compared to 2007, primarily due to lower interest rates and the recognition of interest income on income tax settlements of $31 million in 2007. A realized gain of $253 million was recognized in 2007, primarily related to the sale of a portion of our equity interest in VMU and a dilution of our ownership percentage to 14.1% in conjunction with their initial public offering of stock. As a result of the fourth quarter 2009 acquisition of VMU, a non cash gain of $151 million ($92 million after tax) was recognized related to the estimated fair value over net carrying value of our previously held non controlling interest in VMU. Income Tax Benefit As a result of our pre tax losses, the consolidated effective tax rate was a benefit of approximately 30%, 31% and 1% in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively. The 2009 effective tax rate was reduced by a $281 million net increase to the valuation allowance for federal and state deferred tax assets related to net operating and capital loss carryforwards. The 2008 and 2007 effective tax rates were reduced by $794 million of the $963 million non cash goodwill impairment in 2008 and $29.3 billion of the $29.6 billion non cash goodwill impairment in 2007 as substantially all of the charges are not separately deductible for tax purposes. Additional information related to items impacting the effective tax rates can be found in note 11 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 33 Table of Contents Segment Earnings Wireless Business Wireless segment earnings are primarily a function of wireless service revenue, costs to acquire subscribers, network and interconnection costs to serve those subscribers and other Wireless segment operating expenses. The costs to acquire our subscribers include our equipment cost in excess of the price at which we sell our devices, referred to as equipment net subsidies, as well as the marketing and sales costs incurred to attract those subscribers. Network costs primarily represent switch and cell site costs and interconnection costs, which generally consist of per minute usage fees and roaming fees paid to other carriers. The remaining costs associated with operating the Wireless segment include the costs to operate our customer care organization and administrative support. Wireless service revenue, costs to acquire subscribers, and variable network and interconnection costs fluctuate with the changes in our subscriber base and their related usage, but some cost elements do not fluctuate in the short term with the changes in our subscriber usage. The following table provides an overview of the results of operations of our Wireless segment for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Year Ended December 31, Wireless Earnings 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Post paid $ 23,205 $ 25,994 $ 29,454 Prepaid 2,081 1,498 1,590 Retail service revenue 25,286 27,492 31,044 Wholesale, affiliate and other revenue 546 943 1,061 Total service revenue 25,832 28,435 32,105 Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization) (8,384 ) (8,745 ) (8,612 ) Service gross margin 17,448 19,690 23,493 Service gross margin percentage 68 % 69 % 73 % Equipment revenue 1,954 1,992 2,595 Cost of products (5,545 ) (4,859 ) (5,023 ) Equipment net subsidy (3,591 ) (2,867 ) (2,428 ) Equipment net subsidy percentage (184 )% (144 )% (94 )% Selling, general and administrative expense (8,659 ) (10,047 ) (11,151 ) Wireless segment earnings $ 5,198 $ 6,776 $ 9,914 Service Revenue Our Wireless segment generates revenues from the sale of wireless services, the sale of wireless devices and accessories and the sale of wholesale and other services. Service revenue consists of fixed monthly recurring charges, variable usage charges and miscellaneous fees such as activation fees, directory assistance, roaming, equipment protection, late payment and early termination charges and certain regulatory related fees, net of service credits. The ability of our Wireless segment to generate service revenues is primarily a function of: revenue generated from each subscriber, which in turn is a function of the types and amount of services utilized by each subscriber and the rates charged for those services; and the number of subscribers that we serve, which in turn is a function of our ability to acquire new and retain existing subscribers. 34 Table of Contents The table below summarizes average number of retail subscribers and average revenue per subscriber for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Retail comprises those subscribers to whom Sprint directly provides wireless services on our networks, whether those services are provided on a prepaid or a post paid basis. Wholesale and affiliates are those subscribers who are served through MVNO and affiliate relationships, and other arrangements through which wireless services are sold by Sprint to other companies that resell those services to their subscribers. More information about the number of subscribers, net additions to subscribers, and average rates of monthly post paid and prepaid customer churn for each quarter since the first quarter 2007 may be found in the table on page 37. Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (subscribers in thousands) Average post paid subscribers(1) 34,640 38,752 41,454 Average prepaid subscribers(1) 5,313 4,135 4,391 Average monthly service revenue per subscriber: Post paid $ 56 $ 56 $ 59 Prepaid 33 30 30 Average retail 53 53 56 (1) Average subscribers include subscribers acquired through business combinations prospectively from the date of acquisition. Average subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2009 are inclusive of 4,539,000 prepaid subscribers and 835,000 post paid subscribers acquired through our 2009 business combinations which were previously included with wholesale and affiliate subscribers. Average subscribers for the year ended December 31, 2007 are inclusive of 170,000 subscribers acquired through our 2007 business combination. Retail service revenue decreased $2.2 billion, or 8%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 and $3.6 billion, or 11% in 2008 as compared to 2007. The majority of the decline is due to a $2.8 billion and $3.5 billion decrease in post paid service revenue driven by a reduction in the Companys average number of post paid subscribers of approximately 4.1 million and 2.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The decline in post paid service revenue was partially offset by an increase of $583 million in prepaid revenue for 2009 as compared to 2008, primarily driven by attracting subscribers to the Companys National Boost Monthly Unlimited plan, which launched in the first quarter of 2009. Prepaid revenue for 2008 decreased $92 million as compared to 2007, primarily driven by a reduction of 256,000 in the average number of retail prepaid subscribers, primarily on the iDEN network. Wholesale, affiliate and other revenues, in total, decreased $397 million, or 42%, for 2009 as compared to 2008, and $118 million, or 11%, for 2008 as compared to 2007. The decrease in 2009 was primarily due to a decrease in the number of subscribers with two of our large MVNO operators. Wholesale revenues include a growing number of devices under our open device initiative, including machine to machine services through devices that utilize our network. Average revenue per subscriber for our open device machine to machine services is significantly lower than revenue from other wholesale and affiliate subscribers; however, the cost to service these customers is also lower resulting in a higher profit margin as a percent of revenue. The decrease in 2008 was primarily due to a decline in average monthly service revenue per wholesale subscriber. 35 Table of Contents Average Monthly Service Revenue per Subscriber Below is a table showing average revenue per retail post paid and prepaid subscriber for the past twelve quarters. Quarter Ended March 31,2007 June 30,2007 September 30,2007 December 31,2007 March 31,2008 June 30,2008 September 30,2008 December 31,2008 March 31,2009 June 30,2009 September 30,2009 December 31,2009 Averagemonthly servicerevenue persubscriber(1) Post paid $ 59 $ 60 $ 59 $ 58 $ 56 $ 56 $ 56 $ 56 $ 56 $ 56 $ 56 $ 55 Prepaid $ 32 $ 31 $ 30 $ 28 $ 29 $ 30 $ 31 $ 30 $ 31 $ 34 $ 35 $ 31 (1) Average monthly service revenue per subscriber for the quarter is calculated by dividing quarterly service revenue by the sum of the average number of subscribers for each month in the quarter. Changes in average monthly service revenue reflect subscribers who change rate plans, the level of voice and data usage during a quarter, the amount of service credits which are offered to subscribers, plus the net effect of average monthly revenue generated by new subscribers and deactivating subscribers. Average monthly post paid service revenue per subscriber was stable throughout 2008 and most of 2009 as a result of improved retention of higher revenue subscribers on bundled rate plans offset by lower overage and roaming revenues. During the fourth quarter 2009, the Company experienced a decline in average monthly post paid service revenue per subscriber due to declines in overage revenues resulting from the increased popularity of fixed rate bundled plans including the Any Mobile Anytime feature. The decline in average monthly retail post paid service revenue per subscriber in 2007 was due to the loss of iDEN subscribers with higher priced service plans and the migration of iDEN subscribers to lower priced plans. Our average monthly service revenue per subscriber in 2007 also declined due to other reasons, the most significant of which is the number of service credits accepted by our subscribers on both networks, which increased due to our retention efforts. Average monthly prepaid service revenue per subscriber increased during 2009 as compared to 2008 due to higher revenue from our National Boost Monthly Unlimited users combined with more stable average revenue per subscriber from our traditional prepaid users. During the fourth quarter 2009, average monthly prepaid service revenue per subscriber was reduced by the addition of Virgin Mobile subscribers which carry a lower average revenue per subscriber compared to Sprints other prepaid subscribers. Net Additions to (Losses of) Subscribers The wireless industry is subject to intense competition to acquire and retain subscribers of wireless services. Most markets in which we operate have high rates of penetration for wireless services. Wireless carriers accordingly must attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from competitors rather than from first time subscribers. As a result, wireless carriers have focused on retaining valued subscribers through various means including considerable efforts in customer care. Our retention efforts have been focused on improving the customer experience, including, but not limited to, our Simply Everything bundled plans that provide unlimited voice, data, text and Nextel Direct Connect&reg; services; improved service levels from our customer care centers; and our Ready Now program. As discussed above in Overview, we have endeavored to retain and attract subscribers by taking actions to improve our customer care, sales and distribution functions, and brand awareness. In addition, we have taken other actions in an effort to improve our subscribers experience including improving our network performance by adding capacity to our networks, broadening our device portfolio, and providing subscribers an excellent value proposition with our Simply Everything&reg; pricing plans and our Everything Data plans which include our new Any Mobile, AnytimeSM feature. While certain indicators suggest that we are making progress with respect to these actions, we have continued to lose valuable post paid wireless subscribers. 36 Table of Contents The following table shows (a) net additions (losses) of wireless subscribers for the past twelve quarters, excluding subscribers obtained through business combinations, existing subscribers who have migrated between networks (b) our total subscribers as of the end of each quarterly period, and (c) our average rates of monthly post paid and prepaid customer churn for the past twelve quarters.

(2) Churn is calculated by dividing net subscriber deactivations for the quarter by the sum of the average number of subscribers for each month in the quarter. For post paid accounts comprising multiple subscribers, such as family plans and enterprise accounts, net deactivations are defined as deactivations in excess of customer activations in a particular account within 30 days. Post paid and Prepaid churn consists of both voluntary churn, where the subscriber makes his or her own determination to cease being a customer, and involuntary churn, where the customers service is terminated due to a lack of payment or other reasons. (3) Reflects the transfer of 170,000 subscribers from Wholesale and affiliates to Post paid due to a business combination in the quarter ended September 30, 2007 as well as the transfer of 4,539,000 Prepaid and 835,000 Post paid subscribers from Wholesale and affiliates as a result of the business combinations completed in the fourth quarter 2009. 37 Table of Contents Retail Post Paid Subscribers We lost 3.5 million net post paid subscribers during 2009 as compared to losing 4.1 million and 1.2 million net post paid subscribers during 2008 and 2007, respectively. The following table provides a reconciliation of reported net additions (losses) of retail post paid subscribers and transfers of subscribers between network technologies during the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. CDMA Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in thousands) Reported net additions (losses) (1,512 ) (1,634 ) 1,568 Net transfers from iDEN 321 1,199 1,563 Additions (losses) after transfers from iDEN (1,191 ) (435 ) 3,131 iDEN Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in thousands) Reported net losses (2,034 ) (2,439 ) (2,792 ) Net transfers to CDMA (321 ) (1,199 ) (1,563 ) Losses after transfers to CDMA (2,355 ) (3,638 ) (4,355 ) The Company expects that both post paid and total subscriber full year net losses should improve for the year 2010 as compared to 2009. However, our actual loss of post paid subscribers in 2009 can be expected to cause wireless service revenue in 2010 to be approximately $2.1 billion lower than it would have been had those subscribers not been lost. If we continue to experience significant loss of post paid subscribers in 2010, it would have a significant negative impact on Sprints financial condition, results of operations and liquidity in 2010 and beyond. Prepaid Subscribers We added approximately 2.6 million net prepaid subscribers during 2009 as compared to losing 981,000 and adding 566,000 net prepaid subscribers in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Our net prepaid subscriber additions in 2009 were principally driven by the Companys National Boost Monthly Unlimited offering on the iDEN network which was launched in the first quarter 2009. The success achieved by the National Boost Monthly Unlimited offering has driven a significant prepaid market share gain. In conjunction with the changing economic environment, the Companys National Boost Monthly Unlimited offering continues to experience strong demand as prepaid decisions are becoming a larger portion of overall decisions in the marketplace. Net prepaid subscriber losses in 2008 as compared to net additions in 2007 were principally caused by our attracting fewer new subscribers on the iDEN network and total deactivations increasing year over year. End of period prepaid subscribers include subscribers engaged in certain retention programs that target qualifying subscribers to maintain ongoing service while providing additional time to make a replenishment prior to account deactivation. Subscribers targeted through retention programs are not included in the calculation of churn until their offer expires without a replenishment to their account. Wholesale and Affiliate Subscribers Wholesale and affiliate subscribers represent customers that are served on our networks through companies that resell our services to their subscribers, customers residing in PCS Affiliate territories and a growing portion of subscribers from our open device initiative primarily representing machine to machine devices that utilize our network. During 2009, wholesale and affiliate subscriber losses were 138,000, compared to net subscriber additions of 472,000 and 1.4 million for 2008 and 2007, respectively. Subscriber losses in 2009 were primarily due to a decrease in the number of subscribers with two of our large MVNO operators. 38 Table of Contents Cost of Services Cost of services consists primarily of: costs to operate and maintain our CDMA and iDEN networks, including direct switch and cell site costs, such as rent, utilities, maintenance, payroll costs associated with network employees and spectrum frequency leasing costs; fixed and variable interconnection costs, the fixed component of which consists of monthly flat rate fees for facilities leased from local exchange carriers based on the number of cell sites and switches in service in a particular period and the related equipment installed at each site, and the variable component of which generally consists of per minute use fees charged by wireline providers for calls terminating on their networks, which fluctuate in relation to the level and duration of those terminating calls; long distance costs paid to the Wireline segment; costs to service and repair devices; regulatory fees; roaming fees paid to other carriers; and fixed and variable costs relating to payments to third parties for the use of their proprietary data applications, such as messaging, music, TV and navigation services by our subscribers. Cost of services decreased $361 million, or 4%, in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily reflecting a decline in labor, outside services and maintenance costs consistent with the Companys cost cutting efforts, as well as a decline in network costs associated with fewer subscribers. Cost of services increased $133 million, or 2%, in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily reflecting increased costs relating to data and voice roaming outside of our networks and increased service and repair costs related to devices with increased functionality. In addition, backhaul costs, including usage of our wireline network, have increased primarily due to increased data usage by our subscribers and the expansion of EV DO Rev. A in our network. These costs have been slightly offset by lower employee related and outside services costs. Equipment Net Subsidy We recognize equipment revenue and corresponding costs of devices when title of the device passes to the dealer or end user customer. Our marketing plans assume that devices typically will be sold at prices below cost, which is consistent with industry practice, as subscriber retention efforts often include providing incentives to subscribers such as offering new devices at discounted prices. We reduce equipment revenue for these discounts offered directly to the customer, or for certain payments to third party dealers to reimburse the dealer for point of sale discounts that are offered to the end user subscriber. Additionally, the cost of devices is reduced by any rebates that are earned from the supplier. Cost of devices and accessories also includes order fulfillment related expenses and write downs of device and related accessory inventory for shrinkage and obsolescence. Equipment costs in excess of the revenues generated from equipment sales is referred to in the industry as equipment net subsidy. Equipment revenue decreased $38 million, or 2%, in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to declining average sales prices for those devices as a result of competitive and economic pressures, partially offset by an increase in the number of devices sold in 2009 as compared to 2008. Equipment revenue decreased $603 million, or 23%, in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a decrease in the number of devices sold in 2008 as compared to 2007, partially offset by an increase in the average sales prices for those devices as customers began to purchase more smartphones. Cost of devices increased $699 million, or 15%, in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to our mix of devices sold reflecting a greater mix of post paid devices sold with a higher functionality and an increase in the number of devices sold. Cost of devices decreased $165 million, or 3%, in 2008 compared to 2007, primarily due to a decrease in the number of devices sold partially offset by an increase in the average cost per device as our mix of devices sold consisted of a higher percentage of smartphones and higher end devices. 39 Table of Contents Selling, General and Administrative Expense Sales and marketing costs primarily consist of customer acquisition costs, including commissions paid to our indirect dealers, third party distributors and retail sales force for new device activations and upgrades, residual payments to our indirect dealers, payroll and facilities costs associated with our retail sales force and stores and marketing employees, advertising, media programs and sponsorships, including costs related to branding. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for billing, customer care and information technology operations, bad debt expense and administrative support activities, including collections, legal, finance, human resources, strategic planning and technology and product development. Sales and marketing expense decreased $273 million, or 6%, in 2009 from 2008 as compared to $722 million, or 13%, in 2008 from 2007. The decline in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 and 2008 is primarily due to the decline in gross subscriber additions and a decline in labor related costs due to our workforce and cost reduction activities. General and administrative costs decreased $1.1 billion, or 22%, in 2009 from 2008 and $382 million, or 7%, in 2008 from 2007. The decline in general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily due to the decrease in employee related costs as part of our cost cutting initiatives, reduction in customer care costs, and lower bad debt expense. Employee related costs decreased approximately $536 million in 2009 as compared to 2008, due to workforce reductions announced in January and November 2009. Customer care costs decreased $363 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. Bad debt expense was $392 million for the year ended December 31, 2009 representing a $240 million decline, as compared to bad debt expense of $632 million in 2008. The improvement in bad debt expense resulted from lower rates of uncollectibility during the period, as well as lower estimated uncollectible accounts in outstanding accounts receivable. Our improvement in customer care expense is largely attributable to customer care quality initiatives that were launched in 2008. These initiatives resulted in fewer calls per subscriber into customer care which was reduced by 39% from 2007 peak levels. The reduction in calls per subscriber allowed for a reduction of 19 call centers in 2009 and 11 call centers in 2008. We also have several customer care and collection activities designed to proactively contact subscribers to ensure they are on appropriate service plans based on their usage and to negotiate payment arrangements designed to help customers through difficult financial times. As a result, we have experienced a decrease in involuntary churn, as well as a decrease in the number of accounts and average balances written off in 2009 compared to 2008. The decline in general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2008 was principally due to the decrease in bad debt expense and lower employee related costs, offset by an increase in customer care related costs. Bad debt expense was $632 million for the year ended December 31, 2008 as compared to $896 million for 2007 representing a $264 million decline. The improvement in bad debt expense was largely attributable to credit policies for new customers and the customer care quality initiatives launched in 2008. Specifically, the ratio of subscribers with a prime credit score to those with a subprime credit score improved in 2008 as compared to 2007. 40 Table of Contents Segment Earnings Wireline Wireline segment earnings are primarily a function of wireline service revenue, network and interconnection costs and other Wireline segment operating expenses. Network costs primarily represent special access costs and interconnection costs which generally consist of domestic and international per minute usage fees paid to other carriers. The remaining costs associated with operating the Wireline segment include the costs to operate our customer care and billing organizations in addition to administrative support. Wireline service revenue, and variable network and interconnection costs fluctuate with the changes in our customer base and their related usage, but some cost elements do not fluctuate in the short term with the changes in our customer usage. Our Wireline segment provides services to our Wireless segment which are generally accounted for based on market rates which we believe approximate fair value. The following table provides an overview of the results of operations of our Wireline segment for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008 and 2007. Year Ended December 31, Wireline Earnings 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Voice $ 2,563 $ 3,079 $ 3,509 Data 662 959 1,210 Internet 2,293 2,148 1,575 Other 111 146 169 Total net service revenue 5,629 6,332 6,463 Cost of services and products (3,663 ) (4,192 ) (4,446 ) Service gross margin 1,966 2,140 2,017 Service gross margin percentage 35 % 34 % 31 % Selling, general and administrative expense (745 ) (965 ) (943 ) Wireline segment earnings $ 1,221 $ 1,175 $ 1,074 Wireline Revenue Voice Revenues Voice revenues decreased $516 million, or 17%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 and decreased $430 million, or 12%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. The 2009 and 2008 decreases were primarily driven by volume declines due to customer churn as well as overall price declines. Voice revenues generated from the sale of services to our Wireless segment represented 31% of total voice revenues in 2009 as compared to 26% in 2008 and 23% in 2007. Data Revenues Data revenues reflect sales of data services, including ATM, frame relay and managed network services. Data revenues decreased $297 million, or 31%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 and decreased $251 million, or 21%, in 2008 as compared to 2007 due to declines in frame relay and ATM services as subscribers migrated to IP based technologies. These declines were partially offset by growth in IP revenues. Data revenues generated from the provision of services to the Wireless segment represented 19% of total data revenue in 2009 as compared to 13% in 2008 and 8% in 2007. Internet Revenues Internet revenues reflect sales of IP based data services, including MPLS. Internet revenues increased $145 million, or 7%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 and increased $573 million, or 36%, in 2008 as compared to 2007. The increases were due to higher IP revenues as business subscribers are increasing requirements to support wireless customers data traffic, as well as revenue growth in our cable VoIP, which experienced a 15% increase in subscribers in 2009 as compared to 2008 and a 32% increase in 2008 as compared to 2007. Internet revenues generated from the provision of services to the Wireless segment represented 11% of total Internet revenues in 2009 as compared to 9% in 2008 and 5% in 2007. 41 Table of Contents Other Revenues Other revenues, which primarily consist of sales of customer premises equipment, decreased $35 million, or 24%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 and decreased $23 million, or 14%, in 2008 as compared to 2007 as a result of fewer projects in 2009 and 2008. Costs of Services and Products Costs of services and products include access costs paid to local phone companies, other domestic service providers and foreign phone companies to complete calls made by our domestic subscribers, costs to operate and maintain our networks and costs of equipment. Costs of services and products decreased $529 million, or 13%, in 2009 from 2008 and decreased $254 million, or 6%, in 2008 from 2007. The decrease in 2009 is primarily due to declining voice volumes and a shift in mix to lower cost products as a result of the migration from data to IP based technologies. The decrease in 2008 is mainly due to improved access cost rates and declining volumes. Service gross margin percentage increased from 31% in 2007 to 34% in 2008 and to 35% in 2009, primarily as a result of revenue growth in our cable VoIP business and a decrease in costs of services offset by a decrease in voice revenue. Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $220 million, or 23%, as compared to 2008 and increased $22 million, or 2% in 2008 as compared 2007. The 2009 decrease was primarily due to a reduction in employee headcount and a decline in the use of outside services and maintenance as part of our cost cutting initiatives. The 2008 increase was primarily driven by the absence of a favorable settlement with Vonage recognized in 2007 related to the use of certain patents within our patent portfolio. Total selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net services revenue was 13% in 2009 and 15% in both 2008 and 2007. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 (in millions) Net cash provided by operating activities $ 4,891 $ 6,179 $ 9,245 Net cash used in investing activities (3,844 ) (4,250 ) (6,377 ) Net cash used in financing activities (919 ) (484 ) (2,668 ) Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $4.9 billion in 2009 decreased by $1.3 billion from 2008, primarily due to a $3.6 billion decrease in cash received from our subscribers as a result of declining service revenues from our loss of post paid subscribers and a $200 million contribution to the Company pension plan during 2009. These declines were offset by a decrease of $2.1 billion in cash paid to our suppliers and employees primarily due to reductions in variable cost of services and products and selling, general and administrative expenses due to the various cost cutting initiatives implemented over the past year. Net cash provided by operating activities of $6.2 billion in 2008 decreased $3.1 billion from 2007, primarily due to a $3.8 billion decrease in cash received from our subscribers as a result of declining service revenues from our loss of post paid subscribers. This was offset by a decrease of $1.2 billion in cash paid to our suppliers and employees. Net cash provided by operating activities for both 2008 and 2007 is net of cash used for operating activities of approximately $300 million that related to our operations that were contributed to Clearwire in November 2008. 42 Table of Contents Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for 2009 decreased by $406 million from 2008, primarily due to an increase of $369 million in proceeds from short term investments and a decrease in capital expenditures of $2.3 billion in 2009 as compared to 2008 mainly due to fewer cell sites built in 2009, fewer IT and network development projects and costs incurred related to the build up of WiMAX in 2008 that are no longer being incurred in 2009 due to the close of the transaction with Clearwire in November 2008. The decreases were offset by increased purchases of $599 million in short term investments, a $1.1 billion increase of Sprints investment in Clearwire and $560 million used to acquire VMU and iPCS in the fourth quarter 2009. Net cash used in investing activities for 2008 decreased by $2.1 billion from 2007, primarily due to the decrease in capital expenditures of $2.4 billion in 2008 as compared to 2007 mainly due to lower number of cell sites built in 2008, reduced capacity needs, fewer IT projects as well as substantial completion in 2007 of various initiatives that were undertaken in our Wireless business, an increase in the proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments of $189 million and a decrease in the purchase of short term investments of $143 million in 2008 compared to 2007. In addition, we used $287 million in 2007 to acquire Northern PCS, a PCS Affiliate. These decreases were partially offset by the $866 million in cash collateral received from our securities loan agreements initiated in 2007. Net cash used in investing activities for 2008 and 2007 include expenditures of approximately $600 million and $700 million, respectively, related to capital assets and FCC licenses that were contributed to Clearwire in November 2008. Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $919 million during 2009 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $484 million in 2008. Activities in 2009 include debt repayments of $600 million of senior notes in May 2009, the early redemption of $607 million of our convertible senior notes in September 2009, and a $1 billion payment on our revolving bank credit facility in November 2009 offset by the issuance of $1.3 billion of senior notes in August 2009. Net cash used in financing activities was $484 million during 2008 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $2.7 billion in 2007. Activities in 2008 include the draw down of $2.5 billion under our revolving bank credit facility in February 2008, the net proceeds from the financing obligation with TowerCo Acquisition LLC related to a sale and subsequent leaseback of multiple tower locations in September 2008 of $645 million, and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper of $681 million, offset by the early redemption of $1.25 billion of our senior notes in June 2008, the extinguishment in September 2008 of $235 million of US Unwired Inc.s 10% Second Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2012, the extinguishment in September 2008 of $250 million of Alamosa (Delaware), Inc.s 8.5% Senior Notes due 2012, the repayment of $1.5 billion of our revolving bank credit facility in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 and maturities of commercial paper of $1.1 billion. We repurchased about 87 million of our common shares for $1.8 billion in 2007 pursuant to our share repurchase program. We did not repurchase any shares under this program during 2008, which was the year the program expired. We received $4 million, $57 million and $344 million in 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively in proceeds from common share issuances, primarily resulting from exercises of employee options. We did not pay any cash dividends in 2009 or 2008 and paid cash dividends of $286 million in 2007. Capital Requirements We currently anticipate that future funding needs in the near term will include: operating expenses relating to our operations; capital expenditures, including the capacity and upgrading of our networks and the deployment of new technologies in our networks; scheduled debt service requirements; amounts required to be expended in connection with the Report and Order; 43 Table of Contents any additional investment we may choose to make in Clearwire; certain costs of compliance with regulatory mandates; and other general corporate expenditures. Liquidity As of December 31, 2009, our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $3.9 billion. In addition, we have $2.7 billion available under our existing revolving bank credit facility, which expires in December 2010. The terms and conditions of our revolving bank credit facility require the ratio of total indebtedness to trailing four quarters earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other non recurring items, as defined by the credit facility (adjusted EBITDA), to be no more than 4.25 to 1.0. As of December 31, 2009, the ratio was 3.5 to 1.0 as compared to 3.0 to 1.0 as of December 31, 2008 resulting from our decline in adjusted EBITDA. Under this revolving bank credit facility, we are currently restricted from paying cash dividends because our ratio of total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA exceeds 2.5 to 1.0. The terms of the revolving bank credit facility provide for an interest rate equal to LIBOR, plus a margin of between 2.50% and 3.00%, depending on our debt ratings. Certain of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the revolving bank credit facility. As of December 31, 2009, we had $1.8 billion in letters of credit outstanding, including a $1.7 billion letter of credit required by the Report and Order to reconfigure the 800 MHz band, and no outstanding balance under our $4.5 billion revolving bank credit facility. As a result of the outstanding letters of credit, which directly impacts the availability of the revolving bank credit facility, we had $2.7 billion of borrowing capacity available under our revolving bank credit facility as of December 31, 2009. A default under our credit facilities could trigger defaults under our other debt obligations, including our senior notes, which in turn could result in the maturities of certain debt obligations being accelerated. The indentures that govern our outstanding senior notes also require that we comply with various covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness and liens by us and our subsidiaries. We expect to remain in compliance with these covenants through at least the end of 2011, although there can be no assurance that we will do so. Although we expect to improve our post paid subscriber results, if we do not meet our plan, depending on the severity of the actual subscriber results versus what we currently anticipate, it is possible that we would not remain in compliance with our covenants or be able to meet our debt service obligations, which could result in acceleration of our indebtedness. If such unforeseen events occur, we may engage with our lenders to obtain appropriate waivers or amendments of our credit facilities or refinance borrowings, although there is no assurance we would be successful in any of these actions. Sprints current liquidity position makes it likely that we will be able to meet our debt service requirements and other funding needs at least through 2011. Specifically, we expect to be able to meet our currently identified funding needs through at least the end of 2011 by using our anticipated cash flows from operating activities as well as our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments on hand. In addition, we also have available the remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving bank credit facility of $2.7 billion through December 19, 2010. Nevertheless, if we are unable to reduce the rate of losses of post paid subscribers in 2010, it would have a significant negative impact on cash provided by operating activities and our liquidity in future years. In determining that we expect to meet our funding needs through at least 2011, we have considered: anticipated levels of capital expenditures and FCC license acquisitions; anticipated payments under the Report and Order, as supplemented; any contributions we may make to our pension plan, which has been negatively impacted by the high degree of volatility in the global financial markets; scheduled debt service requirements; any additional investment we may choose to make in Clearwire; and other future contractual obligations. 44 Table of Contents Our assessment above does not take into account, among other things: any significant additional acquisition transactions or the pursuit of any significant new business opportunities or spectrum acquisition strategies; and any material increases in the cost of compliance with regulatory mandates. Any of these events or circumstances could involve significant additional funding needs in excess of anticipated cash flows from operating activities and the identified currently available funding sources, including existing cash and cash equivalents, short term investments and borrowings available under our existing revolving credit facility. If existing capital resources are not sufficient to meet these funding needs, it would be necessary to raise additional capital to meet those needs. Our ability to fund our capital needs from outside sources is ultimately affected by the overall capacity and terms of the banking and securities markets. Given our recent financial performance as well as the volatility in these markets, we continue to monitor them closely and to take steps to maintain financial flexibility and a reasonable cost of capital. As of December 31, 2009, Moodys Investor Service, Standard & Poors Ratings Services (S&P), and Fitch Ratings had assigned the following credit ratings to certain of our outstanding obligations: Rating Rating Agency Senior UnsecuredBank CreditFacility SeniorUnsecured Debt Outlook Moodys Baa2 Ba3 Negative Standard and Poors Not Rated BB Watch Negative Fitch BB BB Negative Downgrades of our current ratings do not accelerate scheduled principal payments of our existing debt. However, downgrades may cause us to incur higher interest costs on our credit facilities and future borrowings, if any, and could negatively impact our access to the public capital markets. As of December 31, 2009, we had working capital of $1.8 billion compared to $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2008. CURRENT BUSINESS OUTLOOK We endeavor to both add new and retain our existing wireless subscribers in order to reverse the net loss in post paid wireless subscribers that we have been experiencing. We expect to improve our subscriber trends by continuing to improve the customer experience and through offers which provide value, simplicity and productivity. Given the current economic environment, the difficulties the economic uncertainties create in forecasting, as well as the inherent uncertainties in predicting future customer behavior, we are unable to say with assurance the amount of net retail post paid subscriber losses we will experience during 2010 or thereafter. However, the Company expects that both post paid and total subscriber losses will improve in 2010 as compared to 2009. Our net subscriber losses have significantly reduced our revenue and operating cash flow. These effects will continue if we do not attract new subscribers and or reduce our rate of churn. See Wireless Segment Earnings above for a discussion of how our subscriber trends will impact our segment earnings trends. Also, these subscriber losses have decreased and will further decrease our adjusted EBITDA, as defined by our revolving bank credit facility. Management implemented cost reduction programs designed to decrease our cost structure by reducing our labor and other costs; however, we do not expect that the reduction in costs will fully offset the revenue declines described above. The above discussion is subject to the risks and other cautionary and qualifying factors set forth under Forward Looking Statements and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in this report. 45 Table of Contents FUTURE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments as of December 31, 2009. Future events, including additional purchases of our securities and refinancing of those securities, could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts. See Forward Looking Statements. Future Contractual Obligations Total 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 andthereafter (in millions) Senior notes, bank credit facilities and debentures(1) $ 32,854 $ 2,158 $ 2,993 $ 3,932 $ 2,848 $ 2,269 $ 18,654 Capital leases and financing obligation(2) 1,826 93 78 79 81 83 1,412 Operating leases(3) 13,998 1,651 1,622 1,484 1,350 1,186 6,705 Purchase orders and other commitments(4) 13,598 6,635 2,038 1,743 1,389 894 899 Total $ 62,276 $ 10,537 $ 6,731 $ 7,238 $ 5,668 $ 4,432 $ 27,670 (1) Includes principal and estimated interest payments. Interest payments are based on managements expectations for future interest rates. (2) Represents capital lease payments including interest and financing obligation related to the sale and subsequent leaseback of multiple tower sites. (3) Includes future lease costs related to cell and switch sites, real estate, network equipment and office space. (4) Includes service, spectrum, network capacity and other executory contracts. Excludes blanket purchase orders in the amount of $50 million. See below for further discussion. Purchase orders and other commitments include minimum purchases we commit to purchase from suppliers over time and or the unconditional purchase obligations where we guarantee to make a minimum payment to suppliers for goods and services regardless of whether suppliers fully deliver them. Amounts actually paid under some of these other agreements will likely be higher due to variable components of these agreements. The more significant variable components that determine the ultimate obligation owed include hours contracted, subscribers and other factors. In addition, we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and create an obligation to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the delivery of functioning software or products. Because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements, no such amounts have been included in the table above. The table above also excludes about $50 million of blanket purchase order amounts since their agreement terms are not specified. No time frame is set for these purchase orders and they are not legally binding. As a result, they are not firm commitments. Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $284 million as of December 31, 2009. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the timing of the resolution of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular year(s) in the table. The table above does not include remaining costs to be paid in connection with the fulfillment of our obligations under the Report and Order. The Report and Order requires us to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury at the conclusion of the band reconfiguration process to the extent that the value of the 1.9 GHz spectrum we received exceeds the total of the value of licenses for spectrum in the 700 MHz and 800 MHz bands that we surrendered under the decision plus the actual costs, or qualifying costs, that we incur to retune incumbents and our own facilities. The total minimum cash obligation for the Report and Order is $2.8 billion. From the inception of the program through December 31, 2009, we have incurred approximately $2.4 billion of costs directly attributable to the spectrum reconfiguration program. This amount does not include any of our internal network costs that we have preliminarily allocated to the reconfiguration program for capacity sites and modifications for which we may request credit under the reconfiguration program. We estimate, based on our experience to date with the reconfiguration program and on information currently available, that our total direct costs attributable to complete the spectrum reconfigurations will range between $3.4 and $3.7 billion. Accordingly, we believe that it is unlikely that we will be required to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury. 46 Table of Contents OFF BALANCE SHEET FINANCING We do not participate in, or secure, financings for any unconsolidated, special purpose entities. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Sprint applies those accounting policies that management believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Sprints more critical accounting policies include those related to the basis of presentation, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation and recoverability of our equity method investment in Clearwire, valuation and recoverability of long lived assets, evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived assets for impairment, and accruals for taxes based on income. Inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management. Management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment. These critical accounting policies have been discussed with Sprints Board of Directors. Sprints significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Sprint and its consolidated subsidiaries. Investments where Sprint maintains majority ownership, but lacks full decision making ability over all major issues, are accounted for using the equity method. Governance for Sprints major unconsolidated investment, Clearwire, is based on Clearwire board representation for which Sprint does not have a majority vote. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from failure of our subscribers to make required payments. Our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts considers a number of factors, including collection experience, aging of the accounts receivable portfolios, credit quality of the subscriber base, estimated proceeds from future bad debt sales and other qualitative considerations. To the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends, the required allowance amounts could differ from our estimate. A 10% change in the amount estimated to be uncollectible would result in a corresponding change in bad debt expense of about $20 million for the Wireless segment and $1 million for the Wireline segment. Valuation and Recoverability of our Equity Method Investment in Clearwire We assess our equity method investment for other than temporary impairment when indicators such as decline in quoted prices in active markets indicate a value below the carrying value of our investment. This evaluation requires significant judgment regarding, but not limited to, the severity and duration of decline in market prices; the ability and intent to hold the securities until recovery; financial condition, liquidity, and near term prospects of the issuer, specific events, and other factors. Sprints assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to changes in facts and circumstances. Sprint owns a 56% ownership interest in Clearwire for which the carrying value as of December 31, 2009 was $4.3 billion while the value of such investment based on Clearwires closing stock price was $3.5 billion. Sprint continues to believe that we will fully recover the carrying value of our investment. Valuation and Recoverability of Long lived Assets Long lived assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization. Changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets, as well as changes in economic or industry factors or in our business or prospects, may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change. Property, plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated economic useful lives. Certain network assets are depreciated using the group life method. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of 47 Table of Contents property, plant and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. When these factors indicate that an assets useful life is different from the previous assessment, we depreciate the remaining book values prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. Depreciation rates for assets using the group life method are revised periodically as required under this method. Changes made as a result of depreciable life studies and rate changes generally do not have a material effect on depreciation expense. Long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Long lived asset groups were determined based upon certain factors including assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of our assets, a loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the assets. Impairment analyses, when performed, are based on our current business and technology strategy, views of growth rates for our business, anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability. During 2009, we tested long lived assets in our Wireless segment for recoverability and, based on our estimate of undiscounted cash flows, determined the carrying value to be recoverable. Our estimate of undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of these assets by more than 10%. If we continue to have operational challenges, including obtaining and retaining subscribers, future cash flows of the Company may not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of our wireless asset group, and we could record asset impairments that are material to Sprints consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In addition to the analyses described above, certain assets that have not yet been deployed in the business, including network equipment, cell site development costs and software in development, are periodically assessed to determine recoverability. Network equipment and cell site development costs are expensed whenever events or changes in circumstances cause the Company to conclude the assets are no longer needed to meet managements strategic network plans and will not be deployed. Software development costs are expensed when it is no longer probable that the software project will be deployed. Network equipment that has been removed from the network is also periodically assessed to determine recoverability. If we continue to have challenges retaining subscribers and as we continue to assess the impact of rebanding the iDEN network, management may conclude in future periods that certain CDMA and iDEN assets will never be either deployed or redeployed, in which case non cash charges that could be material to our consolidated financial statements would be recognized. Evaluation of Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price paid over the fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. Sprint evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed estimated fair value. Our analysis includes a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill applies to the carrying value, including goodwill, of that reporting unit. We regularly assess whether any indicators of impairment exist, which requires a significant amount of judgment. Such indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization; a decline in our expected future cash flows, a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and or slower growth rates, among others. Any adverse change in these factors could result in an impairment that could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The determination of the estimated fair value of the wireless reporting unit and other assets and liabilities within the wireless reporting unit requires significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, the discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) and capital expenditures forecasts. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. The merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit, as well as the fair values of the corresponding assets and liabilities of the reporting unit, are evaluated for reasonableness. 48 Table of Contents FCC licenses and our Sprint and Boost Mobile trademarks have been identified as indefinite lived intangible assets, in addition to goodwill, after considering the expected use of the assets, the regulatory and economic environment within which they are being used, and the effects of obsolescence on their use. When required, Sprint assesses the recoverability of other indefinite lived intangibles, including FCC licenses which are carried as a single unit of accounting. In assessing recoverability of FCC licenses, we estimate the fair value of such licenses using the Greenfield direct value method, which approximates value through estimating the discounted future cash flows of a hypothetical start up business. Assumptions key in estimating fair value under this method include, but are not limited to, capital expenditures, subscriber activations and deactivations, market share achieved, tax rates in effect and discount rate. A 1 percent decline in our assumed revenue growth rate used to estimate terminal value, a 1 percent decline in our assumed net cash flows or a 1 percent adverse change in any of the key assumptions referred to above would not result in an impairment of our FCC licenses as of the most recent testing date. A decline in the estimated fair value of FCC licenses of up to 20% also would not result in an impairment of the carrying value. Accruals for Taxes Based on Income Uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of complex U.S. federal and state tax regulations. Management expects that Sprints interpretations will prevail. Also, Sprint has recognized deferred tax benefits relating to its future utilization of past operating losses. Sprint believes it is more likely than not that the amounts of deferred tax assets in excess of the related valuation allowances will be realized. The accounting estimates related to the tax valuation allowance require us to make assumptions regarding the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. These assumptions require significant judgment because actual performance has fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future. The impact that changes in actual performance versus these estimates could have on the realization of tax benefits as reported in our results of operations could be material. The accounting estimates related to the liability for uncertain tax positions require us to make judgments regarding the sustainability of each uncertain tax position based on its technical merits. These estimates are updated based on the facts, circumstances and information available. We are also required to assess at each annual reporting date whether it is reasonably possible that any significant increases or decreases to the unrecognized tax benefits will occur during the next twelve months. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 168, The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, which establishes the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (Codification) as the only source of authoritative generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) in the United States, except that rules and interpretive releases issued by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) also are sources of authoritative GAAP for SEC registrants. Subsequent to the issuance of SFAS No. 168, the FASB will no longer issue Statements, Staff Positions, or Emerging Issues Task Force Abstracts, but will issue Accounting Standards Updates (ASU) which will amend the Codification. As a result, the Codification supersedes authoritative literature effective prior to June 2009. The FASB issued authoritative literature in connection with accounting for Business Combinations, Non controlling Interests in Consolidated Financial Statements and Disclosures about Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities which were effective for the quarter ended March 31, 2009. The Business Combinations guidance was adopted on January 1, 2009. As a result of adoption, for our fourth quarter acquisitions outlined in our notes to the consolidated financial statements, we recognized a gain of $151 million ($92 million after tax) related to the increase to estimated fair value of our non controlling interest in VMU. In addition, under the new guidance, transaction costs and costs associated with exit activities are expensed as incurred. The remaining guidance did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In November 2008, the FASB issued authoritative literature regarding Equity Method Investment Accounting Considerations, to clarify the application of equity method accounting. Among other things, this literature requires equity method investors to account for equity investee share issuances as if the investor had 49 Table of Contents sold a proportionate share of its investment, with the recognition of any resulting gain or loss in earnings. The Company adopted these requirements effective January 1, 2009. As a result, we recognized a pre tax loss of $154 million ($96 million after tax) related to the dilution of our investment in Clearwire resulting from their first quarter 2009 share issuance. In April 2009, the FASB issued authoritative literature regarding (i) Interim Disclosures about Fair Value of Financial Instruments, to require disclosures about fair value of financial instruments for interim reporting periods of publicly traded companies (ii) Recognition and Presentation of Other Than Temporary Impairments, which amends the other than temporary impairment guidance for debt securities to make the guidance more operational and to improve the presentation and disclosure of other than temporary impairments on debt and equity securities in the financial statements and (iii) Determining Fair Value When the Volume and Level of Activity for the Asset or Liability Have Significantly Decreased and Identifying Transactions That Are Not Orderly which provides additional guidance on determining fair value when the volume and level of trading activity for an asset or liability have significantly decreased when compared with normal market activity. These pronouncements were effective beginning in the second quarter 2009 and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In addition, the FASB issued further guidance related to Accounting for Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed in a Business Combination That Arise from Contingencies, to address application issues relevant to initial recognition and measurement, subsequent measurement and accounting, and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination. This guidance, which did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements, is effective for business combinations on or after January 1, 2009 and was utilized in the accounting for the acquisitions outlined in our notes to the consolidated financial statements. In June 2009, the FASB issued authoritative literature regarding Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), which changes various aspects of accounting for and disclosures of interests in variable interest entities, and the Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, which was issued in order to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets; the effects of a transfer on its financial position, financial performance, and cash flows; and a transferors continuing involvement, if any, in transferred financial assets. This guidance will be effective beginning in January 2010 and is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2009, the FASB modified the accounting for Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements and Certain Revenue Arrangements that Include Software Elements. These modifications alter the methods previously required for allocating consideration received in multiple element arrangements to require revenue allocation to elements containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality. These modifications will be effective prospectively for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2011 and are currently being evaluated to determine the effect, if any, on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, which requires new and amended disclosure requirements for classes of assets and liabilities, inputs and valuation techniques and transfers between levels of fair value measurements and Accounting for Distributions to Shareholders with Components of Stock and Cash, which clarifies the accounting for distributions to shareholders that offer them the ability to elect to receive their entire distribution in cash or shares of equivalent value. This guidance will be effective beginning in January 2010, and is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. 50 Table of Contents FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We include certain estimates, projections and other forward looking statements in our annual, quarterly and current reports, and in other publicly available material. Statements regarding expectations, including performance assumptions and estimates relating to capital requirements, as well as other statements that are not historical facts, are forward looking statements. These statements reflect managements judgments based on currently available information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements. With respect to these forward looking statements, management has made assumptions regarding, among other things, subscriber and network usage, subscriber growth and retention, pricing, operating costs, the timing of various events and the economic and regulatory environment. Future performance cannot be assured. Actual results may differ materially from those in the forward looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include: our ability to attract and retain subscribers; the effects of vigorous competition on a highly penetrated market, including the impact of competition on the price we are able to charge subscribers for services and equipment we provide and our ability to attract new subscribers and retain existing subscribers; the overall demand for our service offerings, including the impact of decisions of new or existing subscribers between our post paid and prepaid services offerings and between our two network platforms; and the impact of new, emerging and competing technologies on our business; the effect of limiting or reducing capital and operating expenditures on our ability to improve and enhance our networks and service offerings, implement our business strategies and provide competitive new technologies; our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, including at the expiration of our current credit facility, which expires on December 19, 2010; volatility in the trading price of our common stock, current economic conditions and our ability to access capital; the impact of unrelated parties not meeting our business requirements, including a significant adverse change in the ability or willingness of such parties to provide devices or infrastructure equipment for our CDMA network, or Motorola, Inc.s ability or willingness to provide related devices, infrastructure equipment and software applications, or to develop new technologies and devices or features, for our iDEN network; the costs and business risks associated with providing new services and entering new geographic markets; the financial performance of Clearwire and its deployment of a 4G network; the impact of difficulties we may encounter in connection with the integration of the businesses and assets of Virgin Mobile USA, Inc. and iPCS, Inc., including the risk that these difficulties may limit our ability to fully integrate the operations of these businesses and the risk that we may be unable to continue to retain key employees; the effects of mergers and consolidations and new entrants in the communications industry and unexpected announcements or developments from others in the communications industry; unexpected results of litigation filed against us or our suppliers or vendors; the impact of adverse network performance; the costs or potential customer impacts of compliance with regulatory mandates; equipment failure, natural disasters, terrorist acts or other breaches of network or information technology security; 51 Table of Contents one or more of the markets in which we compete being impacted by changes in political, economic or other factors such as monetary policy, legal and regulatory changes or other external factors over which we have no control; and other risks referenced from time to time in this report, including in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors and other filings of ours with the SEC. The words may, could, estimate, project, forecast, intend, expect, believe, target, plan, providing guidance and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are found throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and elsewhere in this report. The reader should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We are not obligated to publicly release any revisions to forward looking statements to reflect events after the date of this report, including unforeseen events. FINANCIAL STRATEGIES General Risk Management Policies Our board of directors has adopted a financial risk management policy that authorizes us to enter into derivative transactions, and all transactions comply with the policy. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes with the exception of equity rights obtained in connection with commercial agreements or strategic investments, usually in the form of warrants to purchase common shares. Derivative instruments are used for hedging and risk management purposes even if not designated as such for purposes of accounting. Hedging activities may be done for various purposes, including, but not limited to, mitigating the risks associated with an asset, liability, committed transaction or probable forecasted transaction. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through stringent credit approval and review processes, credit support agreements, continual review and monitoring of all counterparties, and thorough legal review of contracts. Exposure to market risk is controlled by regularly monitoring changes in hedge positions under normal and stress conditions to ensure they do not exceed established limits. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are primarily exposed to the market risk associated with unfavorable movements in interest rates, foreign currencies, and equity prices. The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors. Interest Rate Risk The communications industry is a capital intensive, technology driven business. We are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our borrowings. Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows. Specific interest rate risk includes: the risk of increasing interest rates on floating rate debt and the risk of increasing interest rates for planned new fixed rate long term financings or refinancings. About 90% of our debt as of December 31, 2009 was fixed rate debt. While changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt, there is no impact to earnings and cash flows because we intend to hold these obligations to maturity unless market and other conditions are favorable. We perform interest rate sensitivity analyses on our variable rate debt. These analyses indicate that a one percentage point change in interest rates would have an annual pre tax impact of $18 million on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2009. We also perform a sensitivity analysis on the fair market value of our outstanding debt. A 10% decline in market interest rates would cause an $872 million increase in the fair market value of our debt to $20.9 billion. Foreign Currency Risk We also enter into forward contracts and options in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Our foreign exchange risk management program focuses on reducing transaction 52 Table of Contents exposure to optimize consolidated cash flow. We use foreign currency derivatives to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to settlement of international telecommunications access charges and the operation of our international subsidiaries. The dollar equivalent of our net foreign currency payables from international settlements was $4 million and the net foreign currency receivables from international operations was $5 million as of December 31, 2009. The potential immediate pre tax loss to us that would result from a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates based on these positions would be insignificant. Equity Risk We are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments. We invest in equity instruments of public and private companies for operational and strategic business purposes. These securities are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to volatility of the stock market and industries in which the companies operate. These securities, which are classified in investments and short term investments on the consolidated balance sheets, include equity method investments, such as our investment in Clearwire, investments in private securities, and available for sale securities. In certain business transactions, we are granted warrants to purchase the securities of other companies at fixed rates. These warrants are supplemental to the terms of the business transaction and are not designated as hedging instruments.
