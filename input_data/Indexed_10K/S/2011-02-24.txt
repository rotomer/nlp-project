Selected Financial Data The selected financial data presented below is not comparable for all periods presented primarily as a result of transactions such as the acquisitons of Nextel Partners, Inc., Virgin Mobile USA, Inc. (Virgin Mobile) and Affiliates, as well as the November 2008 contribution of our next generation wireless network to Clearwire. The acquired companies results of operations subsequent to their acquisition dates are included in our consolidated financial statements. Embarq Corporation, our former local segment, which was spun off in 2006, is shown as discontinued operations. The primary reason for the increase in net operating revenues for 2010 was related to the additional subscribers obtained in our 2009 acquisitions and the 783,000 retail wireless subscribers added in 2010 which were partially offset by a decrease in revenue as a result of our losses of subscribers in prior periods. We lost approximately 1.0 million retail wireless subscribers in 2009, 5.1 million in 2008 and 658,000 in 2007, which caused the majority of the reduction in net operating revenues in those periods.

In 2009, we recognized net charges of $389 million ($248 million after tax) primarily related to severance exit costs and asset impairments other than goodwill. In 2008, we recorded net charges of $936 million ($586 million after tax) primarily related to asset impairments other than goodwill, severance and exit costs, and merger and integration costs. In 2007, we recognized net charges of $956 million ($590 million after tax) primarily related to merger and integration costs, asset impairments other than goodwill, and severance and exit costs. In 2006, we recognized net charges of $620 million ($381 million after tax) primarily related to merger and integration costs, asset impairments, and severance and exit costs. (2) During 2010, the Company did not recognize significant tax benef its associated with federal and state net operating losses generated during the period. As a result, the Company recognized an increase in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets affecting the income tax provision by approximately $1.4 billion and $281 million for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively.(3) We did not declare any dividends on our common shares in 2010, 2009 and 2008. In each quarter of 2007 and 2006, the dividend was $0.025 per share. 23Table of ContentsItem 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Business Strategies and Key Priorities Sprint is a communications company offering a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications products and services that are designed to meet the needs of individual consumers, businesses, government subscribers and resellers. The communications industry has been and will continue to be highly competitive on the basis of price, the types of services and devices offered and the quality of service. As discussed below in Effects on our Wireless Business of Postpaid Subscriber Losses, the Company has experienced significant losses of subscribers in the critical postpaid wireless market since the third quarter 2006, but, as a result of steps taken to attract and retain such subscribers, has reduced net subscriber losses beginning in 2009.Our business strategy is to be responsive to changing customer mobility demands by being innovative and differentiated in the marketplace. Our future growth plans and strategy revolve around achieving the following three key priorities: &bull; Improve the customer experience; &bull; Strengthen our brands; and&bull; Generate operating cash flow. We have reduced confusion over pricing plans and complex bills with our Simply Everything&reg; and Everything Data plans and our Any Mobile AnytimeSM feature that offer savings compared to our competition. In addition to savings offered to consumers, Business Advantage pricing plans are available to our business subscribers who can also take advantage of Any Mobile AnytimeSM with certain plans. To simplify and improve the custom er experience, we introduced the Sprint Free Guarantee, which gives any customer opening a new line of service the chance to try Sprint for 30 days for free (excluding overages and premium services not included in price plans). In addition, we have continued to offer Ready Now, which trains our customers before they leave the store on how to use their mobile devices. For our business customers, we aim to increase their productivity by providing differentiated services that utilize the advantages of combining IP networks with wireless technology. This differentiation enables us to acquire and retain both wireline, wireless and combined wireline wireless subscribers on our networks. We have also continued to focus on further improving customer care. We implemented initiatives that are designed to improve call center processes and procedures, and standardized our performance measures through various metrics, including customer satisfaction ratings with respect to customer care, first call resolution and calls p er subscriber. Our product strategy is to provide our customers with a broad array of device selections and applications and services that run on these devices to meet the growing needs of customer mobility. Our multi functional device portfolio includes devices such as the Samsung Epic 4G Android&trade; device, which can also act as a mobile hotspot for up to five wireless fidelity (WiFi) enabled devices and the worlds first 3G/4G Android&trade; device, the HTC EVO&trade; 4G, which can also act as a mobile hotspot for up to eight WiFi enabled devices. Our portfolio also includes the Motorola i1 which is the worlds first Direct Connect&reg; Android powered smartphone. Other devices in our portfolio are the HTC Hero&trade; and the Samsung Moment&trade; with Google&trade;, the BlackBerry 8530 and BlackBerry&reg; Bold&trade;, the Samsung Seek&trade;, the Rumor Touch from LG and the Touch Pro 2 from HTC. Our mobile broadband device portfolio consists of devices such as the Overdrive&trade; 3G/4G Mobile Hotspot, which allows the connection of up to five WiFi enabled devices, the Spr int 4G USB U1901 and the Ovation&trade; U760 by Novatel Wireless. We support the open development of applications and content on our network platforms. We also enable a variety of third party providers, location based services and business and consumer product providers through our machine to machine initiative. The machine to machine initiative incorporates selling, marketing, product development and operations resources to address growing non traditional data needs, which covers a wide variety of products and services including remote monitoring, telematics, in vehicle devices, e readers, specialized medical devices and other original equipment manufacturer devices. Our prepaid portfo lio launched additional brands in the second quarter 2010. Sprints prepaid portfolio currently includes four brands, each designed to appeal to specific customer segments. Boost Mobile serves customers who are voice and text messaging centric with its popular $50 Monthly Unlimited plan with Shrinkage service where bills are reduced after six on time payments. Virgin Mobile serves customers who are device and data oriented with Beyond Talk&trade; plans and our broadband plan, Broadband2Go, that offer consumers control, flexibility and connectivity through various communication vehicles. Assurance Wireless provides eligible customers, who meet income requirements or are receiving government assistance, with a free wireless phone and 250 free minutes of national local and long distance monthly service. Common CentsSM Mobile caters to budget conscious customers with 7 cent minutes that Round Down&trade; and 7 cent text messages. Sprint has focused its wholesale business as a reseller of new converged services that leverage the Sprint network but are sold under the wholesalers brand by providing a suite of integrated and customizeable value added solutions focused on assisting our customers to improve their business. We have adopted new pricing models, made it easier for our wholesalers to acquire access and resell our services by bundling wireless and wireline services and focused our attention to partners with existing distribution channels. In addition, we have strengthened our sales efforts and expanded to new markets in the rapidly 24Table of Contentsgrowing machine to machine space. In addition to our brand and customer oriented goals, w e have also taken steps, beginning in 2008, to generate increased operating cash flow through competitive new rate plans for postpaid and prepaid subscribers, multi branded strategies and reductions to our cost structure to align with the reduced revenues from fewer postpaid subscribers. Our cost reductions are primarily attributable to reductions in capital spending, workforce reductions, call center closures as a result of fewer calls per subscriber and limiting marketing spend to focused initiatives. We believe these actions, as well as our continued efforts to reduce other operating expenses, will allow us to continue to maintain an adequate cash position. Network VisionIn December 2010, Sprint announced Network Vision, a multi year network infrastructure initiative intended to provide customers with an enhanced network experience by improving voice quality and providing faster data speeds, while creating network flexibility, reducing operating costs, and improving environmental sustainability by enabling the aggregation of multiple spectrum bands onto a single multi mode base station. In addition to implementing these multi mode base stations, this plan encompasses next generation push to talk technology with broadband capabilities and the integration of multi mode chipsets into smartphones, tablets and other broadband devices, including machine to machine capabilities. Consolidating and optimizing the use of Sprints 800 MHz, 1.9GHz and potentially other spectrum (such as the 2.5GHz owned by Clearwire) into multi mode stations should allow Sprint to repurpose spectrum to enhance coverage, particularly around the in building experience. The multi mode technolog y also utilizes software based solutions with interchangeable hardware to provide greater network flexibility, which allows for opportunities to evaluate new 4G technologies to better utilize Sprints available spectrum.The first stages of equipment testing are expected to begin in early 2011 and, if successful, broad scale deployment is expected in the latter half of 2011 with an expected completion time of anywhere from three to five years. As Network Vision is implemented, the size and power required to operate cell sites used by Sprint is expected to be reduced. Sprint expects the plan to bring financial benefit to the company through convergence to one common network, which is expected to reduce network maintenance and operating costs through capital efficiencies, reduced energy costs, lower roaming expenses, backhaul savings and the eventual reduc tion in total cell sites and also by reducing the cost of handling expanded data traffic. Sprint has entered into agreements relating to Network Vision to deploy a cost effective, innovative network to enhance the voice quality and data speeds by consolidating multiple technologies into one network. The successful testing and deployment related to these changes in technology will result in incremental charges during the period of implementation including, but not limited to, an increase in depreciation and amortization associated with existing iDEN assets due to changes in our estimates of the remaining useful lives of long lived assets, and the expected timing of asset retirement obligations, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The successful testing of push to talk technology on the CDMA network in our test mar kets in 2011 would result in increased depreciation and amortization expense expected to range from $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion if implementation can be completed by the end of 2014. Successful completion of Network Vision earlier or later than the end of 2014 would result in an acceleration or delay, respectively, of these depreciation and amortization costs.Effects on our Wireless Business of Postpaid Subscriber Losses The following table shows annual net additions (losses) of postpaid subscribers for the past five years, excluding subscribers obtained through business combinations. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 ( in thousan ds)Total net additions (losses) of postpaid subscribers(855) (3,546) (4,073) (1,224) 279 As shown by the table below under Results of Operations, Wireless segment earnings represents approximately 80% of Sprints total consolidated segment earnings. The wireless industry is subject to intense compet ition to acquire and retain subscribers of wireless services. Most markets in which we operate have high rates of penetration for wireless services. Wireless carriers accordingly must attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from competitors rather than from first time subscribers. Within the Wireless segment, postpaid wireless voice and data services represent the most significant contributors to earnings, and are driven by the number of postpaid subscribers to our services, as well as the average revenue per subscriber or user (ARPU). 25Table of ContentsBeginning in 2008, in conjunction with changes in senior management, Sprint undertook steps to address and reduce postpaid subscriber losses. Perceptions in the marketplace, in part as a result of the subscriber losses themselves, as well as other factors, reduced the Sprint brands effectiveness in attracting and retaining customers. Steps were taken to improve the Sprint networks, as well as to improve the quality of Sprints customer care experience, as confirmed by independent comparisons with competitors. Steps were also taken to improve the credit quality mix of our subscriber base and to improve our financial stability, including cost control actions, which have resulted in our continuing strong cash flow from operations. In addition, beginning in 2008 and continuing through 2010, we have undertaken initiatives to strengthen the Sprint brand. We conti nue to increase market awareness of the improvements that have been achieved in the customer experience, including the speed and dependability of our networks. We have also introduced new devices improving our overall lineup and providing a competitive portfolio for customer selection, as well as competitive new rate plans providing simplicity and value. We believe these actions had a favorable impact on net postpaid subscriber losses in 2009 and 2010, and we expect these to further improve our subscriber results. Beginning in the second quarter 2009 and continuing through 2010, the Company has begun to see a reduction in our net loss of postpaid subscribers. For the year ended December 31, 2010, net postpaid subscriber losses of 855,000 improved by 2.7 million, or 76% compared to losses of 3.5 million in 2009. The net loss of postpaid subscribers in 2009 and 2010 can be expected to cause wireless service revenue in 2011 to be approximately $2.4 billion lower than it would have bee n had those subscribers not been lost. Notwithstanding our historical postpaid subscriber losses, consolidated service revenue has begun to stabilize primarily as a result of increased service revenue associated with our prepaid wireless offerings, including the acquisition of Virgin Mobile in the fourth quarter of 2009. As a result, Sprints prepaid wireless offerings, as well as cost controls that have been implemented, will continue to partially offset the effects of net postpaid subscriber losses, but are unlikely to be sufficient to sustain the Companys level of results from operations and cash flows unless we are successful in further improving our postpaid subscriber results. If our trend of improved postpaid subscriber results does not continue, it could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity in 2011 and beyond. The Company believes the actions that have been taken, as described above, and that continue to be taken in marketing, customer servi ce, device offerings, and network quality, should continue to reduce the number of net postpaid subscriber losses experienced during 2011.

Consolidated segment earnings decreased $774 million, or 12%, in 2010 compared to 2009 and $1.26 billion, or 16%, in 2009 compared to 2008. Consolidated segment earnings consist of our Wireless and Wireline segments, which are discussed below, and Corporate, other and eliminations. Corporate, other and eliminations improved $275 million for 2009 compared to 2008 primarily as a result of costs incurred related to the build up of our next generation wireless broadband network in 2008 that are no longer being incurred in 2009 due to the close of the transaction with Clearwire in late 2008. 26Table of ContentsDepreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation expense decreased $753 million, or 13%, in 2010 compared to 2009 and $137 million, or 2%, in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a reduction in the replacement rate of capital additions resulting from reduced capital spending associated with our cost control actions beginning in 2008. The average annual capital expenditures for the three years ended 2007 were approximately $6.3 billion as compared to average annual capital expenditures of $2.5 billion for the three years ended 2010. Amortization expense declined $415 million, or 26%, in 2010 compared to 2009 and $854 million, or 35%, in 2009 as compared to 2008, primarily due to reductions in amortization of customer relationship intangible assets as a result of those related to the 2005 acquisition of Nextel becoming fully amortized. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in amortization related to customer relationship intangible assets acquired in connection with the iPCS, Inc. (iPCS) and Virgin Mobile acquisitions in the fourth quarter 2009. Customer relationships are amortized using the sum of the years digits method, resulting in higher amortization r ates in early periods that decline over time. Goodwill Impairment and Merger and Integration ExpensesThe Company recognized a non cash goodwill impairment of $963 million during 2008. The impaired goodwill was primarily attributable to the Companys acquisition of Nextel in 2005 and reflects the reduction in the estimated fair value of Sprints wireless reporting unit subsequent to the acquisition resulting from, among other factors, net losses of postpaid subscribers. Merger and integration expenses decreased $130 million, or 100%, in 2009 compared to 2008 as integration activities were completed during 2008. Other, net The following table provides additional information of items included in Other, net for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Year E nded December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions)Severance and exit costs$(8) $(400) $(355)Asset impairments(125) (47) (480)Gain s from asset dispositions and exchanges69 68 29 Other84 (10) &mdash; Total$20 $(389) $(806)Other, net improved $409 million, or 105%, in 2010 compared to 2009 and $417 million, or 52%, in 2009 compared to 2008. During 2010 we recognized $8 million of severance and exit costs primarily related to exit costs incurred in the second and fourth quarter 2010 associated with vacating certain office space which is no longer being utilized. We recognized $400 million and $355 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, of severance and exit costs related to the separation of employees and organizational realignment initiatives. Asset impairments increased by $78 million, or 166%, in 2010 compared to 2009 and decreased $433 million, or 90%, in 2009 compared to 2008. Asset impairments primarily relate to assets that are no longer necessary for managements strategic plans. In 2010 and 2009 these costs were primarily related to network asset equipment. Asset impairments in 2008 also include previously recognized cell site development costs. Gains from asset dispositions and exchanges for 2010, 2009, and 2008 are primarily related to spectrum exchange transactions. Other increased $94 million primarily due to an increase in benefits resulting from favorable developments relating to access cost disputes with certain exchange carriers in 2010 as compared to 2009. Interest Expense Interest expense increased $14 million, or 1%, in 2010 as compared to 2009. This increase was primarily due to higher effective interest rates on our average long term debt balances and increased costs on our revolving credit facilities, which include the accelerated amortization of previously unamortized debt issuance costs from the retirement of our form er credit facility in May 2010 partially offset by reductions in interest expense previously recorded as a result of favorable tax outcomes. Interest expense increased $88 million, or 7%, in 2009 as compared to 2008, as fewer capital projects led to a decrease of $111 million o f capitalized interest partially offset by a decrease of $56 million related to a $1.5 billion decline in the weighted average long term debt balance between the comparative periods. The effective interest rate on the weighted average long term debt balance of $20.6 billion, $21.4 billion and $22.9 billion was 7.2%, 6.8% and 6.6% for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information on the Companys financing activities. 27Table of ContentsEquity in Losses of Unconsolidated Investments, net This item consists mainly of our proportionate share of losses from our equity method investments. Equity losses associated with the investment in Clearwire consists of Sprints share of Clearwires net loss and other adjustments such as gains or losses associated with the dilution of Sprints ownership interest resulting from Clearwires equity issuances. Equity in losses from Clearwire were $1.3 billion, $803 million, and $142 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2009 equity in losses of Clearwire include a pre tax dilution loss of $154 million ($96 million after tax) recognized in the first quarter 2009, representing the finaliz ation of ownership percentages associated with the formation of Clearwire, which was subject to change based on the trading price of Clearwire stock during the 90 days subsequent to the November 2008 closing. Clearwire owns and operates a next generation mobile broadband network that provides high speed residential and mobile internet access services and residential voice services in communities throughout the country. Clearwire is an early stage company, and as such, has heavily invested in building its network and acquiring other assets necessary to expand the business during 2009 and 2010, which has resulted in increased operating losses and reduced liquidity. We expect Clearwire to continue to generate significant net losses in the near term as it executes its business plan.Other income, net The following table provides additional information of items included in Other income, net for each of the three years ended December 31, 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions)Interest income$35 $34 $97 Realized loss from investments(3) (29) (24)Gain on previously held non controlling interest in Virgin Mobile&mdash; 151 &mdash; Other14 1 16 Total$46 $157 $89 Interest income remained relatively stable in 2010, as compared to 2009. Interest income decreased $63 million, or 65%, in 2009 as co mpared to 2008, primarily due to lower interest rates. Realized loss from investments decreased $26 million, or 90%, in 2010, as compared to 2009 primarily due to fewer sales of marketable securities. As a result of the acquisition of Virgin Mobile, a non cash gain of $151 million ($92 million after tax) was recognized in the fourth quarter 2009 related to the estimated fair value over net carrying value of our previously held non controlling interest in Virgin Mobile. Income Tax (Expense) Benefit The consolidat ed effective tax rate was an expense of approximately 5% in 2010 and a benefit of approximately 30% and 31% in 2009 and 2008, res pectively. The income tax expense for 2010 and the benefit for 2009 include a $1.4 billion and $281 million net increase to the valuation allowance for federal and state deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards generated during the periods. We do not expect to record significant tax benefits on future net operating losses until our circumstances justify the recognition of such benefits. The 2008 income tax benefit includes $278 million related to non cash goodwill impairment as substantially all of the charges are not separately deductible for tax purposes. Additional information related to items impacting the effective tax rates can be found in note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Earnings Wireless Wireless segment earnings are primarily a function of wireless service revenue, costs to acquire subscribers, network and interconnection costs to serve those subscribers and other Wireless segment operating expenses. The costs to acquire our subscribers include the net cost at which we sell our devices, referred to as subsidies, as well as the marketing and sales costs incurred to attract those subscribers. Network costs primarily represent switch and cell site costs and interconnection costs, which generally consist of per minute usage fees and roaming fees paid to other carriers. The remaining costs associated with operating the Wireless segment include the costs to operate our customer care organization and administrative support. Wireless service revenue, costs to acquire subscribers, and variable network and interconnection costs fluctuate with the changes in our subscriber base and their related usage, but some cost elements do not fluctuate in the short term with these changes. The following table provides an overview of the results of operations of our Wireless segment for each of the three years ended December 31, 2010. 28Table of Contents Year Ended December 31,Wireless Earnings2010 2009 2008 (in millions)Postpaid$21,921 $23,205 $25,994 Prepaid3,756 2,081 1,498 Retail service revenue25,677 25,286 27,492 Wholesale, affiliate and other revenue217 546 943 Total service revenue25,894 25,832 28,435 Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)(8,288) (8,384) (8,745)Service gross margin17,606 17,448 19,690 Service gross margin percentage68 % 68 % 69 %Equipment revenue2,703 1,954 1,992 Cost of products(6,965) (5,545) (4,859)Equipment net subsidy(4,262) (3,591) (2,867)Equipment net subsidy percentage(158)% (184)% (144)%Selling, general and administrative expense(8,813) (8,659) (10,047)Wireless segment earnings$4,531 $5,198 $6,776 Service Revenue Our Wireless segment generates revenues from the sale of wireless services, the sale of wireless devices and accessories and the sale of wholesale and other services. Service revenue consists of fixed monthly recurring charges, variable usage charges and miscellaneous fees such as activation fees, director y assistance, roaming, equipment protection, late payment and early termination charges and certain regulatory related fees, net of service credits. The ability of our Wireless segment to generate service revenues is primarily a function of: &bull; revenue generated from each subscriber, which in turn is a function of the types and amount of services utilized by each subscriber and the rates charged for those services; and&bull; the number of subscribers that we serve, which in turn is a function of our ability to acquire new and retain existing subscribers.Retail comprises those subscribers to whom Sprint directly provides wireless services on our networks or networks we utilize through MVNO relationships, such as our relationship with Clearwire, whether those services are provided on a postpaid or a prepaid basis. Retail service revenue increased $391 million, or 2%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 and decreased $2.2 billion, or 8% in 2009 as compared to 2008. The increase in retail service revenue was primarily driven by attracting subscribers to the Companys National Boost Monthly Unlimited prepaid plan in addition to service revenue related to the subscribers acquired through our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions of Virgin Mobile and iPCS. This increase in retail service revenue was partially offset by a decrease in postpaid service revenue driven by a reduction in the Companys average number of postpaid subscribers of approximately 1.4 million, or 4%, in 201 0 as compared to 2009. The majority of the decline in 2009 as compared to 2008 is primarily due to a decrease in postpaid service revenue driven by a reduction in the Companys average number of postpaid subscribers of approximately 4.1 million, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 partially offset by an increase in prepaid revenue primarily driven by attracting subscribers to the Companys National Boost Monthly Unlimited prepaid plan. Wholesale and affiliates are those subscribers who are served through MVNO and affiliate relationships, such as our relationship with Clearwire, and other arrangements through which wireless services are sold by Sprint to other companies that resell those services to subscribers. Wholesale, affiliate and other revenues, in total, decreased $329 million, or 60%, for 2010 as compared to 2009, and $397 million, or 42%, for 2009 as compared to 2008. The majority of the decrease in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to the transfer of 5.4 million subscribers from wholesale and affiliates into postpaid and prepaid classifications as a result of the fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions of Virg in Mobile and iPCS. The remaining decline in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to losses from two of our large MVNOs throughout 2009 in addition to lower revenues received from services provided through our machine to machine initiative. The decrease in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to losses from two of our large MVNOs during 2009. Approximately 41% of our wholesale and affiliate subscribers represent a growing number of devices that utilize our network under our machine to machine initiative. These devices generate revenue from non contract usage which varies depending on the machine to machine service being utilized. Average revenue per subscriber for our open device machine to machine services is generally significantly lower than revenue from other wholesale and affiliate subscribers; however, the cost to service these customers is also lower resulting in a higher profit margin as a percent of revenue.29Table of ContentsAverage Monthly Service Revenue per Subscriber and Subscriber Trends The table below summarizes average number of retail subscribers and average revenue per subscriber for the years ended December 31, 201 0, 2009 and 2008. Additional information about the number of subscribers, net additions to subscribers, average monthly service revenue per subscriber and average rates of monthly postpaid and prepaid customer churn for each quarter since the first quarter 2008 may be found in the table on the following page.

Average subscribers for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are inclusive of prepaid and postpaid subscribers acquired through our 2009 business combinations of Virgin Mobile and iPCS, which were previously included within wholesale and affiliate subscribers. In addition, average prepaid subscribers for the same periods are exclusive of 49,000 subscribers transferred to wholesale and affiliates as a result of a sale and transfer of customers to an affiliate in 2010. (2) Average monthly service revenue per subscriber is calculated by dividing service revenue by the sum of the average number of subscribers. Changes in average monthly service revenue reflect subscribers who change rate plans, the level of voice and data usage, the amount of service credits which are offered to subscribers, plus the net effect of average monthly revenue generated by new subscribers and deactivating subscribers. Average monthly postpaid service revenue per subscriber for 2010 declined slightly as compared to 2009 due to declines in overage revenues resulting from the increased popularity of fixed rate bundled plans including the Any Mobile AnytimeSM feature. Average monthly retail postpaid service revenue per subscriber was stable for 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of improved retention of higher revenue subscribers on bundled rate plans offset by lower overage and roaming revenues. Average monthly prepaid service revenue per subscriber for 2010 decreased compared to 2009 due to prepaid subscribers acquired in our fourth quarter 2009 business combination of Virgin Mobile as well as net subscriber additions under our Assurance Wireless brand launched in early 2010, which carry a lower average revenue per subscriber compared to Sprints other prepaid subscribers. Average monthly prepaid service revenue per subscriber increased during 2009 as compared to 2008 due to higher revenue from our National Boost Monthly Unlimited users combined with more stable average revenue per subscriber from our traditional prepaid users. The lower prepaid average revenue per subscriber and the increased weighting of average prepaid subscribers to total subscribers resulted in a decline in our average retail service revenue per subscriber for 2010 compared to 2009.&nb sp;30Table of ContentsThe following table shows (a) net additions (losses) of wireless subscribers for the past twelve quarters, excluding subscribers obtained through business combinations, (b) our total subscribers as of the end of each quarterly period, (c) our average monthly post paid and prepaid service revenue per subscriber, and (d) our average rates of monthly postpaid and prepaid customer churn for the past twelve quarters.

This change in presentation of previously reported amounts had no effect on total retail postpaid net additions or other subscriber related performance metrics in any prior periods and better reflects Sprints trend of subscriber activity by network technology. (2) Includes subscribers with PowerSource devices, which operate seamlessly between our CDMA and iDEN networks. (3) In the first quarter 2009, Boost Monthly Unlimited was launched on iDEN. In the first quarter 2010, Boost Monthly Unlimited was launched on CDMA.(4) Reflects the transfer of 4,539,000 Prepaid and 835,000 Postpaid subscribers from Wholesale and affiliates as a result of the business combinations completed in the fourth quarter 2009 as well as the third quarter 2010 transfer of 49,000 Wholesale and affiliates subscribers from Prepaid as a result of a sale and transfer of customers to an affiliate. (5) Churn is calculated by dividing net subscriber deactivations for the quarter by the sum of the average number of subscribers for each month in the quarter. For postpaid accounts comprising multiple subscribers, such as family plans and enterprise accounts, net deactivations are defined as deactivations in excess of customer activations in a particular account within 30 days. Postpaid and Prepaid churn consist of both voluntary churn, where the subscriber makes his or her own determination to cease being a customer, and involuntary churn, where the customers service is terminated due to a lack of payment or other reasons. 31Table of ContentsRetail Postpaid Subscribers&mdash;We lost 855,000 net postpaid subscribers during 2010 as compared to losing 3.5 million and 4.1 million net postpaid subscribers during 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our improvement in net postpaid subscriber losses year over year can be attributed to our impro vements in retail postpaid gross adds and lower postpaid churn resulting from simplified and value driven bundled offers, a more competitive device line up, as well as our continued improvements in overall customer experience and customer care satisfaction. Retail Prepaid Subscribers&mdash;We added approximately 1.6 million net prepaid subscribers during 2010 as compared to adding 2.6 million and losing 981,000 net prepaid subscribers in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our net prepaid subscriber additions in 2010 were principally driven by net additions from the Assurance Wireless and Boost Mobile brands, partially offset by net losses associated with the Virgin Mobile brand including a transfer of 49,000 subscribers from prepaid to wholesale and affiliates as a result of a sale and transfer of customers to an affiliate. Our net prepaid subscriber additions in 2009 as compared to losses in 2008 were principa lly driven by the Boost Monthly Unlimited plan. Prepaid subscribers are generally deactivated between 60 days and up to 150 days from the date of activation or replenishment; however, prior to account deactivation, targeted retention programs can be offered to qualifying subscribers to maintain ongoing service by providing up to an additional 150 days to make a replenishment. Subscribers targeted through these retention offers are not included in the calculation of churn until their retention offer expires without a replenishment to their account. As a result, end of period prepaid subscribers include subscribers engaged in these retention programs. Retention offers to these targeted subscribers remained consistent as a percentage of our total prepaid subscriber base during 2010. Wholesale and Affiliate Subscribers&mdash;Wholesale and affiliate subscribers represent customers that are served on our networks through companies that resell our services to their subscribers, customers residing in affiliate territories and a growing portion of subscribers from our machine to machine initiative primarily representing devices that utilize our network. During 2010, wholesale and affiliate subscriber additions were 994,000 resulting in approximately 4.5 million wholesale and affiliate subscribers a s of December 31, 2010, compared to approximately 3.5 million and 9.0 million wholesale and affiliate subscribers as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in the wholesale subscriber base was primarily due to subscriber additions in other MVNO relations hips during 2010. The decrease from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to subscribers transferred to postpaid and prepaid as result of the fourth quarter 2009 business combinations of Virgin Mobile and iPCS. Of the remaining 4.5 million subscribers included in wholesale and affiliate, approximately 41% represent machine to machine activities such as e readers, in vehicle devices and telematics. Subscribers through some of our MVNO relationships have inactivity either in voice usage or primarily as a result of the nature of the device, where activity only occurs when data retrieval is initiated by the end user and may occur infrequently. Although we continue to provide these customers access to our network through our MVNO relationships, approximately 959,000 subscribers through these MVNO relationships have been inactive for at least six months, with no associated r evenue. Cost of Services Cost of services consists primarily of:&bull; costs to operate and maintain our CDMA and iDEN networks, including direct switch and cell site costs, such as rent, utilities, maintenance, labor costs associated with network employees and spectrum frequency leasing costs; &bull; fixed and variable interconnection costs, the fixed component of which consists of monthly flat rate fees for facilities leased from local exchange carriers based on the number of cell sites and switches in service in a particular period and the related equipment installed at each site, and the variable component of which generally consists of per minute use fees charged by wireline provider s for calls terminating on their networks, which fluctuate in relation to the level and duration of those terminating calls;&bull; long distance costs paid to the Wireline segment;&bull; &nb sp;costs to service and repair devices;&bull; regulatory fees;&bull; &n bsp;roaming fees paid to other carriers; and &bull; fixed and variable costs relating to payments to third parties for the use of their proprietary data applications, such as messaging, music, TV and navigation services by our subscribers.Cost of services decreased $96 million, or 1%, in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily reflecting a decline in service and repair costs by focusing on device repairs and refurbishment rather than utilizing new devices, a decline in long distance network costs as a result of lower market rates as well as a decline in payments to third party vendors providing premium services as a result of changing from usage based payments to flat r ates. This decline was partially offset by increased roaming due to higher data usage and an increase in license fees as a result of the continued growth in smartphone devices, which carry higher fees. Cost of services decreased $361 million, or 4%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily reflecting a decline in labor, outside services and maintenance costs consistent with the Companys cost cutting efforts, as well as a decl ine in network costs associated with fewer subscribers.32Table of ContentsEquipment Net Subsidy We recognize equipment revenue and corresponding costs of devices when title of the device passes to the dealer or end user cu stomer. Our marketing plans assume that devices typically will be sold at prices below cost, which is consistent with industry practice, as subscriber retention efforts often include providing incentives to subscribers such as offering new devices at discounted prices. We reduce equipment revenue for these discounts offered directly to the customer, or for certain payments to third party dealers to reimburse the dealer for point of sale discounts that are offered to the end user subscriber. Additionally, the cost of devices is reduced by any rebates that are earned from the supplier. Cost of devices and accessories also includes order fulfillment related expenses and write downs of device and related accessory inventory for shrinkage and obsolescence. Equipment cost in excess of the revenue generated from equipment sales is referred to in the industry as equipment net subsidy. Equipment revenue increased $749 million, or 38%, in 2010 compared to 2009 and cost of devices increased $1.4 billion, or 26%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in both equipment revenue and cost of devices is primarily due to an increase in the number of postpaid devices sold with a greater mix of devices that have a higher average sales price and cost, as well as an increase in the number of prepaid devices sold. Equipment revenue decreased $38 million, or 2%, in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to declining average sales prices for devices with higher functionality as a result of competitive and economic pressures, partially offset by an increase in the number of lower priced prepaid devices sold in 2009 as compared to 2008. Cost of devices increased $699 million, or 15%, in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to our mix of devices sold reflecting a greater mix of postpaid devices sold with a higher functionality and an increase in the number of devices sold.Selling, General and Administrative Expense Sales and marketing costs primarily consist of customer acquisition costs, including commissions paid to our indirect dealers, third party distributors and retail sales force for new device activations and upgrades, residual payments to our indirect dealers, payroll and facilities costs associated with our retail sales force, marketing employees, advertising, media programs and sponsorships, including costs related to branding. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for billing, customer care and information technology operations, bad debt expense and administrative support activities, including collections, legal, finance, human resources, strategic planning and technology and product development. Sales and marketing expense increased $322 million, or 7%, in 2010 from 2009 as compared to a decrease of $273 million, or 6%, in 2009 from 2008. The increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily due to the additional costs associated with our increase in subscriber gross additions combined with incremental costs associated with our business combinations in the fourth quarter 2009, offset by a decline in marketing expenditures related to our cost cutting initiatives. The decline in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily due to a decline in gross subscriber additions compared to 2008 and a decline in labor related c osts due to our workforce and cost reduction activities. General and administrative costs decreased $203 million, or 5%, in 2010 from 2009 and $1.1 billion, or 22%, in 2009 from 2008. The decline in general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2010 reflects a reduction in customer care costs and minor continued effects of workforce reductions and cost cutting initiatives announced in 2009 offset by increases as a result of the fourth quarter 2009 business combinations of Virgin Mobile and iPCS in addition to an increase in bad debt expense. The decline in general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily due to reductions in customer care costs, the decrease in employee related costs as part of our cost cutting initiatives and lower bad debt expense. Customer care costs decreased $87 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 and $363 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. The improvement in customer care costs is largely attributable to customer care quality initiatives launched in 2008 that have resulted in a reduction in calls per subscriber by 39% f rom 2007 peak levels which allowed for a reduction of 19 call centers in 2009 and 11 call centers in 2008. Employee related costs in 2010 were consistent with 2009 and costs decreased approximately $536 million in 2009 as compared to 2008, due to workforce reductions announced in January and November 2009. Bad debt expense was $423 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 representing a $31 million increase, as compared to bad debt expense of $392 million in 2009. The increase in bad debt expense primarily reflects 2009 reductions in allowances for bad debt due to increased rates of recovery. For the year ended December 31, 2009, bad debt expense decreased $240 million as compared to bad debt expense of $632 million in 2008. The improvement in bad debt expense resulted from lower rates of uncollectibility during the period, as well a s lower estimated uncollectible accounts in outstanding accounts receivable. We reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly. Changes in our allowance for doubtful accounts are largely attributable to credit policies established for subscribers and analysis of historical collection experience. Our mix of prime postpaid subscribers to total postpaid subscribers remained flat at 84% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 33Table of ContentsSegment Earnings Wireline Wireline segment earnings are primarily a function of wireline service revenue, network and interconnection costs and other Wireline segment operating expenses. Network costs primarily represent special access costs and interconnection costs which generally consist of domestic and international per minute usage fees paid to other carriers. The remaining costs associated with operating the Wireline segment include the costs to operate our customer care and billing organizations in addition to administrative support. Wireline service revenue, and variable network and interconnection costs fluctuate with the changes in our customer base and their related usage, but some cost elements do not fluctuate in the short term with the changes in our customer usage. Our wireline services provided to our Wireless segment are generally accounted for based on market rates which we believe approximate fair value. The Company generally re establishes these rates at the beginning of each fiscal year. Over the past several years, there has been an industry wide trend of lower rates due to increased competition from other wireline and wireless communications companies as well as cable and internet service providers. For 2011, we expect wireline service gross margin to decline by approximately $200 to $250 million to reflect changes in market prices for services provided by our Wireline segment to our Wireless segment. This decline in wireline service gross margin related to intercompany pricing will not affect Sprints consolidated results of operations as our Wireless segme nt will benefit from an equivalent reduction in cost of service. The following table provides an overview of the results of operations of our Wireline segment for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.  Year Ended December 31,Wireline Earnings2010 2009 2008 (in millions)Voice$2,249 $2,563 $3,079 Data519 662 959 Internet2,175 2,293 2,148 Other97 111 146 Total net service revenue5,040 5,629 6,332 Cost of services and products(3,319) (3,663) (4,192)Service gross margin1,721 1,966 2,140 Service gross margin percentage34% 35% 34%Selling, general and administrative expense(631) (745) (965)Wireline segment earnings$1,090 $1,221 $1,175 Wireline Revenue Voice Revenues Voice revenues decreased $314 million, or 12%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 and decreased $516 million, or 17%, in 2009 as compared to 2008. The 2010 and 2009 decreases were primarily driven by volume declines due to customer churn as well as overall price declines. Voice revenues generated from the sale of services to our Wireless segment represented 33% of total voice revenues in 2010 as compared to 31% in 2009 and 26% in 2008. Data Revenues Data revenues reflect sales of data services, including ATM, frame relay and managed network services. Data revenues decreased $143 million, or 22%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 and decreased $297 million, or 31%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to declines in frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) services as subscribers migrated to IP based technologies. Data revenues generated from the provision of services to the Wireless segment represented 27% of total data revenue in 2010 as compared to 19% in 2009 and 13% in 2008. Internet Revenues Internet revenues reflect sales of IP based data services, including MPLS, VoIP and SIP. Internet revenues decreased $118 million, or 5%, in 2010 from 2009 as compared to an increase of $145 million, or 7%, in 2009 from 2008. The 2010 decrease was due to a decline in new IP customers with lower market rates as a result of increased competition. The 2009 increase was due to higher IP revenues as business subscribers were increasing requirements to support wireless customers data traffic, in addition to revenue growth in cable VoIP, which experienced a 15% increase in subscribers in 2009 as compared to 2008. Internet revenues generated from the provision of services to the Wireless segment represented 10% of total Internet revenues in 2010 as compared to 11% in 2009 and 9% in 2008. Some MSOs are in the process of in sourcing their digital voice products for which the transition and associated revenue reductions will occur over the next several years with a decrease of approximately $200 million to occur in 2011. 34Table of ContentsOther Revenues Other revenues, which primarily consist of sales of customer premises equipment (CPE), decreased $14 million, or 13% in 2010 as compared to 2009 and $35 million, or 24%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 as a result of fewer projects in 2010 and 2009. Costs of Services and Products Costs of services and products include access costs paid to local phone companies, other domestic service providers and foreign phone companies to complete calls made by our domestic subscribers, costs to operate and maintain our networks and costs of equipment. Costs of services and products decreased $344 million, or 9%, in 2010 from 2009 and $529 million, or 13%, in 2009 from 2008. The decrease in 2010 and 2009 is primarily due to declining voice volumes and a shift in mix to lower cost products as a result of the migration from data to IP based technologies. Service gross margin percentage increased from 34% in 2008 to 35% in 2009 and decreased back to 34% in 2010. The increase from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to revenue growth in our cable VoIP business and a decrease in costs of services and products offset by a decrease in voice revenue. The decrease from 2009 to 2010 was as a result of a decrease in net service revenue offset by a decrease in costs of services and products.Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $114 million, or 15%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 and $220 million, or 23% in 2009 as compared 2008. The decreases were primarily due to a reduction in employee headcount and a decline in the use of outside services and maintenance as part of our cost cutting initiatives. Total selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net services revenue was 13% in 2010 and 2009 and 15% in 2008. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow  Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$4,815 $4,891 $6,179 Net cash used in investing activities(2,556) (3,844) (4,250)Net cash used in financing activities(905) (919) (484)Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $4.8 billion in 2010 decreased $76 million from the same period in 2009 primarily due to a $196 million decrease in cash received from our subscribers resulting from a decline in our postpaid subscriber customer base, an increase of $217 million in cash paid to our suppliers and employees, and an increase of $36 million in cash paid for interest. These were partially offset by an increase of $170 million in cash received for income tax refunds. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2009 also includes a cash payment of $200 million resulting from a contr ibution to the Company pension plan. Net cash provided by operating activities of $4.9 billion in 2009 decreased by $1.3 billion from 2008, primarily due to a $3.6 billion decrease in cash received from our subscribers as a result of declining service revenues from our loss of post paid subscribers and a $200 million contribution to the Company pension plan during 2009. These declines were offset by a decrease of $2.1 billion in cash paid to our suppliers and employees primarily due to reductions in variable cost of services and products and selling, general and administrative expenses due to the various cost cutting initiatives implemented over the past year. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2008 is net of cash used for operating activities of approximately $300 million that related to our operations that were contributed to Clearwire in November 2008.Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for 2010 decreased by $1.3 billion from 2009, due to a decrease of $300 million in purchases of short term investments and a decrease of $132 million in expenditures related to FCC licenses as determined by specific operations requirements of the Report and Order. These decreases were partially offset by reduced proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments of $418 million and increased capital exp enditures of $332 million to add coverage and capacity to our wireless networks. Sprint also increased its investment in Clearwire by $1.1 billion and acquired iPCS and Virgin Mobile for $560 million in 2009, which resulted in the remaining decline in 2010 as compared to 2009. Net cash used in investing activities for 2009 decreased by $406 million from 2008, primarily due to an increase of $369 million in proceeds from short term investments and a decrease in capital expenditures of $2.3 billion in 2009 as 35Table of Contentscompared to 2008 mainly due to fewer cell sites built in 2009, fewer IT and network development projects and costs incurred related to the build up of WiMAX in 2008 that are no longer being incurred in 2009 due to the close of the transaction with Clearwire in November 2008. The decreases were offset by increased purc hases of $599 million in short term investments, a $1.1 billion increase of Sprints investment in Clearwire and $560 million used to acquire Virgin Mobile and iPCS in the fourth quarter 2009. Net cash used in investing activities for 2008 include expenditures of approximately $600 million related to capital assets and FCC licenses that were contributed to Clearwire in November 2008.Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $905 million during 2010 compared to net cash used by financing activities of $919 million in 2009. Activities in 2010 included a $750 million debt payment in June 2010 and a $51 million payment for debt financing costs associated with our new revolving credit facility. In addition, in the fourth quarter 2010, we exercised an option to terminate our relationship with a variable interest entity, which resulted in the repayment of financing, capital lease and other obligations of $105 million.Net cash used in financing activities was $919 million during 2009 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $484 million in 2008. Activities in 2009 include debt repayments of $600 million of senior notes in May 2009, the early redemption of $607 million of our convertible senior notes in September 2009, and a $1.0 billion payment on our revolving bank credit facility in November 2009 offset by the issuance of $1.3 billion of senior notes in August 2009. Net cash used in financing activities was $484 million during 2008. Activities in 2008 include the draw down of $2.5 billion under our revolving bank credit facility in February 2008, the net proceeds from the financing obligation with TowerCo Acquisition LLC related to a sale and subsequent leaseback of multiple tower locations in September 2008 of $645 million, and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper of $681 million, offset by the early redemption of $1.25 billion of our senior notes in June 2008, the extinguishment in September 2008 of $235 million of US Unwired Inc.s 10% Second Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2012, the extinguishment in September 2008 of $250 million of Alamosa (Delaware), Inc.s 8.5% Senior Notes due 2012, the repayment of $1.5 billion of our revolving bank credit facility in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 and maturities of commercial paper of $1.1 billion.We received $8 million, $4 million and $57 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in proceeds from common share issuances, primarily resulting from exercises of employee options.Liquidity As of December 31, 2010, our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $5.5 billion. On May 21, 2010, we entered into a new $2.1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in October 2013. This new credit facility replaced the $4.5 billion credit facility that was due to expire in December 2010. As of December 31, 2010, $1.4 billion in letters of credit, including a $1.3 billion letter of credit required by the Report and Order to reconfigure the 800 MHz band, were outstanding under our $2.1 billion revolving bank credit facility. As a result of the outstanding letters of credit, which directly reduce the availability of the revolving bank credit facility, we had $700 million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving bank credit facility as of December 31, 2010. Accordingly, Sprints liquidity as of December 31, 2010, including cash, cash equivalents, short term investments and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility was $6.2 billion. In addition, in January 2011, $1.65 billion of Sprint Capital Corporation 7.625% senior notes were repaid upon maturity and we amended $500 million of our $750 million Export Development Canada loan to extend the maturity date from 2012 to 2015.The terms and conditions of our revolving bank credit facility require the ratio of total indeb tedness to trailing four quarters earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other non recurring items, as defined by the credit facility (adjusted EBITDA), to be no more than 4.5 to 1.0. Beginning in April 2012, the ratio will be reduced to 4.25 to 1.0, and further reduced to 4.0 to 1.0 in January 2013. As of December 31, 2010, the ratio was 3.7 to 1.0 as compared to 3.5 to 1.0 as of December 31, 2009 resulting from our decline in adjusted EBITDA. Under this revolving bank credit facility, we are currently restricted from paying cash dividends because our ratio of total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA exceeds 2.5 to 1.0. The terms of the revolving bank credit facility provi de for an interest rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin of between 2.75% and 3.50%, depending on our debt ratings. Certain of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the revolving bank credit facility. A default under our borrowings could trigger defaults under our other debt obligations, which in turn could result in the maturities being accelerated. Certain indentures that govern our outstanding notes also require compliance with various covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness and liens by the Company and its subsidiaries, as defined by the terms of the indentures. As of December 31, 2010, we own a 54% economic interest in Clearwire. As a res ult, Clearwire could be considered a subsidiary under certain agreements relating to our indebtedness. Whether Clearwire could be considered a subsidiary under our debt agreements is subject to interpretation. In December 2010, as a result of an amendment to the Clearwire equityholders agreement, Sprint obtained the right to unilaterally surrender voting securities to reduce its voting security percentage below 50%, which could eliminate the potential for Clearwire to be considered a subsidiary of Sprint. 36Table of ContentsCertain actions or defaults by Clearwire would, if viewed as a subsidiary, result in a breach of covenants, including potential cross default provisions, under certain agreements relating to our indebtedness. However, we believe the unilateral rights obtained in December significantly mitigate the possibility of an event that would cross default against Sprints debt obligations. We expect to remain in compliance with our covenants through at least the end of 2012, although there can be no assurance that we will do so. Although we expect to improve our postpaid subscriber results, if we do not meet our plan, depending on the severity of the actual subscriber results versus what we currently anticipate, it is possible that we would not remain in compliance w ith our covenants or be able to meet our debt service obligations, which could result in acceleration of our indebtedness. If such unforeseen events occur, we may engage with our lenders to obtain appropriate waivers or amendments of our credit facilities or refinance borrowings, although there is no assurance we would be successful in any of these actions. Sprints current liquidity position makes it likely that we will be able to meet our debt service requirements and other funding needs currently identified through at least the end of 2012 by using our anticipated cash flows from operating activities as well as our cash and cash equivalents on hand. In addition, we also have available the remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving bank credit facility. Nevertheless, if we are unable to continue to reduce the rate of losses of postpaid subscribe rs, it could have a significant negative impact on cash provided by operating activities and our liquidity in future years. In determining that we expect to meet our funding needs through at least 2012, we have considered: &bull; expenses relating to our operations; &bull; anticipated levels of capital expenditures, including the capacity and upgrading of our networks and the deployment of new technologies in our networks, and FCC license acquisitions; &bull; antic ipated payments under the Report and Order, as supplemented; &bull; any contributions we may make to our pension plan; &bull; scheduled debt service requirements; &bull; any additional investment we may choose to make in Clearwire; and &bull; other future contractual obligations and general corporate expenditures. Any of these events or circumstances could involve significant additional funding needs in excess of anticipated cash flows from operating activities and the identified currently available funding sources, including existing cash and cash equivalents and borrowings available under our existing revolving credit facility. If existing capital resources are not sufficient to meet these funding needs, it would be necessary to raise additional capital to meet those needs. Our ability to fund our capital needs from outside sources is ultimately affected by the overall capacity and terms of the banking and securities markets, as well as our performance and our credit ratings. Given our recent financial performance as well as the volatility in these markets, we continue to monitor them closely and to take steps to maintain financial flexibility and a reasonable cost of capital. As of December 31, 2010, Moodys Investor Service, Standard & Poors Ratings Services, and Fitch Ratings had assigned the following credit ratings to certain of our outstanding obligations:  Rating Rating Agency Senior UnsecuredBank CreditFacility SeniorUnsecured Debt OutlookMoodys Baa2 Ba3 Under ReviewStandard and Poors Not&nbsp ;Rated BB NegativeFitch BB BB  NegativeDowngrades of our current ratings do not accelerate scheduled principal payments of our existing debt. However, downgrades may cause us to incur higher interest costs on our credit facilities and future borrowings, if any, and could negatively impact our access to the public capital markets. As of December 31, 2010, we had working capital of $2.0 billion compared to $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2009. 37Table of ContentsCURRENT BUSINESS OUTLOOK We endeavor to both add new and retain our existing wireless subscribers in order to reverse the net loss in postpaid wireless subscribers that we have experienced. We expect to improve our subscriber trends by continuing to improve the customer experience and through offers which provide value, simplicity and productivity. Given the current economic environment, the difficulties the economic uncertainties create in forecasting, as well as the inherent uncertainties in predicting future customer behavior, we are unable to forecast with assurance the net retail postpaid subscriber results we will experience during 2011 or thereafter. However, the Company expects postpaid subscriber net additions for the full year 2011 and to improve total wireless subscriber net additions in 2011, as compared to 2010. Our net subscriber losses have significantly reduced our revenue and opera ting cash flow. These effects will continue if we do not continue to attract new subscribers and or reduce our rate of churn. See Effects on our Wireless Business of Postpaid Subscriber Losses above for a discussion of how our subscriber trends will impact our segment earnings trends. Also, subscriber losses will further decrease our adjusted EBITDA, as defined by our revolving bank credit facility. Management implemented cost reduction programs designed to decrease our cost structure by reducing our labor and other costs; however, we do not expect that the reduction in costs will fully offset the revenue declines described above. The above discussion is subject to the risks and other cautionary and qualifying factors set forth under &mdash;Forward Looking Statements and Part I, I tem 1A Risk Factors in this report. 38Table of Contents FUTURE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments as of December 31, 2010. Future events, including additional purchases of our securities and refinancing of those securities, could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts. See &mdash;Forward Looking Statements. Future Contractual Obligations Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 andthereafter (in millions)Senior notes, bank credit facilities and debentures(1) $30,586 $2,969 $3,914 $2,831 $2,261 $3,007 $15,604 Capital leases and financing obligation(2) 1,748 84 86 87 82 82 1,327 Operating leases(3) 13,392 1,694  1,705 1,576 1,415 1,136 5,866 Purchase orders and other commitments(4) 11,788 7,166 1,925 1,227&nb sp; 589 326 555 Total $57,514 $11,913 $7,630 $5,721 $4,347 $4,551 $23,352 (1) Includes principal and estimated interest payments. Interest payments are based on managements expectations for future interest rates. In January 2011, $500 million of our $750 million Export Development Canada loan was amended to extend the maturity date from 2012 to 2015, which is not reflected in the table above.(2) Represents capital lease payments including interest and financing obligation related to the sale and subsequent leaseback of multiple tower sites. (3) Includes future lease costs related to cell and switch sites, real estate, network equipment and office space. (4) Includes service, spectrum, network capacity and other executory contracts. Excludes blanket purchase orders in the amount of $44 million. See below for further discussion. Purchase orders and other commitments include m inimum purchases we commit to purchase from suppliers over time and or the unconditional purchase obligations where we guarantee to make a minimum payment to suppliers for goods and services regardless of whether suppliers fully deliver them. Amounts actually paid under some of these other agreements will likely be higher due to variable components of these agreements. The more significant variable components that determine the ultimate obligation owed include hours contracted, subscribers and other factors. In addition, we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and create an obligation to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the delivery of functioning software or products. Because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements, no such amounts have been included in the table above. The table above also excludes about $44 million of blanket purchase order amounts since their agreement terms are not specified. No time frame is set for these purchase orders and they are not legally binding. As a result, they are not firm commitments. Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $228 million as of December 31, 2010. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the timing of the resolution of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular year(s) in the table. The table above does not include remaining costs to be paid in connection with the fulfillment of our obligations under the Report and Order. The Report and Order requires us to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury at the conclusion of the band reconfiguration process to the extent that the value of the 1.9 GHz spectrum we received exceeds the total of the value of licenses for spectrum in the 700 MHz and 800 MHz bands that we surrendered under the decision plus the actual costs, or qualifying costs, that we incur to retune incumbents and our own facilities. The total minimum cash obligation for the Report and Order is $2.8 billion. From the inception of the program through December 31, 2010, we have incurred approximately $2.8 billion of costs directly attributable to the spectrum reconfiguration program. This amount does not include any of our internal network costs that we have preliminarily allocated to the reconfiguration program for capacity sites and modifications for which we may request credit under the reconfiguration program. We estimate, based on our experience to date with the reconfiguration program and on information currently available, that our total direct costs attributable to complete the spectrum reconfigurations will range between $3.4 and $3.7 billion. Accordingly, we believe that it is unlikely that we will be required to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury. OFF BALANCE SHEET FINANCING We do not participate in, or secure, financings for any unconsolidated, special purpose entities. 39Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Sprint applies those accounting policies that management believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Sprints more critical accounting policies include those related to the basis of presentation, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation and recoverability of our equity method investment in Clearwire, valuation and recoverability of long lived assets, evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived assets for impairment, and accruals for taxes based on income. Inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management. Management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment. These critical accounting policies have been discussed with Sprints Board of Directors. Sprints significant accounting policies are summarized in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Sprint and its consolidated subsidiaries. Investments where Sprint maintains majority ownership, but lacks full decision making ability over all major issues, are accounted for using the equity method. Governa nce for Sprints major unconsolidated investment, Clearwire, is based on Clearwire board representation for which Sprint does not have a majority vote. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from failure of our subscribers to make required payments. Our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts considers a number of factors, including collection experience, aging of the accounts receivable portfolios, credit quality of the subscriber base, estimated proceeds from future bad debt sales and other qualitative considerations. To the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends, the required allowance amounts could differ from our estimate. A 10% change in the amount estimated to be uncollectible would result in a corresponding change in bad debt expense of about $19 million for the Wireless segment and $1 million for the Wireline segment. Valuation and Recoverability of our Equity Method Investment in Clearwire We assess our equity method investment for other than temporary impairment when indicators such as decline in quoted prices in active markets indicate a value below the carrying value of our investment. This evaluation requires significant judgment regarding, but not limited to, the severity and duration of decline in market prices; the ability and intent to hold the securities until recovery; financial condition, liquidity, and near term prospects of the issuer, specific events, and other factors. Sprints assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to changes in facts and circumstances. Sprint owns a 54% ownership interest in Clearwire for which the carrying value as of December 31, 2010 was $3.1 billion while the value of such investment based on Clearwires closing stock price was $2.7 billion. Sprints ability to recover the carrying value of its investment depends, in part, upon Clearwires ability to obtain sufficient funding to support its operations and its ability to successfully develop, deploy, and maintain its 4G network. A decline in the estimated fair value of Clearwire that would be deemed to be other than temporary could result in a material impairment to the carrying value of our investment. We do not intend to sell our 54% economic interest in the foreseeable future, and recoverability of our equity investment is not affected by short term fluctuations in Clearwires stock price. Accordingly, we expect to fully recover the carrying value of our investment in Clearwire.Valuation and Recoverability of Long lived Assets Long lived assets consist primarily of property, pl ant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization. Changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets, as well as changes in economic or industry factors or in our business or prospects, may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change. Property, plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated economic useful lives. Certain network assets are depreciated using the group life method. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. When these factors indicate that an assets useful life is different from the previous assess ment, we depreciate the remaining book values prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. Depreciation rates for assets using the group life method are revised periodically as required under this method. Changes made as a result of depreciable life studies and rate changes generally do not have a material effect on depreciation expense. Long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Long lived asset groups were determined based upon certain factors including assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of our assets, a loss is recognized for t he difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the assets. Impairment analyses, when 40Table of Contentsperformed, are based on our current business and technology strategy, views of growth rates for our business, anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability. During 2010, we analyzed long lived assets in our Wireless segment for recoverability and, based on ou r estimate of undiscounted cash flows, determined the carrying value to be recoverable. Our estimate of undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of these assets by more than 10%. If we continue to have operational challenges, including obtaining and retaining subscribers, future cash flows of the Company may not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of our wireless asset group, and we could record asset impairments that are material to Sprints consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In addition to the analyses described above, certain assets that have not yet been deployed in the business, including network equipment, cell site development costs and software in development, are periodically assessed to determine recoverability. Network equipment and cell site development costs are expensed whenever events or changes in circumstances cause the Company to conclude the assets are no longer needed to meet managements strategic network plans and will not be deployed. Software development costs are expensed when it is no longer probable that the software project will be deployed. Network equipment that has been removed from the network is also periodically assessed to determine recoverability. If we continue to have challenges retaining subscribers and as we continue to assess the impact of rebanding the iDEN network, management may conclude in future periods that certain CDMA and iDEN assets will never be either deployed or redeployed, in which case non cash charges that could be material to our consolidated financial statements would be recognized. Evaluation of Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price paid over the fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. Sprint evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed estimated fair value. Our analysis includes a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill applies to the carrying value, including goodwill, of that reporting unit. We regularly assess whether any indicators of impairment exist, which requires a significant amount of judgment. Such indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price a nd market capitalization; a decline in our expected future cash flows; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and or slower growth rates, among others. Any adverse change in these factors could result in an impairment that could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The determination of the estimated fair value of the wireless reporting unit requires significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, transactions within the wireless industry and related control premiums, discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) and capital expenditures forecasts. Due to the inherent uncerta inty involved in making those estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. The merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit are evaluated for reasonableness. FCC licenses and our Sprint and Boost Mobile trademarks have been identified as indefinite lived intangible assets, in addition to goodwill, after considering the expected use of the assets, the regulatory and economic environment within which they are being used, and the effects of obsolescence on their use. When required, Sprint assesses the recoverability of other indefinite lived intangibles, including FCC licenses which are carried as a single unit of accounting. In assessing recoverability of FCC licenses, we estimate the fair value of such licenses using the Greenfield direct value method, w hich approximates value through estimating the discounted future cash flows of a hypothetical start up business. Assumptions key in estimating fair value under this method include, but are not limited to, capital expenditures, subscriber activations and deactivations, market share achieved, tax rates in effect and discount rate. A one percent decline in our assumed revenue growth rate used to estimate terminal value, a one percent decline in our assumed net cash flows or a one percent adverse change in any of the key assumptions referred to above would not result in an impairment of our FCC licenses as of the most recent testing date. A decline in the estimated fair value of FCC licenses of approximately 20% also would not result in an impairment of the carrying value. Accruals for Taxes Based on Income Uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of complex U.S. federal and state tax regulations. Management expects that Sprints interpretations will prevail. Also, Sprint has recognized deferred tax benefits relating to its future utilization of past operating losses. Sprint believes it is more likely than not that the amounts of deferred tax assets in excess of the related valuation allowances will be realized. The accounting estimates related to the tax valuation allowance require us to make assumptions regarding the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. These assumptions require significant judgment because actual performance has fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future. The impact that changes in actual performance versus these estimates could have on the realization of tax benefits as reported in our results of operations could be material. The accounting estimates related to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits require us to make judgments 41Table of Contentsregarding the sustainability of each uncertain tax position based on its technical merits. These estimates are updated based on the facts, circumstances and information available. We are also required to assess at each annual reporting date whether it is reasonably possible that any significant increases or decreases to the unrecognized tax benefits will occur during the next twelve months. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative literature regarding Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), which changes various aspects of accounting for and disclosures of interests in variable interest entities, and Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, which was issued in order to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets; the effects of a transfer on its financial position, financial performance, and cash flows; and a transferors continuing involvement, if any, in transferred financial assets. This guidance was effective beginning in January 2010 and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2009, the FASB modified the accounting for Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements and Certain Revenue Arrangements that Include Software Elements. These modifications alter the methods previously required for allocating consideration received in multiple element arrangements to require revenue allocation based on a relative selling price method, including arrangements containing software components and non software components that function t ogether to deliver the products essential functionality. These modifications will be effective prospectively for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011 and are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, which requires new and amended disclosure requirements for classes of assets and liabilities, inputs and valuation techniques and transfers between levels of fair value measurements and Accounting for Distributions to Shareholders with Components of Stock and Cash, which clarifies the accounting for distributions to shareholders that offer them the ability to elect to receive their entire distribution in cash or shares of equivalent value. This guidance was effective beginning in January 2010 and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.In July 2010, the FASB amended the requirements for Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses. As a result of these amendments, an entity is required to disaggregate by portfolio segment or class certain existing disclosures and provide certain new disclosures about its financing receivables and related allowance for credit losses. Th e new disclosures as of the end of the reporting period are effective for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010, while the disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for the first fiscal quarter of 2011. The disclosure requirements effective for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. The requirements effective for the first fiscal quarter of 2011 are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We include certain estimates, projections and other forward looking statements in our annual, quarterly and current reports, and in other publicly available material. Statements regarding expectations, including performance assumptions and estimates relating to capital requirements, as well as other statements that are not historical facts, are forward looking statements. These statements reflect managements judgments based on currently available information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements. With respect to these forward looking statements, management has made assumptions regarding, among other things, subscriber and network usage, subscriber growth and retention, pricing, operating costs, the timing of various events and the economic a nd regulatory environment. Future performance cannot be assured. Actual results may differ materially from those in the forward looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include:&bull; our ability to attract and retain subscribers;&bull; the ability of our competitors to offer products and services at lower prices due to lower cost structures;&bull; the effects of vigorous competition on a highly penetrated market, including the imp act of competition on the price we are able to charge subscribers for services and equipment we provide and our ability to attract new subscribers and retain existing subscribers; the overall demand for our service offerings, including the impact of decisions of new or existing subscribers between our postpaid and prepaid services offerings and between our two network platforms; and the impact of new, emerging and competing technologies on our business;&bull; the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to fully implement our network mode rnization plan to improve and enhance our networks and service offerings, implement our business strategies and provide competitive new 42Table of Contentstechnologies;&bull; the effective implementation of our network modernization plan, Network Vision, including timing, technologies, and costs;&bull; changes in available technology and the effects of such changes, including product substitutions and deployment costs;&bull; our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all; &bull; volatility in the trading price of our comm on stock, current economic conditions and our ability to access capital;&bull; the impact of unrelated parties not meeting our business requirements, including a significant adverse change in the ability or willingness of such parties to provide devices or infrastructure equipment for our CDMA network, or Motorolas ability or willingness to provide related devices, infrastructure equipment and software applications for our iDEN network;&bull; the costs and business risks associated with providing new services and entering new geographic markets; &bull; the financial performance of Clearwire and its de ployment of a 4G network;&bull; the impact of difficulties we may encounter in connection with the continued integration of the business and assets of Virgin Mobile, including the risk that these difficulties may limit our ability to fully integrate the operations of this business; &bull; the effects of mergers and consolidations and new entrants in the communications industry and unexpected announcements or developments from others in the communications industry; &bull; unexpected results of litigation filed against us or our suppliers or vendors;&bull; the impact of adverse network performance;&bull; the costs or potential customer impacts of compliance with regul atory mandates including, but not limited to, compliance with the FCCs Report and Order to reconfigure the 800 MHz band;&bull; equipment failure, natural disasters, terrorist acts or other breaches of network or information technology security;&bull; one or more of the markets in which we compete being impacted by changes in political, economic or other factors such as monetary policy, legal and regulatory changes or other external factors over which we have no control; and &bull; other risks referenced from time to time in this report, including in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors and other filings of ours with the SEC.The words may, could, estimate, project, forecast, intend, expect, believe, target, plan, providing guidance and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are found throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and elsewhere in this report. Readers are cautioned that other factors, although not listed above, could also materially affect our future performance and operating results. The reader should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We are not obligated to publicl y release any revisions to forward looking statements to reflect events after the date of this report, including unforeseen events. FINANCIAL STRATEGIES General Risk Management Policies Our board of directors has adopted a financial risk management policy that authorizes us to enter into derivative transactions, and all transactions comply with the policy. We do not purchase or ho ld any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes with the exception of equity rights obtained in connection with commercial agreements or strategic investments, usually in the form of warrants to purchase common shares. Derivative instruments are primarily used for hedging and risk management purposes. Hedging activities may be done for various purposes, including, but not limited to, mitigating the risks associated with an asset, liability, committed transaction or probable forecasted transaction. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through stringent credit approval and review processes, credit support agreements, continual review and monitoring of all counterparties, and thorough legal review of contracts. Exposure to market risk is controlled by regularly monitoring changes in hedge positions under normal and stress conditions to ensure they do not exceed established limits. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are primarily exposed to the market risk associated with unfavorable movements in interest rates, f oreign 43Table of Contentscurrencies, and equity prices. The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors. Interest Rate Risk The communications industry is a capital intensive, technology driven business. We are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our borrowings. Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows. Specific interest rate risk includes: the risk of increasing interest rates on floating rate debt and the risk of increasing interest rates for planned new fixed rate long term financings or refinancings. About 86% of our debt as of December 31, 201 0 was fixed rate debt. While changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt, there is no impact to earnings and cash flows because we intend to hold these obligations to maturity unless market and other conditions are favorable. We perform interest rate sensitivity analyses on our variable rate debt. These analyses indicate that a one percentage point change in interest rates would have an annual pre tax impact of $27 million on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2010. We also perform a sensitivity analysis on the fair market value of our outstanding debt. A 10% decline in market interest rates would cause a $751 million increase in the fair market value of our debt to $20.8 billion. Foreign Currency Risk We also enter into forward contracts and options in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. O ur foreign exchange risk management program focuses on reducing transaction exposure to optimize consolidated cash flow. We use foreign currency derivatives to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to settlement of international telecommunications access charges and the operation of our international subsidiaries. The dollar equivalent of our net foreign currency payables from international settlements was $7 million and the net foreign currency receivables from international operations were $4 million as of December 31, 2010. The potential immediate pre tax loss to us that would result from a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates based on these positions would be insignificant. Equity Risk We are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments. We invest in equity instruments of public companies for operational and strategic business purposes. These securities are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to volatility of the stock market and industries in which the companies operate. These securities, which are classified in investments on the consolidated balance sheets, primarily include equity method investments, such as our investment in Clearwire and available for sal e securities. In certain business transactions, we are granted warrants to purchase the securities of other companies at fixed rates. These warrants are supplemental to the terms of the business transaction and are not designated as hedging instruments. 
 
Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Business Strategies and Key Priorities Sprint is a communications company offering a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications products and services that are designed to meet the needs of individual consumers, businesses, government subscribers and resellers. The communications industry has been and will continue to be highly competitive on the basis of price, the types of services and devices offered and the quality of service. As discussed below in Effects on our Wireless Business of Postpaid Subscriber Losses, the Company has experienced significant losses of subscribers in the critical postpaid wireless market since the third quarter 2006, but, as a result of steps taken to attract and retain such subscribers, has reduced net subscriber losses beginning in 2009.Our business strategy is to be responsive to changing customer mobility demands by being innovative and differentiated in the marketplace. Our future growth plans and strategy revolve around achieving the following three key priorities: &bull; Improve the customer experience; &bull; Strengthen our brands; and&bull; Generate operating cash flow. We have reduced confusion over pricing plans and complex bills with our Simply Everything&reg; and Everything Data plans and our Any Mobile AnytimeSM feature that offer savings compared to our competition. In addition to savings offered to consumers, Business Advantage pricing plans are available to our business subscribers who can also take advantage of Any Mobile AnytimeSM with certain plans. To simplify and improve the custom er experience, we introduced the Sprint Free Guarantee, which gives any customer opening a new line of service the chance to try Sprint for 30 days for free (excluding overages and premium services not included in price plans). In addition, we have continued to offer Ready Now, which trains our customers before they leave the store on how to use their mobile devices. For our business customers, we aim to increase their productivity by providing differentiated services that utilize the advantages of combining IP networks with wireless technology. This differentiation enables us to acquire and retain both wireline, wireless and combined wireline wireless subscribers on our networks. We have also continued to focus on further improving customer care. We implemented initiatives that are designed to improve call center processes and procedures, and standardized our performance measures through various metrics, including customer satisfaction ratings with respect to customer care, first call resolution and calls p er subscriber. Our product strategy is to provide our customers with a broad array of device selections and applications and services that run on these devices to meet the growing needs of customer mobility. Our multi functional device portfolio includes devices such as the Samsung Epic 4G Android&trade; device, which can also act as a mobile hotspot for up to five wireless fidelity (WiFi) enabled devices and the worlds first 3G/4G Android&trade; device, the HTC EVO&trade; 4G, which can also act as a mobile hotspot for up to eight WiFi enabled devices. Our portfolio also includes the Motorola i1 which is the worlds first Direct Connect&reg; Android powered smartphone. Other devices in our portfolio are the HTC Hero&trade; and the Samsung Moment&trade; with Google&trade;, the BlackBerry 8530 and BlackBerry&reg; Bold&trade;, the Samsung Seek&trade;, the Rumor Touch from LG and the Touch Pro 2 from HTC. Our mobile broadband device portfolio consists of devices such as the Overdrive&trade; 3G/4G Mobile Hotspot, which allows the connection of up to five WiFi enabled devices, the Spr int 4G USB U1901 and the Ovation&trade; U760 by Novatel Wireless. We support the open development of applications and content on our network platforms. We also enable a variety of third party providers, location based services and business and consumer product providers through our machine to machine initiative. The machine to machine initiative incorporates selling, marketing, product development and operations resources to address growing non traditional data needs, which covers a wide variety of products and services including remote monitoring, telematics, in vehicle devices, e readers, specialized medical devices and other original equipment manufacturer devices. Our prepaid portfo lio launched additional brands in the second quarter 2010. Sprints prepaid portfolio currently includes four brands, each designed to appeal to specific customer segments. Boost Mobile serves customers who are voice and text messaging centric with its popular $50 Monthly Unlimited plan with Shrinkage service where bills are reduced after six on time payments. Virgin Mobile serves customers who are device and data oriented with Beyond Talk&trade; plans and our broadband plan, Broadband2Go, that offer consumers control, flexibility and connectivity through various communication vehicles. Assurance Wireless provides eligible customers, who meet income requirements or are receiving government assistance, with a free wireless phone and 250 free minutes of national local and long distance monthly service. Common CentsSM Mobile caters to budget conscious customers with 7 cent minutes that Round Down&trade; and 7 cent text messages. Sprint has focused its wholesale business as a reseller of new converged services that leverage the Sprint network but are sold under the wholesalers brand by providing a suite of integrated and customizeable value added solutions focused on assisting our customers to improve their business. We have adopted new pricing models, made it easier for our wholesalers to acquire access and resell our services by bundling wireless and wireline services and focused our attention to partners with existing distribution channels. In addition, we have strengthened our sales efforts and expanded to new markets in the rapidly 24Table of Contentsgrowing machine to machine space. In addition to our brand and customer oriented goals, w e have also taken steps, beginning in 2008, to generate increased operating cash flow through competitive new rate plans for postpaid and prepaid subscribers, multi branded strategies and reductions to our cost structure to align with the reduced revenues from fewer postpaid subscribers. Our cost reductions are primarily attributable to reductions in capital spending, workforce reductions, call center closures as a result of fewer calls per subscriber and limiting marketing spend to focused initiatives. We believe these actions, as well as our continued efforts to reduce other operating expenses, will allow us to continue to maintain an adequate cash position. Network VisionIn December 2010, Sprint announced Network Vision, a multi year network infrastructure initiative intended to provide customers with an enhanced network experience by improving voice quality and providing faster data speeds, while creating network flexibility, reducing operating costs, and improving environmental sustainability by enabling the aggregation of multiple spectrum bands onto a single multi mode base station. In addition to implementing these multi mode base stations, this plan encompasses next generation push to talk technology with broadband capabilities and the integration of multi mode chipsets into smartphones, tablets and other broadband devices, including machine to machine capabilities. Consolidating and optimizing the use of Sprints 800 MHz, 1.9GHz and potentially other spectrum (such as the 2.5GHz owned by Clearwire) into multi mode stations should allow Sprint to repurpose spectrum to enhance coverage, particularly around the in building experience. The multi mode technolog y also utilizes software based solutions with interchangeable hardware to provide greater network flexibility, which allows for opportunities to evaluate new 4G technologies to better utilize Sprints available spectrum.The first stages of equipment testing are expected to begin in early 2011 and, if successful, broad scale deployment is expected in the latter half of 2011 with an expected completion time of anywhere from three to five years. As Network Vision is implemented, the size and power required to operate cell sites used by Sprint is expected to be reduced. Sprint expects the plan to bring financial benefit to the company through convergence to one common network, which is expected to reduce network maintenance and operating costs through capital efficiencies, reduced energy costs, lower roaming expenses, backhaul savings and the eventual reduc tion in total cell sites and also by reducing the cost of handling expanded data traffic. Sprint has entered into agreements relating to Network Vision to deploy a cost effective, innovative network to enhance the voice quality and data speeds by consolidating multiple technologies into one network. The successful testing and deployment related to these changes in technology will result in incremental charges during the period of implementation including, but not limited to, an increase in depreciation and amortization associated with existing iDEN assets due to changes in our estimates of the remaining useful lives of long lived assets, and the expected timing of asset retirement obligations, which could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The successful testing of push to talk technology on the CDMA network in our test mar kets in 2011 would result in increased depreciation and amortization expense expected to range from $1.0 billion to $1.5 billion if implementation can be completed by the end of 2014. Successful completion of Network Vision earlier or later than the end of 2014 would result in an acceleration or delay, respectively, of these depreciation and amortization costs.Effects on our Wireless Business of Postpaid Subscriber Losses The following table shows annual net additions (losses) of postpaid subscribers for the past five years, excluding subscribers obtained through business combinations. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 2007 2006 ( in thousan ds)Total net additions (losses) of postpaid subscribers(855) (3,546) (4,073) (1,224) 279 As shown by the table below under Results of Operations, Wireless segment earnings represents approximately 80% of Sprints total consolidated segment earnings. The wireless industry is subject to intense compet ition to acquire and retain subscribers of wireless services. Most markets in which we operate have high rates of penetration for wireless services. Wireless carriers accordingly must attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from competitors rather than from first time subscribers. Within the Wireless segment, postpaid wireless voice and data services represent the most significant contributors to earnings, and are driven by the number of postpaid subscribers to our services, as well as the average revenue per subscriber or user (ARPU). 25Table of ContentsBeginning in 2008, in conjunction with changes in senior management, Sprint undertook steps to address and reduce postpaid subscriber losses. Perceptions in the marketplace, in part as a result of the subscriber losses themselves, as well as other factors, reduced the Sprint brands effectiveness in attracting and retaining customers. Steps were taken to improve the Sprint networks, as well as to improve the quality of Sprints customer care experience, as confirmed by independent comparisons with competitors. Steps were also taken to improve the credit quality mix of our subscriber base and to improve our financial stability, including cost control actions, which have resulted in our continuing strong cash flow from operations. In addition, beginning in 2008 and continuing through 2010, we have undertaken initiatives to strengthen the Sprint brand. We conti nue to increase market awareness of the improvements that have been achieved in the customer experience, including the speed and dependability of our networks. We have also introduced new devices improving our overall lineup and providing a competitive portfolio for customer selection, as well as competitive new rate plans providing simplicity and value. We believe these actions had a favorable impact on net postpaid subscriber losses in 2009 and 2010, and we expect these to further improve our subscriber results. Beginning in the second quarter 2009 and continuing through 2010, the Company has begun to see a reduction in our net loss of postpaid subscribers. For the year ended December 31, 2010, net postpaid subscriber losses of 855,000 improved by 2.7 million, or 76% compared to losses of 3.5 million in 2009. The net loss of postpaid subscribers in 2009 and 2010 can be expected to cause wireless service revenue in 2011 to be approximately $2.4 billion lower than it would have bee n had those subscribers not been lost. Notwithstanding our historical postpaid subscriber losses, consolidated service revenue has begun to stabilize primarily as a result of increased service revenue associated with our prepaid wireless offerings, including the acquisition of Virgin Mobile in the fourth quarter of 2009. As a result, Sprints prepaid wireless offerings, as well as cost controls that have been implemented, will continue to partially offset the effects of net postpaid subscriber losses, but are unlikely to be sufficient to sustain the Companys level of results from operations and cash flows unless we are successful in further improving our postpaid subscriber results. If our trend of improved postpaid subscriber results does not continue, it could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations and liquidity in 2011 and beyond. The Company believes the actions that have been taken, as described above, and that continue to be taken in marketing, customer servi ce, device offerings, and network quality, should continue to reduce the number of net postpaid subscriber losses experienced during 2011.

Consolidated segment earnings decreased $774 million, or 12%, in 2010 compared to 2009 and $1.26 billion, or 16%, in 2009 compared to 2008. Consolidated segment earnings consist of our Wireless and Wireline segments, which are discussed below, and Corporate, other and eliminations. Corporate, other and eliminations improved $275 million for 2009 compared to 2008 primarily as a result of costs incurred related to the build up of our next generation wireless broadband network in 2008 that are no longer being incurred in 2009 due to the close of the transaction with Clearwire in late 2008. 26Table of ContentsDepreciation and Amortization Expense Depreciation expense decreased $753 million, or 13%, in 2010 compared to 2009 and $137 million, or 2%, in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to a reduction in the replacement rate of capital additions resulting from reduced capital spending associated with our cost control actions beginning in 2008. The average annual capital expenditures for the three years ended 2007 were approximately $6.3 billion as compared to average annual capital expenditures of $2.5 billion for the three years ended 2010. Amortization expense declined $415 million, or 26%, in 2010 compared to 2009 and $854 million, or 35%, in 2009 as compared to 2008, primarily due to reductions in amortization of customer relationship intangible assets as a result of those related to the 2005 acquisition of Nextel becoming fully amortized. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in amortization related to customer relationship intangible assets acquired in connection with the iPCS, Inc. (iPCS) and Virgin Mobile acquisitions in the fourth quarter 2009. Customer relationships are amortized using the sum of the years digits method, resulting in higher amortization r ates in early periods that decline over time. Goodwill Impairment and Merger and Integration ExpensesThe Company recognized a non cash goodwill impairment of $963 million during 2008. The impaired goodwill was primarily attributable to the Companys acquisition of Nextel in 2005 and reflects the reduction in the estimated fair value of Sprints wireless reporting unit subsequent to the acquisition resulting from, among other factors, net losses of postpaid subscribers. Merger and integration expenses decreased $130 million, or 100%, in 2009 compared to 2008 as integration activities were completed during 2008. Other, net The following table provides additional information of items included in Other, net for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008. Year E nded December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions)Severance and exit costs$(8) $(400) $(355)Asset impairments(125) (47) (480)Gain s from asset dispositions and exchanges69 68 29 Other84 (10) &mdash; Total$20 $(389) $(806)Other, net improved $409 million, or 105%, in 2010 compared to 2009 and $417 million, or 52%, in 2009 compared to 2008. During 2010 we recognized $8 million of severance and exit costs primarily related to exit costs incurred in the second and fourth quarter 2010 associated with vacating certain office space which is no longer being utilized. We recognized $400 million and $355 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively, of severance and exit costs related to the separation of employees and organizational realignment initiatives. Asset impairments increased by $78 million, or 166%, in 2010 compared to 2009 and decreased $433 million, or 90%, in 2009 compared to 2008. Asset impairments primarily relate to assets that are no longer necessary for managements strategic plans. In 2010 and 2009 these costs were primarily related to network asset equipment. Asset impairments in 2008 also include previously recognized cell site development costs. Gains from asset dispositions and exchanges for 2010, 2009, and 2008 are primarily related to spectrum exchange transactions. Other increased $94 million primarily due to an increase in benefits resulting from favorable developments relating to access cost disputes with certain exchange carriers in 2010 as compared to 2009. Interest Expense Interest expense increased $14 million, or 1%, in 2010 as compared to 2009. This increase was primarily due to higher effective interest rates on our average long term debt balances and increased costs on our revolving credit facilities, which include the accelerated amortization of previously unamortized debt issuance costs from the retirement of our form er credit facility in May 2010 partially offset by reductions in interest expense previously recorded as a result of favorable tax outcomes. Interest expense increased $88 million, or 7%, in 2009 as compared to 2008, as fewer capital projects led to a decrease of $111 million o f capitalized interest partially offset by a decrease of $56 million related to a $1.5 billion decline in the weighted average long term debt balance between the comparative periods. The effective interest rate on the weighted average long term debt balance of $20.6 billion, $21.4 billion and $22.9 billion was 7.2%, 6.8% and 6.6% for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information on the Companys financing activities. 27Table of ContentsEquity in Losses of Unconsolidated Investments, net This item consists mainly of our proportionate share of losses from our equity method investments. Equity losses associated with the investment in Clearwire consists of Sprints share of Clearwires net loss and other adjustments such as gains or losses associated with the dilution of Sprints ownership interest resulting from Clearwires equity issuances. Equity in losses from Clearwire were $1.3 billion, $803 million, and $142 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The 2009 equity in losses of Clearwire include a pre tax dilution loss of $154 million ($96 million after tax) recognized in the first quarter 2009, representing the finaliz ation of ownership percentages associated with the formation of Clearwire, which was subject to change based on the trading price of Clearwire stock during the 90 days subsequent to the November 2008 closing. Clearwire owns and operates a next generation mobile broadband network that provides high speed residential and mobile internet access services and residential voice services in communities throughout the country. Clearwire is an early stage company, and as such, has heavily invested in building its network and acquiring other assets necessary to expand the business during 2009 and 2010, which has resulted in increased operating losses and reduced liquidity. We expect Clearwire to continue to generate significant net losses in the near term as it executes its business plan.Other income, net The following table provides additional information of items included in Other income, net for each of the three years ended December 31, 2010. Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions)Interest income$35 $34 $97 Realized loss from investments(3) (29) (24)Gain on previously held non controlling interest in Virgin Mobile&mdash; 151 &mdash; Other14 1 16 Total$46 $157 $89 Interest income remained relatively stable in 2010, as compared to 2009. Interest income decreased $63 million, or 65%, in 2009 as co mpared to 2008, primarily due to lower interest rates. Realized loss from investments decreased $26 million, or 90%, in 2010, as compared to 2009 primarily due to fewer sales of marketable securities. As a result of the acquisition of Virgin Mobile, a non cash gain of $151 million ($92 million after tax) was recognized in the fourth quarter 2009 related to the estimated fair value over net carrying value of our previously held non controlling interest in Virgin Mobile. Income Tax (Expense) Benefit The consolidat ed effective tax rate was an expense of approximately 5% in 2010 and a benefit of approximately 30% and 31% in 2009 and 2008, res pectively. The income tax expense for 2010 and the benefit for 2009 include a $1.4 billion and $281 million net increase to the valuation allowance for federal and state deferred tax assets related to net operating loss carryforwards generated during the periods. We do not expect to record significant tax benefits on future net operating losses until our circumstances justify the recognition of such benefits. The 2008 income tax benefit includes $278 million related to non cash goodwill impairment as substantially all of the charges are not separately deductible for tax purposes. Additional information related to items impacting the effective tax rates can be found in note 10 of Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Segment Earnings Wireless Wireless segment earnings are primarily a function of wireless service revenue, costs to acquire subscribers, network and interconnection costs to serve those subscribers and other Wireless segment operating expenses. The costs to acquire our subscribers include the net cost at which we sell our devices, referred to as subsidies, as well as the marketing and sales costs incurred to attract those subscribers. Network costs primarily represent switch and cell site costs and interconnection costs, which generally consist of per minute usage fees and roaming fees paid to other carriers. The remaining costs associated with operating the Wireless segment include the costs to operate our customer care organization and administrative support. Wireless service revenue, costs to acquire subscribers, and variable network and interconnection costs fluctuate with the changes in our subscriber base and their related usage, but some cost elements do not fluctuate in the short term with these changes. The following table provides an overview of the results of operations of our Wireless segment for each of the three years ended December 31, 2010. 28Table of Contents Year Ended December 31,Wireless Earnings2010 2009 2008 (in millions)Postpaid$21,921 $23,205 $25,994 Prepaid3,756 2,081 1,498 Retail service revenue25,677 25,286 27,492 Wholesale, affiliate and other revenue217 546 943 Total service revenue25,894 25,832 28,435 Cost of services (exclusive of depreciation and amortization)(8,288) (8,384) (8,745)Service gross margin17,606 17,448 19,690 Service gross margin percentage68 % 68 % 69 %Equipment revenue2,703 1,954 1,992 Cost of products(6,965) (5,545) (4,859)Equipment net subsidy(4,262) (3,591) (2,867)Equipment net subsidy percentage(158)% (184)% (144)%Selling, general and administrative expense(8,813) (8,659) (10,047)Wireless segment earnings$4,531 $5,198 $6,776 Service Revenue Our Wireless segment generates revenues from the sale of wireless services, the sale of wireless devices and accessories and the sale of wholesale and other services. Service revenue consists of fixed monthly recurring charges, variable usage charges and miscellaneous fees such as activation fees, director y assistance, roaming, equipment protection, late payment and early termination charges and certain regulatory related fees, net of service credits. The ability of our Wireless segment to generate service revenues is primarily a function of: &bull; revenue generated from each subscriber, which in turn is a function of the types and amount of services utilized by each subscriber and the rates charged for those services; and&bull; the number of subscribers that we serve, which in turn is a function of our ability to acquire new and retain existing subscribers.Retail comprises those subscribers to whom Sprint directly provides wireless services on our networks or networks we utilize through MVNO relationships, such as our relationship with Clearwire, whether those services are provided on a postpaid or a prepaid basis. Retail service revenue increased $391 million, or 2%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 and decreased $2.2 billion, or 8% in 2009 as compared to 2008. The increase in retail service revenue was primarily driven by attracting subscribers to the Companys National Boost Monthly Unlimited prepaid plan in addition to service revenue related to the subscribers acquired through our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions of Virgin Mobile and iPCS. This increase in retail service revenue was partially offset by a decrease in postpaid service revenue driven by a reduction in the Companys average number of postpaid subscribers of approximately 1.4 million, or 4%, in 201 0 as compared to 2009. The majority of the decline in 2009 as compared to 2008 is primarily due to a decrease in postpaid service revenue driven by a reduction in the Companys average number of postpaid subscribers of approximately 4.1 million, or 11%, for the year ended December 31, 2009 partially offset by an increase in prepaid revenue primarily driven by attracting subscribers to the Companys National Boost Monthly Unlimited prepaid plan. Wholesale and affiliates are those subscribers who are served through MVNO and affiliate relationships, such as our relationship with Clearwire, and other arrangements through which wireless services are sold by Sprint to other companies that resell those services to subscribers. Wholesale, affiliate and other revenues, in total, decreased $329 million, or 60%, for 2010 as compared to 2009, and $397 million, or 42%, for 2009 as compared to 2008. The majority of the decrease in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to the transfer of 5.4 million subscribers from wholesale and affiliates into postpaid and prepaid classifications as a result of the fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions of Virg in Mobile and iPCS. The remaining decline in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to losses from two of our large MVNOs throughout 2009 in addition to lower revenues received from services provided through our machine to machine initiative. The decrease in 2009 as compared to 2008 was primarily due to losses from two of our large MVNOs during 2009. Approximately 41% of our wholesale and affiliate subscribers represent a growing number of devices that utilize our network under our machine to machine initiative. These devices generate revenue from non contract usage which varies depending on the machine to machine service being utilized. Average revenue per subscriber for our open device machine to machine services is generally significantly lower than revenue from other wholesale and affiliate subscribers; however, the cost to service these customers is also lower resulting in a higher profit margin as a percent of revenue.29Table of ContentsAverage Monthly Service Revenue per Subscriber and Subscriber Trends The table below summarizes average number of retail subscribers and average revenue per subscriber for the years ended December 31, 201 0, 2009 and 2008. Additional information about the number of subscribers, net additions to subscribers, average monthly service revenue per subscriber and average rates of monthly postpaid and prepaid customer churn for each quarter since the first quarter 2008 may be found in the table on the following page.

Average subscribers for the years ended December 31, 2010 and 2009 are inclusive of prepaid and postpaid subscribers acquired through our 2009 business combinations of Virgin Mobile and iPCS, which were previously included within wholesale and affiliate subscribers. In addition, average prepaid subscribers for the same periods are exclusive of 49,000 subscribers transferred to wholesale and affiliates as a result of a sale and transfer of customers to an affiliate in 2010. (2) Average monthly service revenue per subscriber is calculated by dividing service revenue by the sum of the average number of subscribers. Changes in average monthly service revenue reflect subscribers who change rate plans, the level of voice and data usage, the amount of service credits which are offered to subscribers, plus the net effect of average monthly revenue generated by new subscribers and deactivating subscribers. Average monthly postpaid service revenue per subscriber for 2010 declined slightly as compared to 2009 due to declines in overage revenues resulting from the increased popularity of fixed rate bundled plans including the Any Mobile AnytimeSM feature. Average monthly retail postpaid service revenue per subscriber was stable for 2009 compared to 2008 as a result of improved retention of higher revenue subscribers on bundled rate plans offset by lower overage and roaming revenues. Average monthly prepaid service revenue per subscriber for 2010 decreased compared to 2009 due to prepaid subscribers acquired in our fourth quarter 2009 business combination of Virgin Mobile as well as net subscriber additions under our Assurance Wireless brand launched in early 2010, which carry a lower average revenue per subscriber compared to Sprints other prepaid subscribers. Average monthly prepaid service revenue per subscriber increased during 2009 as compared to 2008 due to higher revenue from our National Boost Monthly Unlimited users combined with more stable average revenue per subscriber from our traditional prepaid users. The lower prepaid average revenue per subscriber and the increased weighting of average prepaid subscribers to total subscribers resulted in a decline in our average retail service revenue per subscriber for 2010 compared to 2009.&nb sp;30Table of ContentsThe following table shows (a) net additions (losses) of wireless subscribers for the past twelve quarters, excluding subscribers obtained through business combinations, (b) our total subscribers as of the end of each quarterly period, (c) our average monthly post paid and prepaid service revenue per subscriber, and (d) our average rates of monthly postpaid and prepaid customer churn for the past twelve quarters.

This change in presentation of previously reported amounts had no effect on total retail postpaid net additions or other subscriber related performance metrics in any prior periods and better reflects Sprints trend of subscriber activity by network technology. (2) Includes subscribers with PowerSource devices, which operate seamlessly between our CDMA and iDEN networks. (3) In the first quarter 2009, Boost Monthly Unlimited was launched on iDEN. In the first quarter 2010, Boost Monthly Unlimited was launched on CDMA.(4) Reflects the transfer of 4,539,000 Prepaid and 835,000 Postpaid subscribers from Wholesale and affiliates as a result of the business combinations completed in the fourth quarter 2009 as well as the third quarter 2010 transfer of 49,000 Wholesale and affiliates subscribers from Prepaid as a result of a sale and transfer of customers to an affiliate. (5) Churn is calculated by dividing net subscriber deactivations for the quarter by the sum of the average number of subscribers for each month in the quarter. For postpaid accounts comprising multiple subscribers, such as family plans and enterprise accounts, net deactivations are defined as deactivations in excess of customer activations in a particular account within 30 days. Postpaid and Prepaid churn consist of both voluntary churn, where the subscriber makes his or her own determination to cease being a customer, and involuntary churn, where the customers service is terminated due to a lack of payment or other reasons. 31Table of ContentsRetail Postpaid Subscribers&mdash;We lost 855,000 net postpaid subscribers during 2010 as compared to losing 3.5 million and 4.1 million net postpaid subscribers during 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our improvement in net postpaid subscriber losses year over year can be attributed to our impro vements in retail postpaid gross adds and lower postpaid churn resulting from simplified and value driven bundled offers, a more competitive device line up, as well as our continued improvements in overall customer experience and customer care satisfaction. Retail Prepaid Subscribers&mdash;We added approximately 1.6 million net prepaid subscribers during 2010 as compared to adding 2.6 million and losing 981,000 net prepaid subscribers in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Our net prepaid subscriber additions in 2010 were principally driven by net additions from the Assurance Wireless and Boost Mobile brands, partially offset by net losses associated with the Virgin Mobile brand including a transfer of 49,000 subscribers from prepaid to wholesale and affiliates as a result of a sale and transfer of customers to an affiliate. Our net prepaid subscriber additions in 2009 as compared to losses in 2008 were principa lly driven by the Boost Monthly Unlimited plan. Prepaid subscribers are generally deactivated between 60 days and up to 150 days from the date of activation or replenishment; however, prior to account deactivation, targeted retention programs can be offered to qualifying subscribers to maintain ongoing service by providing up to an additional 150 days to make a replenishment. Subscribers targeted through these retention offers are not included in the calculation of churn until their retention offer expires without a replenishment to their account. As a result, end of period prepaid subscribers include subscribers engaged in these retention programs. Retention offers to these targeted subscribers remained consistent as a percentage of our total prepaid subscriber base during 2010. Wholesale and Affiliate Subscribers&mdash;Wholesale and affiliate subscribers represent customers that are served on our networks through companies that resell our services to their subscribers, customers residing in affiliate territories and a growing portion of subscribers from our machine to machine initiative primarily representing devices that utilize our network. During 2010, wholesale and affiliate subscriber additions were 994,000 resulting in approximately 4.5 million wholesale and affiliate subscribers a s of December 31, 2010, compared to approximately 3.5 million and 9.0 million wholesale and affiliate subscribers as of December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. The increase in the wholesale subscriber base was primarily due to subscriber additions in other MVNO relations hips during 2010. The decrease from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to subscribers transferred to postpaid and prepaid as result of the fourth quarter 2009 business combinations of Virgin Mobile and iPCS. Of the remaining 4.5 million subscribers included in wholesale and affiliate, approximately 41% represent machine to machine activities such as e readers, in vehicle devices and telematics. Subscribers through some of our MVNO relationships have inactivity either in voice usage or primarily as a result of the nature of the device, where activity only occurs when data retrieval is initiated by the end user and may occur infrequently. Although we continue to provide these customers access to our network through our MVNO relationships, approximately 959,000 subscribers through these MVNO relationships have been inactive for at least six months, with no associated r evenue. Cost of Services Cost of services consists primarily of:&bull; costs to operate and maintain our CDMA and iDEN networks, including direct switch and cell site costs, such as rent, utilities, maintenance, labor costs associated with network employees and spectrum frequency leasing costs; &bull; fixed and variable interconnection costs, the fixed component of which consists of monthly flat rate fees for facilities leased from local exchange carriers based on the number of cell sites and switches in service in a particular period and the related equipment installed at each site, and the variable component of which generally consists of per minute use fees charged by wireline provider s for calls terminating on their networks, which fluctuate in relation to the level and duration of those terminating calls;&bull; long distance costs paid to the Wireline segment;&bull; &nb sp;costs to service and repair devices;&bull; regulatory fees;&bull; &n bsp;roaming fees paid to other carriers; and &bull; fixed and variable costs relating to payments to third parties for the use of their proprietary data applications, such as messaging, music, TV and navigation services by our subscribers.Cost of services decreased $96 million, or 1%, in 2010 compared to 2009, primarily reflecting a decline in service and repair costs by focusing on device repairs and refurbishment rather than utilizing new devices, a decline in long distance network costs as a result of lower market rates as well as a decline in payments to third party vendors providing premium services as a result of changing from usage based payments to flat r ates. This decline was partially offset by increased roaming due to higher data usage and an increase in license fees as a result of the continued growth in smartphone devices, which carry higher fees. Cost of services decreased $361 million, or 4%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 primarily reflecting a decline in labor, outside services and maintenance costs consistent with the Companys cost cutting efforts, as well as a decl ine in network costs associated with fewer subscribers.32Table of ContentsEquipment Net Subsidy We recognize equipment revenue and corresponding costs of devices when title of the device passes to the dealer or end user cu stomer. Our marketing plans assume that devices typically will be sold at prices below cost, which is consistent with industry practice, as subscriber retention efforts often include providing incentives to subscribers such as offering new devices at discounted prices. We reduce equipment revenue for these discounts offered directly to the customer, or for certain payments to third party dealers to reimburse the dealer for point of sale discounts that are offered to the end user subscriber. Additionally, the cost of devices is reduced by any rebates that are earned from the supplier. Cost of devices and accessories also includes order fulfillment related expenses and write downs of device and related accessory inventory for shrinkage and obsolescence. Equipment cost in excess of the revenue generated from equipment sales is referred to in the industry as equipment net subsidy. Equipment revenue increased $749 million, or 38%, in 2010 compared to 2009 and cost of devices increased $1.4 billion, or 26%, in 2010 compared to 2009. The increase in both equipment revenue and cost of devices is primarily due to an increase in the number of postpaid devices sold with a greater mix of devices that have a higher average sales price and cost, as well as an increase in the number of prepaid devices sold. Equipment revenue decreased $38 million, or 2%, in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to declining average sales prices for devices with higher functionality as a result of competitive and economic pressures, partially offset by an increase in the number of lower priced prepaid devices sold in 2009 as compared to 2008. Cost of devices increased $699 million, or 15%, in 2009 compared to 2008, primarily due to our mix of devices sold reflecting a greater mix of postpaid devices sold with a higher functionality and an increase in the number of devices sold.Selling, General and Administrative Expense Sales and marketing costs primarily consist of customer acquisition costs, including commissions paid to our indirect dealers, third party distributors and retail sales force for new device activations and upgrades, residual payments to our indirect dealers, payroll and facilities costs associated with our retail sales force, marketing employees, advertising, media programs and sponsorships, including costs related to branding. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for billing, customer care and information technology operations, bad debt expense and administrative support activities, including collections, legal, finance, human resources, strategic planning and technology and product development. Sales and marketing expense increased $322 million, or 7%, in 2010 from 2009 as compared to a decrease of $273 million, or 6%, in 2009 from 2008. The increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 is primarily due to the additional costs associated with our increase in subscriber gross additions combined with incremental costs associated with our business combinations in the fourth quarter 2009, offset by a decline in marketing expenditures related to our cost cutting initiatives. The decline in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily due to a decline in gross subscriber additions compared to 2008 and a decline in labor related c osts due to our workforce and cost reduction activities. General and administrative costs decreased $203 million, or 5%, in 2010 from 2009 and $1.1 billion, or 22%, in 2009 from 2008. The decline in general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2010 reflects a reduction in customer care costs and minor continued effects of workforce reductions and cost cutting initiatives announced in 2009 offset by increases as a result of the fourth quarter 2009 business combinations of Virgin Mobile and iPCS in addition to an increase in bad debt expense. The decline in general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2009 is primarily due to reductions in customer care costs, the decrease in employee related costs as part of our cost cutting initiatives and lower bad debt expense. Customer care costs decreased $87 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 and $363 million in 2009 as compared to 2008. The improvement in customer care costs is largely attributable to customer care quality initiatives launched in 2008 that have resulted in a reduction in calls per subscriber by 39% f rom 2007 peak levels which allowed for a reduction of 19 call centers in 2009 and 11 call centers in 2008. Employee related costs in 2010 were consistent with 2009 and costs decreased approximately $536 million in 2009 as compared to 2008, due to workforce reductions announced in January and November 2009. Bad debt expense was $423 million for the year ended December 31, 2010 representing a $31 million increase, as compared to bad debt expense of $392 million in 2009. The increase in bad debt expense primarily reflects 2009 reductions in allowances for bad debt due to increased rates of recovery. For the year ended December 31, 2009, bad debt expense decreased $240 million as compared to bad debt expense of $632 million in 2008. The improvement in bad debt expense resulted from lower rates of uncollectibility during the period, as well a s lower estimated uncollectible accounts in outstanding accounts receivable. We reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly. Changes in our allowance for doubtful accounts are largely attributable to credit policies established for subscribers and analysis of historical collection experience. Our mix of prime postpaid subscribers to total postpaid subscribers remained flat at 84% as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. 33Table of ContentsSegment Earnings Wireline Wireline segment earnings are primarily a function of wireline service revenue, network and interconnection costs and other Wireline segment operating expenses. Network costs primarily represent special access costs and interconnection costs which generally consist of domestic and international per minute usage fees paid to other carriers. The remaining costs associated with operating the Wireline segment include the costs to operate our customer care and billing organizations in addition to administrative support. Wireline service revenue, and variable network and interconnection costs fluctuate with the changes in our customer base and their related usage, but some cost elements do not fluctuate in the short term with the changes in our customer usage. Our wireline services provided to our Wireless segment are generally accounted for based on market rates which we believe approximate fair value. The Company generally re establishes these rates at the beginning of each fiscal year. Over the past several years, there has been an industry wide trend of lower rates due to increased competition from other wireline and wireless communications companies as well as cable and internet service providers. For 2011, we expect wireline service gross margin to decline by approximately $200 to $250 million to reflect changes in market prices for services provided by our Wireline segment to our Wireless segment. This decline in wireline service gross margin related to intercompany pricing will not affect Sprints consolidated results of operations as our Wireless segme nt will benefit from an equivalent reduction in cost of service. The following table provides an overview of the results of operations of our Wireline segment for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009 and 2008.  Year Ended December 31,Wireline Earnings2010 2009 2008 (in millions)Voice$2,249 $2,563 $3,079 Data519 662 959 Internet2,175 2,293 2,148 Other97 111 146 Total net service revenue5,040 5,629 6,332 Cost of services and products(3,319) (3,663) (4,192)Service gross margin1,721 1,966 2,140 Service gross margin percentage34% 35% 34%Selling, general and administrative expense(631) (745) (965)Wireline segment earnings$1,090 $1,221 $1,175 Wireline Revenue Voice Revenues Voice revenues decreased $314 million, or 12%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 and decreased $516 million, or 17%, in 2009 as compared to 2008. The 2010 and 2009 decreases were primarily driven by volume declines due to customer churn as well as overall price declines. Voice revenues generated from the sale of services to our Wireless segment represented 33% of total voice revenues in 2010 as compared to 31% in 2009 and 26% in 2008. Data Revenues Data revenues reflect sales of data services, including ATM, frame relay and managed network services. Data revenues decreased $143 million, or 22%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 and decreased $297 million, or 31%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 due to declines in frame relay and asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) services as subscribers migrated to IP based technologies. Data revenues generated from the provision of services to the Wireless segment represented 27% of total data revenue in 2010 as compared to 19% in 2009 and 13% in 2008. Internet Revenues Internet revenues reflect sales of IP based data services, including MPLS, VoIP and SIP. Internet revenues decreased $118 million, or 5%, in 2010 from 2009 as compared to an increase of $145 million, or 7%, in 2009 from 2008. The 2010 decrease was due to a decline in new IP customers with lower market rates as a result of increased competition. The 2009 increase was due to higher IP revenues as business subscribers were increasing requirements to support wireless customers data traffic, in addition to revenue growth in cable VoIP, which experienced a 15% increase in subscribers in 2009 as compared to 2008. Internet revenues generated from the provision of services to the Wireless segment represented 10% of total Internet revenues in 2010 as compared to 11% in 2009 and 9% in 2008. Some MSOs are in the process of in sourcing their digital voice products for which the transition and associated revenue reductions will occur over the next several years with a decrease of approximately $200 million to occur in 2011. 34Table of ContentsOther Revenues Other revenues, which primarily consist of sales of customer premises equipment (CPE), decreased $14 million, or 13% in 2010 as compared to 2009 and $35 million, or 24%, in 2009 as compared to 2008 as a result of fewer projects in 2010 and 2009. Costs of Services and Products Costs of services and products include access costs paid to local phone companies, other domestic service providers and foreign phone companies to complete calls made by our domestic subscribers, costs to operate and maintain our networks and costs of equipment. Costs of services and products decreased $344 million, or 9%, in 2010 from 2009 and $529 million, or 13%, in 2009 from 2008. The decrease in 2010 and 2009 is primarily due to declining voice volumes and a shift in mix to lower cost products as a result of the migration from data to IP based technologies. Service gross margin percentage increased from 34% in 2008 to 35% in 2009 and decreased back to 34% in 2010. The increase from 2008 to 2009 was primarily due to revenue growth in our cable VoIP business and a decrease in costs of services and products offset by a decrease in voice revenue. The decrease from 2009 to 2010 was as a result of a decrease in net service revenue offset by a decrease in costs of services and products.Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $114 million, or 15%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 and $220 million, or 23% in 2009 as compared 2008. The decreases were primarily due to a reduction in employee headcount and a decline in the use of outside services and maintenance as part of our cost cutting initiatives. Total selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net services revenue was 13% in 2010 and 2009 and 15% in 2008. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow  Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 (in millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$4,815 $4,891 $6,179 Net cash used in investing activities(2,556) (3,844) (4,250)Net cash used in financing activities(905) (919) (484)Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $4.8 billion in 2010 decreased $76 million from the same period in 2009 primarily due to a $196 million decrease in cash received from our subscribers resulting from a decline in our postpaid subscriber customer base, an increase of $217 million in cash paid to our suppliers and employees, and an increase of $36 million in cash paid for interest. These were partially offset by an increase of $170 million in cash received for income tax refunds. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2009 also includes a cash payment of $200 million resulting from a contr ibution to the Company pension plan. Net cash provided by operating activities of $4.9 billion in 2009 decreased by $1.3 billion from 2008, primarily due to a $3.6 billion decrease in cash received from our subscribers as a result of declining service revenues from our loss of post paid subscribers and a $200 million contribution to the Company pension plan during 2009. These declines were offset by a decrease of $2.1 billion in cash paid to our suppliers and employees primarily due to reductions in variable cost of services and products and selling, general and administrative expenses due to the various cost cutting initiatives implemented over the past year. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2008 is net of cash used for operating activities of approximately $300 million that related to our operations that were contributed to Clearwire in November 2008.Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for 2010 decreased by $1.3 billion from 2009, due to a decrease of $300 million in purchases of short term investments and a decrease of $132 million in expenditures related to FCC licenses as determined by specific operations requirements of the Report and Order. These decreases were partially offset by reduced proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments of $418 million and increased capital exp enditures of $332 million to add coverage and capacity to our wireless networks. Sprint also increased its investment in Clearwire by $1.1 billion and acquired iPCS and Virgin Mobile for $560 million in 2009, which resulted in the remaining decline in 2010 as compared to 2009. Net cash used in investing activities for 2009 decreased by $406 million from 2008, primarily due to an increase of $369 million in proceeds from short term investments and a decrease in capital expenditures of $2.3 billion in 2009 as 35Table of Contentscompared to 2008 mainly due to fewer cell sites built in 2009, fewer IT and network development projects and costs incurred related to the build up of WiMAX in 2008 that are no longer being incurred in 2009 due to the close of the transaction with Clearwire in November 2008. The decreases were offset by increased purc hases of $599 million in short term investments, a $1.1 billion increase of Sprints investment in Clearwire and $560 million used to acquire Virgin Mobile and iPCS in the fourth quarter 2009. Net cash used in investing activities for 2008 include expenditures of approximately $600 million related to capital assets and FCC licenses that were contributed to Clearwire in November 2008.Financing Activities Net cash used in financing activities was $905 million during 2010 compared to net cash used by financing activities of $919 million in 2009. Activities in 2010 included a $750 million debt payment in June 2010 and a $51 million payment for debt financing costs associated with our new revolving credit facility. In addition, in the fourth quarter 2010, we exercised an option to terminate our relationship with a variable interest entity, which resulted in the repayment of financing, capital lease and other obligations of $105 million.Net cash used in financing activities was $919 million during 2009 as compared to net cash used in financing activities of $484 million in 2008. Activities in 2009 include debt repayments of $600 million of senior notes in May 2009, the early redemption of $607 million of our convertible senior notes in September 2009, and a $1.0 billion payment on our revolving bank credit facility in November 2009 offset by the issuance of $1.3 billion of senior notes in August 2009. Net cash used in financing activities was $484 million during 2008. Activities in 2008 include the draw down of $2.5 billion under our revolving bank credit facility in February 2008, the net proceeds from the financing obligation with TowerCo Acquisition LLC related to a sale and subsequent leaseback of multiple tower locations in September 2008 of $645 million, and proceeds from the issuance of commercial paper of $681 million, offset by the early redemption of $1.25 billion of our senior notes in June 2008, the extinguishment in September 2008 of $235 million of US Unwired Inc.s 10% Second Priority Senior Secured Notes due 2012, the extinguishment in September 2008 of $250 million of Alamosa (Delaware), Inc.s 8.5% Senior Notes due 2012, the repayment of $1.5 billion of our revolving bank credit facility in the third and fourth quarters of 2008 and maturities of commercial paper of $1.1 billion.We received $8 million, $4 million and $57 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, in proceeds from common share issuances, primarily resulting from exercises of employee options.Liquidity As of December 31, 2010, our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $5.5 billion. On May 21, 2010, we entered into a new $2.1 billion unsecured revolving credit facility that expires in October 2013. This new credit facility replaced the $4.5 billion credit facility that was due to expire in December 2010. As of December 31, 2010, $1.4 billion in letters of credit, including a $1.3 billion letter of credit required by the Report and Order to reconfigure the 800 MHz band, were outstanding under our $2.1 billion revolving bank credit facility. As a result of the outstanding letters of credit, which directly reduce the availability of the revolving bank credit facility, we had $700 million of borrowing capacity available under our revolving bank credit facility as of December 31, 2010. Accordingly, Sprints liquidity as of December 31, 2010, including cash, cash equivalents, short term investments and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility was $6.2 billion. In addition, in January 2011, $1.65 billion of Sprint Capital Corporation 7.625% senior notes were repaid upon maturity and we amended $500 million of our $750 million Export Development Canada loan to extend the maturity date from 2012 to 2015.The terms and conditions of our revolving bank credit facility require the ratio of total indeb tedness to trailing four quarters earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other non recurring items, as defined by the credit facility (adjusted EBITDA), to be no more than 4.5 to 1.0. Beginning in April 2012, the ratio will be reduced to 4.25 to 1.0, and further reduced to 4.0 to 1.0 in January 2013. As of December 31, 2010, the ratio was 3.7 to 1.0 as compared to 3.5 to 1.0 as of December 31, 2009 resulting from our decline in adjusted EBITDA. Under this revolving bank credit facility, we are currently restricted from paying cash dividends because our ratio of total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA exceeds 2.5 to 1.0. The terms of the revolving bank credit facility provi de for an interest rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin of between 2.75% and 3.50%, depending on our debt ratings. Certain of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the revolving bank credit facility. A default under our borrowings could trigger defaults under our other debt obligations, which in turn could result in the maturities being accelerated. Certain indentures that govern our outstanding notes also require compliance with various covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness and liens by the Company and its subsidiaries, as defined by the terms of the indentures. As of December 31, 2010, we own a 54% economic interest in Clearwire. As a res ult, Clearwire could be considered a subsidiary under certain agreements relating to our indebtedness. Whether Clearwire could be considered a subsidiary under our debt agreements is subject to interpretation. In December 2010, as a result of an amendment to the Clearwire equityholders agreement, Sprint obtained the right to unilaterally surrender voting securities to reduce its voting security percentage below 50%, which could eliminate the potential for Clearwire to be considered a subsidiary of Sprint. 36Table of ContentsCertain actions or defaults by Clearwire would, if viewed as a subsidiary, result in a breach of covenants, including potential cross default provisions, under certain agreements relating to our indebtedness. However, we believe the unilateral rights obtained in December significantly mitigate the possibility of an event that would cross default against Sprints debt obligations. We expect to remain in compliance with our covenants through at least the end of 2012, although there can be no assurance that we will do so. Although we expect to improve our postpaid subscriber results, if we do not meet our plan, depending on the severity of the actual subscriber results versus what we currently anticipate, it is possible that we would not remain in compliance w ith our covenants or be able to meet our debt service obligations, which could result in acceleration of our indebtedness. If such unforeseen events occur, we may engage with our lenders to obtain appropriate waivers or amendments of our credit facilities or refinance borrowings, although there is no assurance we would be successful in any of these actions. Sprints current liquidity position makes it likely that we will be able to meet our debt service requirements and other funding needs currently identified through at least the end of 2012 by using our anticipated cash flows from operating activities as well as our cash and cash equivalents on hand. In addition, we also have available the remaining borrowing capacity under our revolving bank credit facility. Nevertheless, if we are unable to continue to reduce the rate of losses of postpaid subscribe rs, it could have a significant negative impact on cash provided by operating activities and our liquidity in future years. In determining that we expect to meet our funding needs through at least 2012, we have considered: &bull; expenses relating to our operations; &bull; anticipated levels of capital expenditures, including the capacity and upgrading of our networks and the deployment of new technologies in our networks, and FCC license acquisitions; &bull; antic ipated payments under the Report and Order, as supplemented; &bull; any contributions we may make to our pension plan; &bull; scheduled debt service requirements; &bull; any additional investment we may choose to make in Clearwire; and &bull; other future contractual obligations and general corporate expenditures. Any of these events or circumstances could involve significant additional funding needs in excess of anticipated cash flows from operating activities and the identified currently available funding sources, including existing cash and cash equivalents and borrowings available under our existing revolving credit facility. If existing capital resources are not sufficient to meet these funding needs, it would be necessary to raise additional capital to meet those needs. Our ability to fund our capital needs from outside sources is ultimately affected by the overall capacity and terms of the banking and securities markets, as well as our performance and our credit ratings. Given our recent financial performance as well as the volatility in these markets, we continue to monitor them closely and to take steps to maintain financial flexibility and a reasonable cost of capital. As of December 31, 2010, Moodys Investor Service, Standard & Poors Ratings Services, and Fitch Ratings had assigned the following credit ratings to certain of our outstanding obligations:  Rating Rating Agency Senior UnsecuredBank CreditFacility SeniorUnsecured Debt OutlookMoodys Baa2 Ba3 Under ReviewStandard and Poors Not&nbsp ;Rated BB NegativeFitch BB BB  NegativeDowngrades of our current ratings do not accelerate scheduled principal payments of our existing debt. However, downgrades may cause us to incur higher interest costs on our credit facilities and future borrowings, if any, and could negatively impact our access to the public capital markets. As of December 31, 2010, we had working capital of $2.0 billion compared to $1.8 billion as of December 31, 2009. 37Table of ContentsCURRENT BUSINESS OUTLOOK We endeavor to both add new and retain our existing wireless subscribers in order to reverse the net loss in postpaid wireless subscribers that we have experienced. We expect to improve our subscriber trends by continuing to improve the customer experience and through offers which provide value, simplicity and productivity. Given the current economic environment, the difficulties the economic uncertainties create in forecasting, as well as the inherent uncertainties in predicting future customer behavior, we are unable to forecast with assurance the net retail postpaid subscriber results we will experience during 2011 or thereafter. However, the Company expects postpaid subscriber net additions for the full year 2011 and to improve total wireless subscriber net additions in 2011, as compared to 2010. Our net subscriber losses have significantly reduced our revenue and opera ting cash flow. These effects will continue if we do not continue to attract new subscribers and or reduce our rate of churn. See Effects on our Wireless Business of Postpaid Subscriber Losses above for a discussion of how our subscriber trends will impact our segment earnings trends. Also, subscriber losses will further decrease our adjusted EBITDA, as defined by our revolving bank credit facility. Management implemented cost reduction programs designed to decrease our cost structure by reducing our labor and other costs; however, we do not expect that the reduction in costs will fully offset the revenue declines described above. The above discussion is subject to the risks and other cautionary and qualifying factors set forth under &mdash;Forward Looking Statements and Part I, I tem 1A Risk Factors in this report. 38Table of Contents FUTURE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments as of December 31, 2010. Future events, including additional purchases of our securities and refinancing of those securities, could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts. See &mdash;Forward Looking Statements. Future Contractual Obligations Total 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 andthereafter (in millions)Senior notes, bank credit facilities and debentures(1) $30,586 $2,969 $3,914 $2,831 $2,261 $3,007 $15,604 Capital leases and financing obligation(2) 1,748 84 86 87 82 82 1,327 Operating leases(3) 13,392 1,694  1,705 1,576 1,415 1,136 5,866 Purchase orders and other commitments(4) 11,788 7,166 1,925 1,227&nb sp; 589 326 555 Total $57,514 $11,913 $7,630 $5,721 $4,347 $4,551 $23,352 (1) Includes principal and estimated interest payments. Interest payments are based on managements expectations for future interest rates. In January 2011, $500 million of our $750 million Export Development Canada loan was amended to extend the maturity date from 2012 to 2015, which is not reflected in the table above.(2) Represents capital lease payments including interest and financing obligation related to the sale and subsequent leaseback of multiple tower sites. (3) Includes future lease costs related to cell and switch sites, real estate, network equipment and office space. (4) Includes service, spectrum, network capacity and other executory contracts. Excludes blanket purchase orders in the amount of $44 million. See below for further discussion. Purchase orders and other commitments include m inimum purchases we commit to purchase from suppliers over time and or the unconditional purchase obligations where we guarantee to make a minimum payment to suppliers for goods and services regardless of whether suppliers fully deliver them. Amounts actually paid under some of these other agreements will likely be higher due to variable components of these agreements. The more significant variable components that determine the ultimate obligation owed include hours contracted, subscribers and other factors. In addition, we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and create an obligation to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the delivery of functioning software or products. Because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements, no such amounts have been included in the table above. The table above also excludes about $44 million of blanket purchase order amounts since their agreement terms are not specified. No time frame is set for these purchase orders and they are not legally binding. As a result, they are not firm commitments. Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $228 million as of December 31, 2010. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the timing of the resolution of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular year(s) in the table. The table above does not include remaining costs to be paid in connection with the fulfillment of our obligations under the Report and Order. The Report and Order requires us to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury at the conclusion of the band reconfiguration process to the extent that the value of the 1.9 GHz spectrum we received exceeds the total of the value of licenses for spectrum in the 700 MHz and 800 MHz bands that we surrendered under the decision plus the actual costs, or qualifying costs, that we incur to retune incumbents and our own facilities. The total minimum cash obligation for the Report and Order is $2.8 billion. From the inception of the program through December 31, 2010, we have incurred approximately $2.8 billion of costs directly attributable to the spectrum reconfiguration program. This amount does not include any of our internal network costs that we have preliminarily allocated to the reconfiguration program for capacity sites and modifications for which we may request credit under the reconfiguration program. We estimate, based on our experience to date with the reconfiguration program and on information currently available, that our total direct costs attributable to complete the spectrum reconfigurations will range between $3.4 and $3.7 billion. Accordingly, we believe that it is unlikely that we will be required to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury. OFF BALANCE SHEET FINANCING We do not participate in, or secure, financings for any unconsolidated, special purpose entities. 39Table of ContentsCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Sprint applies those accounting policies that management believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Sprints more critical accounting policies include those related to the basis of presentation, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation and recoverability of our equity method investment in Clearwire, valuation and recoverability of long lived assets, evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived assets for impairment, and accruals for taxes based on income. Inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management. Management periodically updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment. These critical accounting policies have been discussed with Sprints Board of Directors. Sprints significant accounting policies are summarized in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Sprint and its consolidated subsidiaries. Investments where Sprint maintains majority ownership, but lacks full decision making ability over all major issues, are accounted for using the equity method. Governa nce for Sprints major unconsolidated investment, Clearwire, is based on Clearwire board representation for which Sprint does not have a majority vote. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from failure of our subscribers to make required payments. Our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts considers a number of factors, including collection experience, aging of the accounts receivable portfolios, credit quality of the subscriber base, estimated proceeds from future bad debt sales and other qualitative considerations. To the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends, the required allowance amounts could differ from our estimate. A 10% change in the amount estimated to be uncollectible would result in a corresponding change in bad debt expense of about $19 million for the Wireless segment and $1 million for the Wireline segment. Valuation and Recoverability of our Equity Method Investment in Clearwire We assess our equity method investment for other than temporary impairment when indicators such as decline in quoted prices in active markets indicate a value below the carrying value of our investment. This evaluation requires significant judgment regarding, but not limited to, the severity and duration of decline in market prices; the ability and intent to hold the securities until recovery; financial condition, liquidity, and near term prospects of the issuer, specific events, and other factors. Sprints assessment that an investment is not other than temporarily impaired could change in the future due to changes in facts and circumstances. Sprint owns a 54% ownership interest in Clearwire for which the carrying value as of December 31, 2010 was $3.1 billion while the value of such investment based on Clearwires closing stock price was $2.7 billion. Sprints ability to recover the carrying value of its investment depends, in part, upon Clearwires ability to obtain sufficient funding to support its operations and its ability to successfully develop, deploy, and maintain its 4G network. A decline in the estimated fair value of Clearwire that would be deemed to be other than temporary could result in a material impairment to the carrying value of our investment. We do not intend to sell our 54% economic interest in the foreseeable future, and recoverability of our equity investment is not affected by short term fluctuations in Clearwires stock price. Accordingly, we expect to fully recover the carrying value of our investment in Clearwire.Valuation and Recoverability of Long lived Assets Long lived assets consist primarily of property, pl ant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization. Changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets, as well as changes in economic or industry factors or in our business or prospects, may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change. Property, plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated economic useful lives. Certain network assets are depreciated using the group life method. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. When these factors indicate that an assets useful life is different from the previous assess ment, we depreciate the remaining book values prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. Depreciation rates for assets using the group life method are revised periodically as required under this method. Changes made as a result of depreciable life studies and rate changes generally do not have a material effect on depreciation expense. Long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Long lived asset groups were determined based upon certain factors including assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of our assets, a loss is recognized for t he difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the assets. Impairment analyses, when 40Table of Contentsperformed, are based on our current business and technology strategy, views of growth rates for our business, anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability. During 2010, we analyzed long lived assets in our Wireless segment for recoverability and, based on ou r estimate of undiscounted cash flows, determined the carrying value to be recoverable. Our estimate of undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of these assets by more than 10%. If we continue to have operational challenges, including obtaining and retaining subscribers, future cash flows of the Company may not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of our wireless asset group, and we could record asset impairments that are material to Sprints consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In addition to the analyses described above, certain assets that have not yet been deployed in the business, including network equipment, cell site development costs and software in development, are periodically assessed to determine recoverability. Network equipment and cell site development costs are expensed whenever events or changes in circumstances cause the Company to conclude the assets are no longer needed to meet managements strategic network plans and will not be deployed. Software development costs are expensed when it is no longer probable that the software project will be deployed. Network equipment that has been removed from the network is also periodically assessed to determine recoverability. If we continue to have challenges retaining subscribers and as we continue to assess the impact of rebanding the iDEN network, management may conclude in future periods that certain CDMA and iDEN assets will never be either deployed or redeployed, in which case non cash charges that could be material to our consolidated financial statements would be recognized. Evaluation of Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price paid over the fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. Sprint evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed estimated fair value. Our analysis includes a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill applies to the carrying value, including goodwill, of that reporting unit. We regularly assess whether any indicators of impairment exist, which requires a significant amount of judgment. Such indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price a nd market capitalization; a decline in our expected future cash flows; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and or slower growth rates, among others. Any adverse change in these factors could result in an impairment that could be material to our consolidated financial statements. The determination of the estimated fair value of the wireless reporting unit requires significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, transactions within the wireless industry and related control premiums, discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) and capital expenditures forecasts. Due to the inherent uncerta inty involved in making those estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. The merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit are evaluated for reasonableness. FCC licenses and our Sprint and Boost Mobile trademarks have been identified as indefinite lived intangible assets, in addition to goodwill, after considering the expected use of the assets, the regulatory and economic environment within which they are being used, and the effects of obsolescence on their use. When required, Sprint assesses the recoverability of other indefinite lived intangibles, including FCC licenses which are carried as a single unit of accounting. In assessing recoverability of FCC licenses, we estimate the fair value of such licenses using the Greenfield direct value method, w hich approximates value through estimating the discounted future cash flows of a hypothetical start up business. Assumptions key in estimating fair value under this method include, but are not limited to, capital expenditures, subscriber activations and deactivations, market share achieved, tax rates in effect and discount rate. A one percent decline in our assumed revenue growth rate used to estimate terminal value, a one percent decline in our assumed net cash flows or a one percent adverse change in any of the key assumptions referred to above would not result in an impairment of our FCC licenses as of the most recent testing date. A decline in the estimated fair value of FCC licenses of approximately 20% also would not result in an impairment of the carrying value. Accruals for Taxes Based on Income Uncertainties exist with respect to interpretation of complex U.S. federal and state tax regulations. Management expects that Sprints interpretations will prevail. Also, Sprint has recognized deferred tax benefits relating to its future utilization of past operating losses. Sprint believes it is more likely than not that the amounts of deferred tax assets in excess of the related valuation allowances will be realized. The accounting estimates related to the tax valuation allowance require us to make assumptions regarding the timing of future events, including the probability of expected future taxable income and available tax planning opportunities. These assumptions require significant judgment because actual performance has fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future. The impact that changes in actual performance versus these estimates could have on the realization of tax benefits as reported in our results of operations could be material. The accounting estimates related to the liability for unrecognized tax benefits require us to make judgments 41Table of Contentsregarding the sustainability of each uncertain tax position based on its technical merits. These estimates are updated based on the facts, circumstances and information available. We are also required to assess at each annual reporting date whether it is reasonably possible that any significant increases or decreases to the unrecognized tax benefits will occur during the next twelve months. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued authoritative literature regarding Amendments to FASB Interpretation No. 46(R), which changes various aspects of accounting for and disclosures of interests in variable interest entities, and Accounting for Transfers of Financial Assets, which was issued in order to improve the relevance, representational faithfulness, and comparability of the information that a reporting entity provides in its financial statements about a transfer of financial assets; the effects of a transfer on its financial position, financial performance, and cash flows; and a transferors continuing involvement, if any, in transferred financial assets. This guidance was effective beginning in January 2010 and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In September 2009, the FASB modified the accounting for Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements and Certain Revenue Arrangements that Include Software Elements. These modifications alter the methods previously required for allocating consideration received in multiple element arrangements to require revenue allocation based on a relative selling price method, including arrangements containing software components and non software components that function t ogether to deliver the products essential functionality. These modifications will be effective prospectively for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2011 and are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In January 2010, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding Improving Disclosures about Fair Value Measurements, which requires new and amended disclosure requirements for classes of assets and liabilities, inputs and valuation techniques and transfers between levels of fair value measurements and Accounting for Distributions to Shareholders with Components of Stock and Cash, which clarifies the accounting for distributions to shareholders that offer them the ability to elect to receive their entire distribution in cash or shares of equivalent value. This guidance was effective beginning in January 2010 and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements.In July 2010, the FASB amended the requirements for Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses. As a result of these amendments, an entity is required to disaggregate by portfolio segment or class certain existing disclosures and provide certain new disclosures about its financing receivables and related allowance for credit losses. Th e new disclosures as of the end of the reporting period are effective for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010, while the disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period are effective for the first fiscal quarter of 2011. The disclosure requirements effective for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010 did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. The requirements effective for the first fiscal quarter of 2011 are not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We include certain estimates, projections and other forward looking statements in our annual, quarterly and current reports, and in other publicly available material. Statements regarding expectations, including performance assumptions and estimates relating to capital requirements, as well as other statements that are not historical facts, are forward looking statements. These statements reflect managements judgments based on currently available information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements. With respect to these forward looking statements, management has made assumptions regarding, among other things, subscriber and network usage, subscriber growth and retention, pricing, operating costs, the timing of various events and the economic a nd regulatory environment. Future performance cannot be assured. Actual results may differ materially from those in the forward looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include:&bull; our ability to attract and retain subscribers;&bull; the ability of our competitors to offer products and services at lower prices due to lower cost structures;&bull; the effects of vigorous competition on a highly penetrated market, including the imp act of competition on the price we are able to charge subscribers for services and equipment we provide and our ability to attract new subscribers and retain existing subscribers; the overall demand for our service offerings, including the impact of decisions of new or existing subscribers between our postpaid and prepaid services offerings and between our two network platforms; and the impact of new, emerging and competing technologies on our business;&bull; the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to fully implement our network mode rnization plan to improve and enhance our networks and service offerings, implement our business strategies and provide competitive new 42Table of Contentstechnologies;&bull; the effective implementation of our network modernization plan, Network Vision, including timing, technologies, and costs;&bull; changes in available technology and the effects of such changes, including product substitutions and deployment costs;&bull; our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all; &bull; volatility in the trading price of our comm on stock, current economic conditions and our ability to access capital;&bull; the impact of unrelated parties not meeting our business requirements, including a significant adverse change in the ability or willingness of such parties to provide devices or infrastructure equipment for our CDMA network, or Motorolas ability or willingness to provide related devices, infrastructure equipment and software applications for our iDEN network;&bull; the costs and business risks associated with providing new services and entering new geographic markets; &bull; the financial performance of Clearwire and its de ployment of a 4G network;&bull; the impact of difficulties we may encounter in connection with the continued integration of the business and assets of Virgin Mobile, including the risk that these difficulties may limit our ability to fully integrate the operations of this business; &bull; the effects of mergers and consolidations and new entrants in the communications industry and unexpected announcements or developments from others in the communications industry; &bull; unexpected results of litigation filed against us or our suppliers or vendors;&bull; the impact of adverse network performance;&bull; the costs or potential customer impacts of compliance with regul atory mandates including, but not limited to, compliance with the FCCs Report and Order to reconfigure the 800 MHz band;&bull; equipment failure, natural disasters, terrorist acts or other breaches of network or information technology security;&bull; one or more of the markets in which we compete being impacted by changes in political, economic or other factors such as monetary policy, legal and regulatory changes or other external factors over which we have no control; and &bull; other risks referenced from time to time in this report, including in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors and other filings of ours with the SEC.The words may, could, estimate, project, forecast, intend, expect, believe, target, plan, providing guidance and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are found throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and elsewhere in this report. Readers are cautioned that other factors, although not listed above, could also materially affect our future performance and operating results. The reader should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We are not obligated to publicl y release any revisions to forward looking statements to reflect events after the date of this report, including unforeseen events. FINANCIAL STRATEGIES General Risk Management Policies Our board of directors has adopted a financial risk management policy that authorizes us to enter into derivative transactions, and all transactions comply with the policy. We do not purchase or ho ld any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes with the exception of equity rights obtained in connection with commercial agreements or strategic investments, usually in the form of warrants to purchase common shares. Derivative instruments are primarily used for hedging and risk management purposes. Hedging activities may be done for various purposes, including, but not limited to, mitigating the risks associated with an asset, liability, committed transaction or probable forecasted transaction. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through stringent credit approval and review processes, credit support agreements, continual review and monitoring of all counterparties, and thorough legal review of contracts. Exposure to market risk is controlled by regularly monitoring changes in hedge positions under normal and stress conditions to ensure they do not exceed established limits. Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are primarily exposed to the market risk associated with unfavorable movements in interest rates, f oreign 43Table of Contentscurrencies, and equity prices. The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors. Interest Rate Risk The communications industry is a capital intensive, technology driven business. We are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our borrowings. Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows. Specific interest rate risk includes: the risk of increasing interest rates on floating rate debt and the risk of increasing interest rates for planned new fixed rate long term financings or refinancings. About 86% of our debt as of December 31, 201 0 was fixed rate debt. While changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt, there is no impact to earnings and cash flows because we intend to hold these obligations to maturity unless market and other conditions are favorable. We perform interest rate sensitivity analyses on our variable rate debt. These analyses indicate that a one percentage point change in interest rates would have an annual pre tax impact of $27 million on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2010. We also perform a sensitivity analysis on the fair market value of our outstanding debt. A 10% decline in market interest rates would cause a $751 million increase in the fair market value of our debt to $20.8 billion. Foreign Currency Risk We also enter into forward contracts and options in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. O ur foreign exchange risk management program focuses on reducing transaction exposure to optimize consolidated cash flow. We use foreign currency derivatives to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to settlement of international telecommunications access charges and the operation of our international subsidiaries. The dollar equivalent of our net foreign currency payables from international settlements was $7 million and the net foreign currency receivables from international operations were $4 million as of December 31, 2010. The potential immediate pre tax loss to us that would result from a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates based on these positions would be insignificant. Equity Risk We are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments. We invest in equity instruments of public companies for operational and strategic business purposes. These securities are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to volatility of the stock market and industries in which the companies operate. These securities, which are classified in investments on the consolidated balance sheets, primarily include equity method investments, such as our investment in Clearwire and available for sal e securities. In certain business transactions, we are granted warrants to purchase the securities of other companies at fixed rates. These warrants are supplemental to the terms of the business transaction and are not designated as hedging instruments.
