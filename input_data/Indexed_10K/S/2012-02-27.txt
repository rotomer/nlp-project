(Virgin Mobile) in 2009 and Affiliates in 2007 and 2009, as well as the November 2008 contribution of our next generation wireless network to Clearwire. The acquired companies results of operations subsequent to their acquisition dates are included in our consolidated financial statements. The primary reason for the increase in net operating revenues for 2011 as compared to the prior year was an increase in postpaid average revenue per subscriber and total retail wireless subscribers net additions of 2.4 million. The 2010 increase in net operating revenues as compared to the prior year was primarily related to the total retail wireless subscribers net additions of 783,000 and the additional subscribers obtained in our 2009 acquisitions. We lost approximately 1.0 million retail wireless subscribers in 2009 and 5.1 million in 2008, which caused the majority of the reduction in net operating revenues in those periods.

In 2010, operating loss improved $803 million primarily due to the increase in net operating revenues of $303 million in addition to decreases in operating expenses of $500 million as a result of our cost cutting initiatives in prior periods. In 2009, we recognized net charges of $389 million ($248 million after tax) primarily related to severance and exit costs and asset impairments other than goodwill. In 2008, we recognized net charges of $936 million ($586 million after tax) primarily related to asset impairments other than goodwill, severance and exit costs, and merger and integration costs. In 2007, we recognized net charges of $956 million ($590 million after tax) primarily related to merger and integration costs, asset impairments other than goodwill, and severance and exit costs. (2)During 2011 and 2010, the Company did not recognize significant tax benefits associated with federal and state net operating losses generated during the periods due to its history of consecutive annual losses. As a result, the Company recognized an increase in the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets affecting the income tax provision by approximately $1.2 billion, $1.4 billion, and $281 million for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.(3)We did not declare any dividends on our common shares in 2011, 2010, 2009, and 2008. In each quarter of 2007, the dividend was $0.025 per share. 26Table of ContentsItem 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Business Strategies and Key Priorities Sprint is a communications company offering a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications products and services that are designed to meet the needs of individual consumers, businesses, government subscribers and resellers. The communications industry has been and will continue to be highly competitive on the basis of the quality of service, the types of services and devices offered, and price. As discussed below in Effects on our Wireless Business of Postpaid Subscriber Losses, the Company has experienced significant losses of subscribers in the critical postpaid wireless market since the third quarter 2006, but, as a result of steps taken to retain and attract such subscribers, has reduced annual postpaid net subscriber losses beginning in 2009.Our business strategy is to be responsive to changing customer mobility demands by being innovative and differentiated in the marketplace. Our future growth plans and strategy revolve around achieving the following three key priorities: Improve the customer experience; Strengthen our brands; andGenerate operating cash flow. We have reduced confusion over pricing plans and complex bills with our Simply Everything and Everything Data plans and our Any Mobile Anytime feature. We also offer price plans tailored to business subscribers such as Business Advantage, which allows for the flexibility to mix and match plans that include voice, voice and messaging, or voice, messaging and data to meet individual business needs and also allows the Any Mobile Anytime feature with certain plans. To simplify and improve the customer experience, we continue to offer Ready Now, which trains our customers before they leave the store on how to use their mobile devices. For our business customers, we aim to increase their productivity by providing differentiated services that utilize the advantages of combining IP networks with wireless technology. This differentiation enables us to retain and acquire both wireline, wireless and combined wireline wireless subscribers on our networks. We have also continued to focus on further improving customer care. We implemented initiatives that are designed to improve call center processes and procedures, and standardized our performance measures through various metrics, including customer satisfaction ratings with respect to customer care, first call resolution, and calls per subscriber. Our product strategy is to provide our customers with a broad array of device selections and applications and services that run on these devices to meet the growing needs of customer mobility. Our multi functional device portfolio includes many cutting edge devices from various original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Our mobile broadband portfolio consists of devices such as hotspots, which allow the connection of multiple WiFi enabled devices. Our networks can also be accessed through our portfolio of embedded tablets and laptop devices. We support the open development of applications, content and devices on our network platforms through products and services such as Google Voice as well as Google Wallet, which is an application using near field communication technology to enable smartphones to make purchases at select merchants. We have also launched multiple Sprint ID packs that download applications, widgets and other content related to a persons interests at the push of a button. In addition, we enable a variety of business and consumer third party relationships through our portfolio of machine to machine solutions, which we offer on a retail postpaid and wholesale basis. The machine to machine solutions portfolio provides a secure, real time and reliable wireless two way data connection across a broad range of connected devices including OEM devices and after market in vehicle connectivity and electric vehicle charging stations, point of sale systems, kiosks and vending machines, asset tracking, digital signage, security, smartgrid utilities, medical equipment, and a variety of other consumer electronics and appliances. Our prepaid portfolio includes multiple brands, each designed to appeal to specific customer segments. Boost Mobile serves subscribers who are voice and text messaging centric with its popular Monthly Unlimited plan with Shrinkage service where bills are reduced after six on time payments. Virgin Mobile serves subscribers who are device and data oriented with Beyond Talk plans and our broadband plan, Broadband2Go, that offer consumers control, flexibility, and connectivity through various communication vehicles. Assurance Wireless provides eligible subscribers, who meet income requirements or are receiving government assistance, with a free wireless phone and 27Table of Contents250 free minutes of national, local, and long distance monthly service.We have focused our wholesale business to enable our diverse network of customers to successfully grow their business by providing them with an array of network, product, and device solutions. This allows our customers to customize this full suite of value added solutions to meet the growing demands of their business. In addition to our brand and customer oriented goals, we continue to focus on generating increased operating cash flow through competitive rate plans for postpaid and prepaid subscribers, multi branded strategies, and effectively managing our cost structure to align with reduced revenues from fewer postpaid subscribers. Certain of our strategic decisions, such as Network Vision and the introduction of the iPhone, which on average carries a higher equipment net subsidy, will result in a reduction in cash flows from operations in the near term. However, we believe these actions will generate long term benefits, including growth in valuable postpaid subscribers, a reduction in variable cost of service per unit and long term accretion to cash flows from operations. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information. Network VisionIn December 2010, we announced Network Vision, a multi year network infrastructure initiative intended to provide subscribers with an enhanced network experience by improving voice quality, coverage, and data speeds, while enhancing network flexibility, reducing operating costs, and improving environmental sustainability through the utilization of multiple spectrum bands onto a single multi mode base station. In addition to implementing these multi mode base stations, this plan encompasses next generation push to talk technology with broadband capabilities and the integration of multi mode chipsets into smartphones, tablets and other broadband devices, including machine to machine products. Through the successful deployment of Network Vision, we expect to migrate to a single nationwide network allowing for the consolidation and optimization of our 800 megahertz (MHz) and 1.9 gigahertz (GHz) spectrum, as well as other spectrum owned by third parties, into multi mode stations allowing us to repurpose spectrum to enhance coverage, particularly around the in building experience. The multi mode technology also utilizes software based solutions with interchangeable hardware to provide greater network flexibility, which also allows for the deployment of LTE.The first stages of equipment testing began in the first quarter of 2011, and we have achieved our initial technical milestones. Deployment has begun on approximately 38,000 cell sites, and we powered on our first multi mode base station on December 6, 2011. We expect to commercially launch this new technology in certain markets by mid year 2012. On October 2, 2011, we launched Sprint Direct Connect, which is the next generation of push to talk technology. Further deployments of Network Vision technology, including enhancements of Sprint Direct Connect, are expected to continue through early 2014. We expect the plan to bring financial benefit to the Company through migration to one common network, which is expected to reduce network maintenance and operating costs through capital efficiencies, reduced energy costs, lower roaming expenses, backhaul savings, and the eventual reduction in total cell sites. The successful deployment related to these changes in technology will result in incremental charges during the period of implementation including, but not limited to, an increase in depreciation and amortization associated with existing assets, both Nextel and Sprint platform related, due to changes in our estimates of the remaining useful lives of long lived assets, and the expected timing of asset retirement obligations, which we expect will have a material impact on our results of operations. We recorded a charge of $78 million related to network equipment, which has not been placed into service and that is no longer necessary for managements strategic plans. In the first quarter of 2012, we formalized our plans to decommission roughly one third of our total Nextel platform, or 9,600 towers, by the end of 2012. We also expect to be completed with our transition of customers from the Nextel platform to our Sprint platform by the end of 2013, which should allow us to decommission the remainder of our Nextel platform sites. As a result, in the first quarter 2012, we revised our estimates of the expected useful lives of certain Nextel platform assets and asset retirement obligations through the end of 2013. Accordingly, approximately $2 billion of the remaining $3.6 billion net book value of Nextel platform assets is expected to be accelerated through depreciation expense, of which a disproportionate amount is expected to be recognized during 2012. The exact timing of the acceleration is dependent upon when the assets are expected to be phased out of service. These estimates are derived from our internal decommissioning plan, which is still evolving. We estimate the incremental effect of accelerated depreciation related to Nextel platform assets in our 2012 results to be in the range of approximately $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. 28Table of ContentsIn addition, we are experiencing increased data usage by subscribers, which has required additional capital expenditures of data capacity equipment on our current Sprint platform. As we deploy Network Vision, we intend to maximize the use of previously deployed data capacity equipment when possible; however, based on our capacity needs during the implementation period of Network Vision, we expect additional data capacity expenditures that will not be compatible with the deployment of Network Visions multi mode technology. As a result, the estimated useful lives of such equipment will be shortened, as compared to similar prior capital expenditures, through the date in which Network Vision equipment is deployed and in service. Spectrum HostingOur Network Vision multi mode network technology is designed to utilize a single base station capable of handling various spectrum bands, including our 800 MHz and 1.9 GHz spectrum as well as spectrum bands owned or accessed by other parties. In June 2011, we entered into a 15 year arrangement with LightSquared LP and LightSquared Inc. (collectively, LightSquared). Under the terms of the arrangement, and in conjunction with our Network Vision deployment, we agreed to deploy and operate an LTE network capable of utilizing the 1.6 GHz spectrum licensed to or available to LightSquared during the term of the arrangement, a service we refer to as spectrum hosting. The arrangement contains contingencies related to possible interference issues with LightSquareds spectrum, including the right of Sprint to terminate the arrangement if certain conditions are not met by LightSquared. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had received $310 million of advanced payments from LightSquared for future services to be performed under the spectrum hosting agreement.Beginning in December 2011, through a series of amendments, the arrangement was modified to, among other things, extend the date in which Sprint has the right to terminate the arrangement and suspend Sprints obligation to incur any further cost or expense related to performance under the original agreement. Under the amended arrangement, Sprint, for any reason, including but not limited to FCC action or inaction, or no reason at all, may terminate the agreement after March 15, 2012 and before April 30, 2012. If LightSquared secures lenders consent for modifications to the agreement, Sprints right to terminate will be deferred until June 25, 2012 and will continue through December 31, 2012. In addition, the parties definitively agreed that approximately $236 million of the total $310 million of advanced payments made by LightSquared represent payment for incremental costs or obligations incurred by Sprint under the original agreement in support of LightSquared. The parties agreed that this amount is irrevocably and unconditionally paid and will not be subject to dispute or claim by LightSquared. Accordingly, Sprint will refund up to approximately $74 million of Lightsquareds initial prepayments, of which $65 million will be paid on the earlier of LightSquareds lenders consent or March 15, 2012, and the remaining $9 million will remain subject to the termination and unwind provisions of the original agreement and will be returned to LightSquared upon termination, less any additional incremental cost or obligations incurred by Sprint in support of LightSquared. In the event the arrangement is terminated for LightSquareds material breach, non payment or insolvency, Sprint maintains a second lien on certain of LightSquareds assets, including spectrum assets.The $236 million, which has been recorded as a current liability, will be recognized as other operating income, net of the associated costs, in the event of termination assuming all other uncertainties have been resolved. Alternatively, should Sprint and LightSquared agree to proceed with the hosting arrangement, the $236 million will be recognized as revenue as the hosting services are performed.Effects on our Wireless Business of Postpaid Subscriber Losses The following table shows annual net additions/(losses) of postpaid subscribers by platform for the past five years, excluding subscribers obtained through business combinations. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 ( in thousands)Sprint platform net additions/(losses)1,283 734 (1,191) (437) 3,131Nextel platform net losses(1,381) (1,589) (2,355) (3,636) (4,355)Total net losses of postpaid subscribers(98) (855) (3,546) (4,073) (1,224)As shown by the table below under Results of Operations, Wireless segment earnings represented approximately 84% of our total consolidated segment earnings in 2011. The wireless industry is subject to competition to retain and acquire subscribers of wireless services. Most markets in which we operate have high rates 29Table of Contentsof penetration for wireless services. Wireless carriers accordingly must attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from competitors rather than from first time subscribers. Within the Wireless segment, postpaid wireless services represent the most significant contributors to earnings, and are driven by the number of postpaid subscribers to our services, as well as the average revenue per subscriber or user (ARPU). To address and reduce net postpaid subscriber losses, we have taken initiatives to strengthen the Sprint brand and continue to increase market awareness of the improvements that have been achieved in the customer experience, including the speed and dependability of our networks. We have also introduced new devices, including the iPhone in the fourth quarter of 2011, improving our overall lineup and providing a competitive portfolio for customer selection, as well as competitive rate plans providing simplicity and value.The Company has significantly improved net postpaid subscriber results subsequent to the first quarter 2009 as a result of actions taken to improve customer service, device selection and value oriented service offerings. In conjunction with Network Vision, the Company continues to focus on the growth of the Sprint platform while simultaneously targeting retention of Nextel platform customers through competitive offerings on the Sprint platform, which includes Sprint Direct Connect. As a result of our plans, we expect that customer churn on the Nextel platform, both postpaid and prepaid, will increase as we progress toward the decommissioning of the Nextel platform as well as increased competition for these subscribers. Although the Company continues to experience net losses of Nextel platform postpaid subscribers, these subscribers generally have a lower ARPU and have been partially offset by net additions of Sprint platform postpaid subscribers which, on average, carry a higher ARPU. For the year ended December 31, 2011, net postpaid subscriber losses of 98,000 represent an improvement of 757,000, or 89% compared to the same period one year ago and net prepaid subscriber additions of 2.5 million represent an improvement of 874,000, or 53% compared to the same period one year ago. Wireless retail service revenue has begun to grow primarily due to the increased service revenue associated with our prepaid wireless offerings and increased postpaid ARPU due primarily to the $10 premium data add on charge associated with smartphones. If our trend of improved postpaid subscriber results does not continue, it could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity in 2012 and beyond. The Company believes the actions that have been taken, as described above, and that continue to be taken in marketing, customer service, device offerings, and network quality, should continue to improve net postpaid subscriber results.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions)Wireless segment earnings$4,267 $4,531 $5,198Wireline segment earnings800 1,090 1,221Corporate, other and eliminations5 12 (12)Consolidated segment earnings5,072 5,633 6,407Depreciation and amortization(4,858) (6,248) (7,416)Other, net(106)20(389)Operating income (loss)108 (595) (1,398)Interest expense(1,011) (1,464) (1,450)Equity in losses of unconsolidated investments, net(1,730) (1,286) (803)Other (expense) income, net(3) 46 157Income tax (expense) benefit(254) (166) 1,058Net loss$(2,890) $(3,465) $(2,436)Consolidated segment earnings decreased $561 million, or 10%, in 2011 compared to 2010 and $774 million, or 12%, in 2010 compared to 2009. Consolidated segment earnings consist of our Wireless and Wireline segments, which are discussed below, and Corporate, other and eliminations. 30Table of ContentsDepreciation and Amortization Expense During 2011, Sprint completed studies of the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets, which reflects a reduction in the replacement rate of capital additions and was a primary factor for a decrease to depreciation expense of $619 million, or 12%, in 2011 compared to 2010. This decline is partially offset by an increase due to assets placed in service as a result of capital expenditures related to capacity to support increased data usage by our subscribers. As a result of expected increased capital expenditures related to Network Vision, we expect depreciation expense to increase over the next several years as those assets are placed in service. In addition, the successful deployment related to the changes in technology as a result of Network Vision is expected to result in incremental charges during the period of implementation including, but not limited to, an increase in depreciation and amortization associated with existing assets, both Nextel and Sprint platform related, due to changes in our estimates of the remaining useful lives of long lived assets, and the expected timing of asset retirement obligations, which we expect to have a material impact on our results of operations. Depreciation expense decreased $753 million, or 13%, in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a reduction in the replacement rate of capital additions resulting from reduced capital spending associated with our cost control actions beginning in 2008. The average annual capital expenditures for the three years ended 2007 were approximately $6.3 billion as compared to average annual capital expenditures of $2.5 billion for the three years ended 2010. Amortization expense declined $771 million, or 66%, in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the absence of amortization for customer relationship intangible assets related to the 2005 acquisition of Nextel, which became fully amortized in the second quarter 2010. In addition, customer relationship intangible assets related to the acquisition of Nextel Partners, Inc. in 2006 and Virgin Mobile USA, Inc. (Virgin Mobile) in the fourth quarter 2009 became fully amortized in the second quarter 2011. Amortization expense declined $415 million, or 26%, in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily due to the absence of amortization for customer relationship intangible assets related to the 2005 acquisition of Nextel which became fully amortized in the second quarter 2010. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in amortization related to customer relationship intangible assets acquired in connection with the iPCS, Inc. (iPCS) and Virgin Mobile acquisitions in the fourth quarter 2009. Customer relationships are amortized using the sum of the years digits method, resulting in higher amortization rates in early periods that decline over time. Other, net The following table provides additional information of items included in Other, net for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

During 2011 we recognized severance and exit costs of $28 million associated with actions in the fourth quarter of 2011. During 2010 we recognized $8 million of severance and exit costs primarily related to exit costs incurred in the second and fourth quarter 2010 associated with vacating certain office space which is no longer being utilized. We recognized $400 million in 2009 of severance and exit costs related to the separation of employees and organizational realignment initiatives. Asset impairments decreased by $47 million, or 38%, in 2011 compared to 2010 and increased $78 million, or 166%, in 2010 compared to 2009. Asset impairments primarily relate to assets that are no longer necessary for managements strategic plans. In 2011, 2010, and 2009 these impairments were primarily related to network asset equipment. Gains from asset dispositions and exchanges for 2010 and 2009 are primarily related to spectrum exchange transactions. Other changed $94 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in benefits resulting from favorable developments relating to access cost disputes with certain exchange carriers. 31Table of ContentsInterest Expense Interest expense decreased $453 million, or 31%, in 2011 as compared to 2010, primarily due to a $400 million increase in the amount of interest capitalized. The increase in capitalized interest is related to our plan to deploy certain spectrum licenses as part of Network Vision that were not previously utilized. The reduction in interest expense also includes a decrease of $115 million as a result of the repayment of $1.65 billion of Sprint Capital Corporation 7.625% senior notes in January 2011. The decrease was partially offset by increases in interest expense of $54 million as a result of the November 2011 Sprint Nextel Corporation issuance of $1 billion in principal of 11.50% senior notes due 2021 and $3 billion in principal of 9.00% guaranteed notes due 2018. Interest expense increased $14 million, or 1%, in 2010 as compared to 2009. This increase was primarily due to higher effective interest rates on our average long term debt balances and increased costs on our revolving credit facilities, which include the accelerated amortization of previously unamortized debt issuance costs from the retirement of our former credit facility in May 2010 partially offset by reductions in interest expense previously recorded as a result of favorable tax outcomes. The effective interest rate, which includes capitalized interest, on the weighted average long term debt balance of $19.1 billion, $20.6 billion, and $21.4 billion was 7.4%, 7.2%, and 6.8% for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information on the Companys financing activities. Equity in Losses of Unconsolidated Investments, net Clearwire owns and operates a next generation mobile broadband network that provides high speed residential and mobile Internet access services and residential voice services in communities throughout the country. Clearwire is an early stage company, and as such, heavily invested in building its network and acquiring other assets necessary to expand its WiMAX business during 2009 and 2010, which resulted in increased operating losses and reduced liquidity. In August 2011, Clearwire announced its intention to deploy an LTE network subject to the availability of additional funding. In December 2011, Clearwire issued additional equity and raised net proceeds of approximately $716 million. Additionally, in January 2012, Clearwire issued additional indebtedness and raised net proceeds of approximately $295 million. We expect Clearwire to continue to generate net losses in the near term as it executes its business plan, including the deployment of an LTE network. Our intent to hold our investment in Clearwire is based, in part, on our growing subscriber base of 4G WiMAX subscribers that utilize Clearwires network and our intent to sell 4G WiMAX devices through 2012.Equity in losses of unconsolidated investments primarily consists of our proportionate share of losses from our equity method investments. Equity losses associated with our investment in Clearwire consists of Sprints share of Clearwires net loss and other adjustments such as gains or losses associated with the dilution of Sprints ownership interest resulting from Clearwires equity issuances and other items recognized by Clearwire Corporation that do not effect Sprints economic interest. Equity in losses from Clearwire were $1.7 billion, $1.3 billion, and $803 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Equity in losses from Clearwire for 2011 and 2010 include charges of approximately $361 million and $97 million respectively, which are associated with Clearwires write off of certain network and other assets that no longer meet their strategic plans. The year ended December 31, 2011 also includes a $135 million pre tax impairment reflecting the reduction of our investment in Clearwire to its estimated fair value and a dilution loss of approximately $27 million associated with the fourth quarter reduction of our non controlling economic interest related to Clearwires equity issuance. The 2009 equity in losses of Clearwire include a pre tax dilution loss of $154 million recognized in the first quarter 2009, representing the finalization of ownership percentages associated with the formation of Clearwire, which was subject to change based on the trading price of Clearwire stock during the 90 days subsequent to the November 2008 closing. Additional declines in the value of Clearwire may require us to evaluate the decline in relation to the carrying value of our investment in Clearwire. A conclusion by us that additional declines in the value of Clearwire are other than temporary could result in an additional impairment, which could be material.On November 30, 2011, Sprint entered into new agreements with Clearwire that established long term pricing terms for 4G services, both WiMAX and LTE. Under terms of the agreements, Sprint is required to pay Clearwire $926 million in total over the course of 2012 and 2013 in exchange for unlimited WiMAX services during those years. The agreements also establish long term usage based pricing for LTE services in 2012 and beyond and WiMAX services in 2014 and beyond. Under the terms Sprint may also make a series of refundable prepayments up to $350 million for LTE services, if Clearwire achieves certain build out targets and network specifications by June 2013 or obtains purchase commitments for LTE services from other customers. These payments, beginning in 2013, 32Table of Contentswill be applied towards LTE usage over the remaining term of the contract. In addition, the agreements provided improved terms and competitive pricing for re wholesaling of WiMAX services by Sprint beginning in 2012. Lastly, as part of the agreements, on January 2, 2012, Sprint provided $150 million to Clearwire in exchange for a promissory note with a stated interest rate of 11.5% that matures in two installments of $75 million plus accrued interest in January 2013 and in January 2014. Sprint, at its sole discretion, can choose to offset any amounts payable by Clearwire under this promissory note against amounts owed by Sprint under the MVNO agreement.Other (expense) income, net The following table provides additional information of items included in Other (expense) income, net for each of the three years ended December 31, 2011. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions)Interest income$36 $35 $34Realized loss from investments(6) (3) (29)Gain on previously held non controlling interest in Virgin Mobile 151Loss on early retirement of debt(33) Other 14 1Total$(3) $46 $157Interest income remained relatively stable for each of the periods presented. Realized loss from investments was consistent in 2011, as compared to 2010, and decreased $26 million, or 90%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to fewer sales of marketable securities. As a result of the acquisition of Virgin Mobile, a non cash gain of $151 million ($92 million after tax) was recognized in the fourth quarter 2009 related to the estimated fair value over net carrying value of our previously held non controlling interest in Virgin Mobile. The loss on early retirement of debt in 2011 was due to the redemption of all of our outstanding $2.0 billion Sprint Capital Corporation 8.375% senior notes due March 2012. Income Tax (Expense) Benefit The consolidated effective tax rate was an expense of approximately 10% and 5% in 2011 and 2010, respectively, and a benefit of approximately 30% in 2009. The income tax expense for 2011 and 2010 and the benefit for 2009 include a $1.2 billion, $1.4 billion, and $281 million net increase to the valuation allowance for federal and state deferred tax assets primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards generated during the respective periods. The 2011 increase to the valuation allowance was also inclusive of $21 million associated with federal income tax effects of recently enacted changes in corporate state income tax laws, and resulted in a total charge to income tax expense of $59 million. We do not expect to record significant tax benefits on future net operating losses until our circumstances justify the recognition of such benefits. Additional information related to items impacting the effective tax rates can be found in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 33Table of ContentsSegment Earnings Wireless Wireless segment earnings are primarily a function of wireless service revenue, costs to acquire subscribers, network and interconnection costs to serve those subscribers and other Wireless segment operating expenses. The costs to acquire our subscribers include the net cost at which we sell our devices, referred to as equipment net subsidies, as well as the marketing and sales costs incurred to attract those subscribers. Network costs primarily represent switch and cell site costs and interconnection costs, which generally consist of per minute usage fees and roaming fees paid to other carriers. The remaining costs associated with operating the Wireless segment include the costs to operate our customer care organization and administrative support. Wireless service revenue, costs to acquire subscribers, and variable network and interconnection costs fluctuate with the changes in our subscriber base and their related usage, but some cost elements do not fluctuate in the short term with these changes. Wireless segment earnings have declined consecutively for each of the annual periods ending December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011. Wireless segment earnings were approximately $4.3 billion, $4.5 billion and $5.2 billion for each of the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As discussed in the section Effects on our Wireless Business of Postpaid Subscriber Losses, the Company has significantly reduced the net postpaid subscriber losses occurring since 2009 and increased subscriber net additions within prepaid, wholesale and affiliates. During 2011, the Company entered into a purchase commitment with Apple, Inc. to purchase a minimum number of smartphones, which on average, is expected to carry a higher subsidy per unit than other smartphones we sell. In addition, during 2012, we expect to make further progress on Network Vision, including certain costs associated with the ongoing decommissioning efforts of the Nextel platform. As a result, we expect that wireless segment earnings will decline in 2012 as compared to 2011 until we benefit from Network Vision, through reduced network and operating costs, and begin to see further increases in retail service revenue through improved total retail postpaid net additions sufficient to recover these increased equipment net subsidy and acquisition costs.The following table provides an overview of the results of operations of our Wireless segment for each of the three years ended December 31, 2011.

Service revenue consists of fixed monthly recurring charges, variable usage charges and miscellaneous fees such as activation fees, directory assistance, roaming, equipment protection, late payment and early termination charges and certain regulatory related fees, net of service credits. The ability of our Wireless segment to generate service revenues is primarily a function of: revenue generated from each subscriber, which in turn is a function of the types and amount of services utilized by each subscriber and the rates charged for those services; andthe number of subscribers that we serve, which in turn is a function of our ability to retain existing and acquire new subscribers.Retail comprises those subscribers to whom Sprint directly provides wireless services, whether those services are provided on a postpaid or a prepaid basis. Retail service revenue increased $1.5 billion, or 6%, in 2011 as compared to 2010 and increased $391 million, or 2% in 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase in retail service revenue in 2011 as compared to 2010 reflects an increase in postpaid service revenue related to our $10 premium data add on charge required for all smartphones and greater popularity of unlimited and bundled plans, combined with other fee increases including an increase in our handset protection plan. The increase was also driven by attracting more subscribers to our Boost and Virgin Mobile prepaid brands who are choosing higher rate plans to take advantage of international offerings as well as the increased availability of smartphones and increased subscribers from new market launches for our Assurance Wireless brand. The majority of the increase in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily driven by attracting subscribers to the Companys National Boost Monthly Unlimited prepaid plan in addition to service revenue related to the subscribers acquired through our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions of Virgin Mobile and iPCS. This increase in retail service revenue was partially offset by a decrease in postpaid service revenue driven by a reduction in the Companys average number of postpaid subscribers of approximately 1.4 million, or 4%, in 2010 as compared to 2009. Wholesale and affiliates are those subscribers who are served through 3G MVNO and affiliate relationships and other arrangements through which wireless services are sold by Sprint to other companies that resell those services to subscribers. Wholesale, affiliate and other revenues increased $44 million, or 20%, for 2011 as compared to 2010, and decreased $329 million, or 60%, for 2010 as compared to 2009. The majority of the increase in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily a result of growth in our 3G MVNO relationships. Specifically, growth in subscribers on the Lifeline program offered through our MVNOs reselling prepaid services, which is similar to our Assurance Wireless offering, contributed to revenue growth. The majority of the decrease in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to the transfer of 5.4 million subscribers from wholesale and affiliates into postpaid and prepaid classifications as a result of the fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions of Virgin Mobile and iPCS. The remaining decline in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to losses from two of our large MVNOs throughout 2009 in addition to lower revenues received from services provided through our machine to machine initiative. Approximately 29% of our wholesale and affiliate subscribers represent a growing number of connected devices. These devices generate revenue from usage which varies depending on the solution being utilized. Average revenue per connected device is generally significantly lower than revenue from other wholesale and affiliate subscribers; however, the cost to service these customers is also lower resulting in a higher profit margin as a percent of revenue.35Table of ContentsAverage Monthly Service Revenue per Subscriber and Subscriber Trends The table below summarizes average number of retail subscribers and ARPU for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Additional information about the number of subscribers, net additions to subscribers, ARPU, and average rates of monthly postpaid and prepaid subscriber churn for each quarter since the first quarter 2009 may be found in the tables on the following pages. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (subscribers in thousands)Average postpaid subscribers 32,935 33,249 34,640Average prepaid subscribers 13,672 11,272 5,313Average retail subscribers46,607 44,521 39,953ARPU(1): Postpaid$57.27 $54.94 $55.83Prepaid$27.40 $27.76 $32.64Average retail$48.51 $48.06 $52.74 (1)ARPU is calculated by dividing service revenue by the sum of the average number of subscribers in the applicable service category. Changes in average monthly service revenue reflect subscribers for either the postpaid or prepaid service category who change rate plans, the level of voice and data usage, the amount of service credits which are offered to subscribers, plus the net effect of average monthly revenue generated by new subscribers and deactivating subscribers. Postpaid ARPU for 2011 increased as compared to 2010 primarily due to increased revenues from the $10 premium data add on charges for all smartphones and fee increases in our handset protection plan. Postpaid ARPU for 2010 declined slightly as compared to 2009 due to declines in overage revenues resulting from the increased popularity of fixed rate bundled plans including the Any Mobile AnytimeSM feature. Prepaid ARPU for 2011 declined slightly compared to 2010 primarily as a result of net additions of our Assurance Wireless brand whose subscribers carry a lower ARPU, partially offset by an increase in ARPU for the remaining prepaid brands as subscribers are choosing higher priced plans to take advantage of international offerings and the increased availability of smartphones. Prepaid ARPU decreased during 2010 as compared to 2009 due to prepaid subscribers acquired in our fourth quarter 2009 business combination of Virgin Mobile as well as net subscriber additions under our Assurance Wireless brand launched in early 2010, which carry a lower average revenue per subscriber compared to Sprints other prepaid subscribers. Average retail ARPU increased slightly for 2011 compared to 2010 primarily as a result of the increased postpaid ARPU which was partially offset by an increased weighting of average prepaid subscribers to total subscribers which carry a lower ARPU. The lower prepaid ARPU and the increased weighting of average prepaid subscribers to total subscribers resulted in a decline in our average retail ARPU for 2010 compared to 2009.36Table of ContentsThe following table shows (a) net additions (losses) of wireless subscribers and (b) our total subscribers as of the end of each quarterly period for the past twelve quarters.

For postpaid accounts comprising multiple subscribers, such as family plans and enterprise accounts, net deactivations are defined as deactivations in excess of customer activations in a particular account within 30 days. Postpaid and prepaid churn consist of both voluntary churn, where the subscriber makes his or her own determination to cease being a customer, and involuntary churn, where the customers service is terminated due to a lack of payment or other reasons. 38Table of ContentsRetail Postpaid SubscribersWe lost 98,000 net postpaid subscribers during 2011 as compared to losing 855,000 and 3.5 million net postpaid subscribers during 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net postpaid subscriber losses improved by 757,000, or 89%, during 2011 as compared to 2010 and 2.7 million, or 76% during 2010 as compared to 2009. Of the 33 million total subscribers included in postpaid, approximately 2% represent connected devices. Net additions of connected devices were 82,000 during 2011, as compared to net additions of 24,000 and 43,000 during the same periods in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our improvement in net postpaid subscriber losses can be attributed to our improvements in retail postpaid gross additions and lower postpaid churn resulting from simplified and value driven bundled offers, a more competitive device line up, as well as our improvements in overall customer experience and customer care satisfaction. We plan to migrate Nextel platform push to talk subscribers by providing competitive offerings on the Sprint platform, which includes future offerings on our multi mode network, such as Sprint Direct Connect. Retail Prepaid SubscribersWe added approximately 2.5 million net prepaid subscribers during 2011 as compared to adding 1.6 million and 2.6 million net prepaid subscribers in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net prepaid subscriber additions improved by 874,000, or 53%, during 2011 as compared to 2010 and declined 914,000, or 36%, during 2010 as compared to 2009. Our improvement in net prepaid subscriber additions for 2011 as compared to 2010 were driven by net additions from the Assurance Wireless brand primarily as a result of new market launches and increased advertising and promotions. Our net prepaid subscriber additions in 2010 were principally driven by net additions from the Assurance Wireless and Boost Mobile brands, partially offset by net losses associated with the Virgin Mobile brand including a transfer of 49,000 subscribers from prepaid to wholesale and affiliates as a result of a sale and transfer of customers to an affiliate. The Company expects to continue the trend of prepaid subscriber losses under the Nextel platform as we focus efforts to retain and attract such subscribers to our offerings on the Sprint platform. Prepaid subscribers are generally deactivated between 60 days and up to 150 days from the date of activation or replenishment; however, prior to account deactivation, targeted retention programs can be offered to qualifying subscribers to maintain ongoing service by providing up to an additional 150 days to make a replenishment. Subscribers targeted through these retention offers are not included in the calculation of churn until their retention offer expires without a replenishment to their account. As a result, end of period prepaid subscribers include subscribers engaged in these retention programs. Retention offers to these targeted subscribers declined as a percentage of our total prepaid subscriber base during 2011 as compared to 2010.Wholesale and Affiliate SubscribersWholesale and affiliate subscribers represent customers that are served on our networks through companies that resell our wireless services to their subscribers, customers residing in affiliate territories and connected devices that utilize our network. During 2011, wholesale and affiliate subscriber net additions were 2.7 million resulting in approximately 7.2 million wholesale and affiliate subscribers as of December 31, 2011, compared to approximately 4.5 million and 3.5 million wholesale and affiliate subscribers as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Wholesale and affiliate subscriber net additions improved by 1.7 million, or 171%, during 2011 as compared to 2010 and 1.1 million, or 820%, during 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase in the wholesale subscriber base during 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily driven by net additions from the Lifeline program offered through our MVNOs reselling prepaid services. The increase in the wholesale subscriber base during 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to subscriber additions in other MVNO relationships. Of the 7.2 million total subscribers included in wholesale and affiliates, approximately 29% represent connected devices. Net additions of connected devices were 217,000 during 2011, as compared to net additions of 152,000 and 846,000 during 2010 and 2009, respectively. 39Table of ContentsCost of Services Cost of services consists primarily of:costs to operate and maintain our networks, including direct switch and cell site costs, such as rent, utilities, maintenance, labor costs associated with network employees, and spectrum frequency leasing costs; fixed and variable interconnection costs, the fixed component of which consists of monthly flat rate fees for facilities leased from local exchange carriers based on the number of cell sites and switches in service in a particular period and the related equipment installed at each site, and the variable component of which generally consists of per minute use fees charged by wireline providers for calls terminating on their networks, which fluctuate in relation to the level and duration of those terminating calls;long distance costs paid to the Wireline segment;costs to service and repair devices;regulatory fees;roaming fees paid to other carriers; and fixed and variable costs relating to payments to third parties for the use of their proprietary data applications, such as messaging, music, TV, and navigation services by our subscribers.Cost of services increased $619 million, or 7%, in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily reflecting increased roaming due to higher 4G MVNO data usage. In addition, higher service and repair costs were incurred driven by the increase in the cost per unit of new and used devices due to the growth in smartphone popularity. We are also in the process of renegotiating cell site leases to enable further flexibility in connection with Network Vision, including spectrum hosting services, which has resulted in a net increase to rent expense and is expected to continue until such time we can successfully deploy Network Vision and benefit from an overall reduction in our total portfolio of tower leases. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in long distance network costs as a result of lower market rates and a decline in payments to third party vendors for use of their proprietary data applications and premium services as a result of contract renegotiations providing more favorable rates. Cost of services decreased $96 million, or 1%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily reflecting a decline in service and repair costs by focusing on device repairs and refurbishment rather than utilizing new devices, a decline in long distance network costs as a result of lower market rates, as well as a decline in payments to third party vendors providing premium services as a result of changing from usage based payments to flat rates. This decline was partially offset by increased roaming due to higher data usage and an increase in license fees as a result of the continued growth in smartphone devices, which carry higher fees.Equipment Net Subsidy We recognize equipment revenue and corresponding costs of devices when title of the device passes to the dealer or end user subscriber. Our marketing plans assume that devices typically will be sold at prices below cost, which is consistent with industry practice, as subscriber retention efforts often include providing incentives to subscribers such as offering new devices at discounted prices. We reduce equipment revenue for these discounts offered directly to the subscriber, and for certain payments to third party dealers to reimburse the dealer for point of sale discounts that are offered to the end user subscriber primarily associated with obtaining a service plan. Additionally, the cost of devices is reduced by any rebates that are earned from the supplier. Cost of products (primarily devices and accessories) also include order fulfillment related expenses and write downs of device and related accessory inventory for shrinkage and obsolescence. Equipment cost in excess of the revenue generated from equipment sales is referred to in the industry as equipment net subsidy. Equipment revenue increased $208 million, or 8%, in 2011 compared to 2010 and cost of products increased $1.1 billion, or 16%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in both equipment revenue and cost of products is primarily due to a higher average sales price and cost per device sold for both postpaid and prepaid devices in addition to an overall increase in the number of prepaid devices sold, partially offset by a decline in the number of postpaid devices sold. Equipment revenue increased $749 million, or 38%, in 2010 compared to 2009 and cost of products increased $1.4 billion, or 26%, in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in the number of postpaid devices sold with a greater mix of devices that have a higher average sales price and cost, as well as an increase in the number of prepaid devices sold. 40Table of ContentsSelling, General and Administrative Expense Sales and marketing costs primarily consist of customer acquisition costs, including commissions paid to our indirect dealers, third party distributors and retail sales force for new device activations and upgrades, residual payments to our indirect dealers, payments made to OEMs for direct source equipment, payroll and facilities costs associated with our retail sales force, marketing employees, advertising, media programs and sponsorships, including costs related to branding. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for billing, customer care and information technology operations, bad debt expense and administrative support activities, including collections, legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications, strategic planning, and technology and product development. Sales and marketing expense was $5.1 billion, an increase of $246 million, or 5%, in 2011 from 2010 and $4.8 billion, an increase of $322 million, or 7%, in 2010 from 2009. The increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the prior period is primarily due to reimbursements for point of sale discounts for iPhones, which are directly sourced by distributors from Apple and accounted for as sales expense, as well as the additional costs associated with our increase in subscriber gross additions, slightly offset by a decrease in media spend. Point of sale discounts are included in the determination of equipment net subsidy when we purchase and resell devices. The increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the prior period is primarily due to the additional costs associated with our increase in subscriber gross additions combined with incremental costs associated with our business combinations in the fourth quarter 2009, offset by a decline in marketing expenditures related to our cost cutting initiatives. General and administrative costs were $4.0 billion, an insignificant increase of $11 million in 2011 from 2010 and $4.0 billion, a decrease of $203 million, or 5%, in 2010 from 2009. The slight increase in general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2011 reflects an increase in bad debt expense partially offset by a reduction in customer care costs as well as reductions in prepaid integration costs incurred in 2010 associated with our business acquisitions. The decline in general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2010 reflects a reduction in customer care costs and minor continued effects of workforce reductions and cost cutting initiatives announced in 2009 offset by increases as a result of the fourth quarter 2009 business acquisitions of Virgin Mobile and iPCS in addition to an increase in bad debt expense. Customer care costs decreased $120 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 and $87 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. The improvement in customer care costs is largely attributable to customer care quality initiatives and price plan simplification that have resulted in a reduction in calls per subscriber, which allowed for further optimization of call center resources. Bad debt expense was $552 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 representing a $129 million increase, as compared to bad debt expense of $423 million in 2010. The increase in bad debt expense primarily reflects an increase in the aging of accounts receivable outstanding greater than 60 days combined with an increase in the average write off per account. For the year ended December 31, 2010, bad debt expense increased $31 million as compared to bad debt expense of $392 million in 2009. The increase in bad debt expense primarily reflects 2009 reductions in allowances for bad debt due to increased rates of recovery. We reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly. Changes in our allowance for doubtful accounts are largely attributable to the analysis of historical collection experience and changes, if any, in credit policies established for subscribers. Our mix of prime postpaid subscribers to total postpaid subscribers was 82% as of December 31, 2011 as compared to 84% as of December 31, 2010. Segment Earnings Wireline Wireline segment earnings are primarily a function of wireline service revenue, network and interconnection costs, and other Wireline segment operating expenses. Network costs primarily represent special access costs and interconnection costs, which generally consist of domestic and international per minute usage fees paid to other carriers. The remaining costs associated with operating the Wireline segment include the costs to operate our customer care and billing organizations in addition to administrative support. Wireline service revenue and variable network and interconnection costs fluctuate with the changes in our customer base and their related usage, but some cost elements do not fluctuate in the short term with the changes in our customer usage. Our wireline services provided to our Wireless segment are generally accounted for based on market rates, which we believe approximate fair value. The Company generally re establishes these rates at the beginning of each fiscal year. Over the past several years, there has been an industry wide trend of lower rates due to increased competition from other wireline and wireless communications companies as well as cable and Internet service providers. For 2012, we expect wireline segment earnings to decline by approximately $180 to $220 million to reflect changes in 41Table of Contentsmarket prices for services provided by our Wireline segment to our Wireless segment. This decline in wireline segment earnings related to intercompany pricing will not affect our consolidated results of operations as our Wireless segment will benefit from an equivalent reduction in cost of service. The following table provides an overview of the results of operations of our Wireline segment for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Year Ended December 31,Wireline Earnings2011 2010 2009 (in millions)Voice$1,915 $2,249 $2,563Data460 519 662Internet1,878 2,175 2,293Other73 97 111Total net service revenue4,326 5,040 5,629Cost of services and products(3,005) (3,319) (3,663)Service gross margin1,321 1,721 1,966Service gross margin percentage31% 34% 35%Selling, general and administrative expense(521) (631) (745)Wireline segment earnings$800 $1,090 $1,221Wireline Revenue Voice Revenues Voice revenues decreased $334 million, or 15%, in 2011 as compared to 2010 and $314 million, or 12%, in 2010 as compared to 2009. The 2011 decrease was primarily driven by overall price declines of which $115 million was related to the decline in prices for the sale of services to our Wireless segment as well as volume declines due to customer churn. The 2010 decrease was primarily driven by volume declines due to customer churn as well as overall price declines. Voice revenues generated from the sale of services to our Wireless segment represented 34% of total voice revenues in 2011 as compared to 33% in 2010 and 31% in 2009. Data Revenues Data revenues reflect sales of data services, including ATM, frame relay and managed network services. Data revenues decreased $59 million, or 11%, in 2011 as compared to 2010 and $143 million, or 22%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 as a result of customer churn driven by the focus to no longer provide frame relay and ATM services in each of those periods. Data revenues generated from the provision of services to the Wireless segment represented 35% of total data revenue in 2011 as compared to 27% in 2010 and 19% in 2009. Internet Revenues Internet revenues reflect sales of IP based data services, including MPLS, VoIP and SIP. Internet revenues decreased $297 million, or 14%, in 2011 from 2010 and $118 million, or 5%, in 2010 from 2009. Certain MSOs have decided to in source their digital voice products resulting in a $181 million decrease in 2011 as compared to 2010. In addition, Internet revenues generated from the sale of services to our Wireless segment declined by $94 million due to a decline in prices. The 2010 decrease was due to a decline in new IP customers with lower market rates as a result of increased competition. Internet revenues generated from the provision of services to the Wireless segment represented 8% of total Internet revenues in 2011 as compared to 10% in 2010 and 11% in 2009. Other Revenues Other revenues, which primarily consist of sales of customer premises equipment, decreased $24 million, or 25% in 2011 as compared to 2010 and $14 million, or 13%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 as a result of fewer projects in 2011 and 2010. 42Table of ContentsCosts of Services and Products Costs of services and products include access costs paid to local phone companies, other domestic service providers and foreign phone companies to complete calls made by our domestic subscribers, costs to operate and maintain our networks, and costs of equipment. Costs of services and products decreased $314 million, or 9%, in 2011 from 2010 and $344 million, or 9%, in 2010 from 2009. The decrease in 2011 and 2010 was primarily due to lower access expense as a result of savings initiatives and migration from data to IP based technologies in addition to declining voice volumes. Service gross margin percentage decreased from 35% in 2009 to 34% in 2010 and further decreased to 31% in 2011 as a result of a decrease in net service revenue partially offset by a decrease in costs of services and products.Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $110 million, or 17%, in 2011 as compared to 2010 and $114 million, or 15% in 2010 as compared 2009. The decrease in 2011 was primarily due to a reduction in shared administrative and employee related costs required to support the Wireline segment as a result of the decline in revenue. The decrease in 2010 was primarily due to a reduction in employee headcount and a decline in the use of outside services and maintenance as part of our cost cutting initiatives. Total selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net services revenue was 12% in 2011 and 13% in 2010 and 2009. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$3,691 $4,815 $4,891Net cash used in investing activities(3,443) (2,556) (3,844)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities26 (905) (919)Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $3.7 billion in 2011 decreased $1.1 billion from the same period in 2010. The decrease resulted from an increase in vendor and labor related payments of $2.6 billion, which primarily related to an increase in the average cost of postpaid and prepaid devices sold and related increases in inventory, increased roaming due to higher 3G and 4G data usage, as well as $136 million in pension contribution payments. This was offset by $1.2 billion of increased cash received from customers primarily due to increases in total subscriber net additions and $310 million received for spectrum hosting. In addition, cash paid for interest decreased by $430 million, of which, $395 million was associated with interest capitalization as a result of Network Vision and was reflected as an investing activity. Net cash provided by operating activities of $4.8 billion in 2010 decreased by $76 million from 2009, primarily due to a $196 million decrease in cash received from our subscribers resulting from a decline in our postpaid subscriber customer base, an increase of $217 million in cash paid to our suppliers and employees, and an increase of $36 million in cash paid for interest. These were partially offset by an increase of $170 million in cash received for income tax refunds. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2009 also includes a cash payment of $200 million resulting from a contribution to the Company pension plan. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for 2011 increased by $887 million from 2010, due to increases of $480 million in purchases of short term investments and $1.2 billion in capital expenditures. Increases in capital expenditures are related to the addition of data capacity to our wireless networks and Network Vision and also include $395 million due to the recognition of capitalized interest on qualifying activities associated with Network Vision primarily related to the carrying value of spectrum licenses not yet placed in service. These increases in use of cash were offset by increases of $825 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments and a decrease of $201 million in expenditures related to FCC licenses as determined by specific operations requirements of the Report and Order. We also received $135 million in reimbursements from the mobile satellite service (MSS) entrants for their pro rata portion of our costs of clearing a portion of the 1.9 GHz spectrum. In 43Table of Contentsaddition, during the fourth quarter 2011, Sprint invested an additional $331 million in Clearwire as a result of an amendment to our agreements and Clearwires successful offering of additional Class A shares to the market.Net cash used in investing activities for 2010 decreased by $1.3 billion from 2009, due to a decrease of $300 million in purchases of short term investments and a decrease of $132 million in expenditures related to FCC licenses as determined by specific operation requirements of the Report and Order. These decreases were partially offset by reduced proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments of $418 million and increased capital expenditures of $332 million to add coverage and capacity to our wireless networks. Sprint also increased its investment in Clearwire by $1.1 billion and acquired iPCS and Virgin Mobile for $560 million in 2009, which resulted in the remaining decline in 2010 as compared to 2009. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $26 million during 2011. During 2011, the Company repaid certain debt obligations, including $1.65 billion of Sprint Capital Corporation 7.625% senior notes, the early redemption of $2.0 billion of Sprint Capital Corporation 8.375% senior notes and repayment of $250 million of the $750 million Export Development Canada (EDC) Facility. The reductions in debt obligations were offset by proceeds from issuance of $1.0 billion of 11.5% senior notes due 2021 and $3.0 billion of 9% guaranteed notes due 2018 in a private placement in November 2011. We also paid $86 million for debt financing costs associated with our November 2011 debt issuances and fourth quarter credit facility amendments.Net cash used in financing activities was $905 million during 2010. Activities in 2010 included a $750 million debt payment in June 2010 and a $51 million payment for debt financing costs associated with our new revolving credit facility. In addition, in the fourth quarter 2010, we exercised an option to terminate our relationship with a variable interest entity, which resulted in the repayment of financing, capital lease and other obligations of $105 million.Net cash used in financing activities was $919 million during 2009. Activities in 2009 include debt repayments of $600 million of senior notes in May 2009, the early redemption of $607 million of our convertible senior notes in September 2009, and a $1.0 billion payment on our revolving bank credit facility in November 2009 offset by the issuance of $1.3 billion of senior notes in August 2009.We received $18 million, $8 million and $4 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in proceeds from common share issuances, primarily resulting from exercises of employee options.Liquidity As of December 31, 2011, our liquidity, including cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility was $6.7 billion. Our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2011 compared to $5.5 billion as of December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2011, $1.1 billion in letters of credit were outstanding under our $2.2 billion revolving bank credit facility, including the letter of credit required by the Report and Order to reconfigure the 800 MHz band. As a result of the outstanding letters of credit, which directly reduce the availability of the revolving bank credit facility, we had $1.1 billion of borrowing capacity available under our revolving bank credit facility as of December 31, 2011. On January 31, 2011, $1.65 billion of Sprint Capital Corporation 7.625% senior notes were repaid upon maturity. Also in January 2011, we amended $500 million of our $750 million EDC loan to extend the maturity date from 2012 to 2015. In October 2011, we amended the terms of our revolving credit facility to modify certain financial covenants and increase in the capacity by $150 million to $2.2 billion. On November 23, 2011, we paid $250 million plus accrued and unpaid interest of the EDC loan due 2012. In addition, the EDC loan agreement was amended in December 2011 to provide for similar covenant terms to those of the amended revolving bank credit facility. On December 29, 2011, we redeemed all of our outstanding $2.0 billion Sprint Capital Corporation 8.375% senior notes due March 2012 for principal plus accrued and unpaid interest in addition to a $33 million loss recognized as a result of the early retirement. In January 2012, we received a $150 million note receivable with a stated interest rate of 11.5% from Clearwire as a result of the additional investment provided to Clearwire through our amended agreement in the fourth quarter 2011 that matures in two installments of $75 million plus accrued interest in January 2013 and in January 2014.In September 2011, we entered into a four year commitment with Apple, Inc. to purchase a minimum number of smartphones, which on average, are expected to carry a higher subsidy per unit than other smartphones we sell. Our minimum commitment under this arrangement is approximately $15.5 billion; however, we expect our actual purchases will exceed this amount. This will result in an expected increase in cash outflow and reduction in 44Table of Contentsoperating income in the earlier years of the contract until such time as we may recover the acquisition costs through subscriber revenue.Additionally, in October 2011, we announced our intention to accelerate the timeline associated with Network Vision, our network modernization plan. In addition to Network Vision, we are currently experiencing rapid growth in data usage which requires additional capital for data capacity to meet our customers needs and to maintain customer satisfaction. Our accelerated timeline coupled with our capital needs to maintain and operate our existing infrastructure are expected to require approximately $10 billion in total capital expenditures over the two year period ending December 31, 2013. In addition to our expectation of increased capital expenditures, we also expect network operating expenditures to increase during the deployment period. To meet our short and long term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Our existing liquidity balance and cash generated from operating activities is our primary source of funding. In addition to cash flows from operating activities, we rely on the borrowing capacity available under our credit facility, the ability to issue debt and equity securities, and other forms of financing to support our short and long term liquidity requirements. In November 2011, Sprint Nextel Corporation issued $1.0 billion of 11.5% senior notes due 2021 and $3.0 billion of 9% guaranteed notes due 2018. We believe these issuances, in addition to our existing available liquidity and cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements through at least 2012 including debt service requirements, and other significant future contractual obligations. To maintain an adequate amount of available liquidity and execute according to the timeline of our current business plan, which includes Network Vision, subscriber growth and the expected achievement of a cost structure intended to achieve more competitive margins, we expect we will need to raise additional funds from external resources of approximately $1.0 billion to $3.0 billion through 2013, dependent, in part, on our ability to maintain adequate cash balances and the ongoing availability of our existing unutilized borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities. If we are unable to fund our remaining capital needs from external resources on terms acceptable to us, we would need to modify our existing business plan, which could adversely affect our expectation of long term benefits to results from operations and cash flows from operations. In determining our expectation of future funding needs in the next 12 months and beyond, we have considered: projected revenues and expenses relating to our operations; anticipated levels and timing of capital expenditures, including the capacity and upgrading of our networks and the deployment of new technologies in our networks, and FCC license acquisitions; anticipated payments under the Report and Order, as supplemented; any additional contributions we may make to our pension plan; scheduled debt service requirements; additional investments, if any, we may choose to make in Clearwire; andother future contractual obligations and general corporate expenditures.As of December 31, 2011, we had working capital of $3.8 billion compared to $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2010. The increase in working capital is primarily due to the net cash proceeds of approximately $3.9 billion from the issuance of notes, increases in device and accessory inventory, and decreases in the current portion of long term debt related to the repayment of $1.65 billion of Sprint Capital Corporation 7.625% senior notes due January 2011. The remaining change is primarily related to other activity in current assets during 2011.Capital ResourcesOur ability to fund our capital needs from external sources is ultimately affected by the overall capacity and terms of the banking and securities markets, as well as our performance and our credit ratings. Given our recent financial performance as well as the volatility in these markets, we continue to monitor them closely and to take steps to maintain financial flexibility and a reasonable cost of capital.As of December 31, 2011, Moodys Investor Service, Standard & Poors Ratings Services, and Fitch Ratings had assigned the following credit ratings to certain of our outstanding obligations: 45Table of Contents Rating Rating Agency Issuer Rating Unsecured Notes Guaranteed Notes CreditFacility OutlookMoodys B1 B3 Ba3 Ba1 Review for DowngradeStandard and Poors B+ B+ BB NegativeFitch B+ B+ BB BB NegativeDowngrades of our current ratings do not accelerate scheduled principal payments of our existing debt. However, downgrades may cause us to incur higher interest costs on our credit facilities and future borrowings, if any, and could negatively impact our access to the public capital markets.The terms and conditions of our revolving bank credit facility require the ratio of total indebtedness to trailing four quarters earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other non recurring items, as defined by the credit facility (adjusted EBITDA), to be no more than 4.5 to 1.0. In October 2011, our credit facility was amended to prospectively redefine adjusted EBITDA to exclude costs comprising equipment net subsidy, as defined by the amended agreement, to the extent such costs exceed $1.1 billion in any of the six consecutive fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2013. The amount added back related to this exclusion cannot exceed $1.75 billion in any four consecutive fiscal quarters and is limited to $2.7 billion in the aggregate for the six consecutive fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2013. After March 31, 2012, the ratio will be reduced to 4.25 to 1.0, and further reduced to 4.0 to 1.0 after December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the ratio was 3.7 to 1.0. Under this revolving bank credit facility, we are currently restricted from paying cash dividends because our ratio of total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA exceeds 2.5 to 1.0. The terms of our amended revolving bank credit facility provide for an interest rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin of between 2.75% to 4.0% beginning in October 2011. Certain of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the revolving bank credit facility. A default under our borrowings could trigger defaults under our other debt obligations, which in turn could result in the maturities being accelerated. Certain indentures that govern our outstanding notes also require compliance with various covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness and liens by the Company and its subsidiaries, as defined by the terms of the indentures. Certain of our indentures also contain covenants that limit the Companys ability to sell all or substantially all of its assets or to merge or consolidate with or into other companies.We expect to remain in compliance with our covenants through at least the end of 2012, although there can be no assurance that we will do so. Although we expect to improve our subscriber results, and execute on our Network Vision plans, including the decommissioning of the Nextel platform, if we do not meet our plan, depending on the severity of any difference in actual results versus what we currently anticipate, it is possible that we would not remain in compliance with our covenants or be able to meet our debt service obligations, which could result in acceleration of our indebtedness. If such unforeseen events occur, we may engage with our lenders to obtain appropriate waivers or amendments of our credit facilities or refinance borrowings, although there is no assurance we would be successful in any of these actions. CURRENT BUSINESS OUTLOOK We endeavor to both retain our existing and add new wireless subscribers in order to reverse the net loss in postpaid wireless subscribers that we have experienced. We expect to improve our subscriber trends by continuing to improve the customer experience by enhancing our network, providing diversity of devices, and through offers which provide value, simplicity and productivity. Given the current economic environment, the difficulties the economic uncertainties create in forecasting, as well as the inherent uncertainties in predicting future customer behavior, we are unable to forecast with assurance the net retail postpaid subscriber results we will experience during 2012 or thereafter. However, the Company expects 2012 Consolidated segment earnings to be between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion, including the estimated impact of the iPhone and the effects of Network Vision. We expect total net service revenue growth of approximately 4% to 6%. The Company also expects full year capital expenditures in 2012, excluding capitalized interest, to be approximately $6 billion. The above discussion is subject to the risks and other cautionary and qualifying factors set forth under Forward Looking Statements and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in this report. 46Table of ContentsFUTURE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments as of December 31, 2011. Future events, including additional purchases of our securities and refinancing of those securities, could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts. See Forward Looking Statements.

(3)Includes future lease costs related to cell and switch sites, real estate, network equipment and office space. (4)Includes service, spectrum, network capacity and other executory contracts. Excludes blanket purchase orders in the amount of $24 million. See below for further discussion. Purchase orders and other commitments include minimum purchases we commit to purchase from suppliers over time and or the unconditional purchase obligations where we guarantee to make a minimum payment to suppliers for goods and services regardless of whether we take delivery. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but generally represent only our estimate of those items for which we are committed. Our estimates are based on assumptions about the variable components of the contracts such as hours contracted, number of subscribers, pricing, and other factors. In addition, we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and create an obligation to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the delivery of functioning software or products. Because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements, no such amounts have been included in the table above. The table above also excludes approximately $24 million of blanket purchase order amounts since their agreement terms are not specified. No time frame is set for these purchase orders and they are not legally binding. As a result, they are not firm commitments. Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $225 million as of December 31, 2011. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the timing of the resolution of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular year(s) in the table. The table above does not include remaining costs to be paid in connection with the fulfillment of our obligations under the Report and Order. The Report and Order requires us to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury at the conclusion of the band reconfiguration process to the extent that the value of the 1.9 GHz spectrum we received exceeds the total of the value of licenses for spectrum in the 700 MHz and 800 MHz bands that we surrendered under the decision plus the actual costs, or qualifying costs, that we incur to retune incumbents and our own facilities. From the inception of the program through December 31, 2011, we have incurred approximately $3.1 billion of costs directly attributable to the spectrum reconfiguration program. This amount does not include any of our internal network costs that we have preliminarily allocated to the reconfiguration program for capacity sites and modifications for which we may request credit under the reconfiguration program. We estimate, based on our experience to date with the reconfiguration program and on information currently available, that our total direct costs attributable to complete the spectrum reconfigurations will range between $3.6 and $3.7 billion. Accordingly, we believe that it is unlikely that we will be required to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury. 47Table of ContentsOFF BALANCE SHEET FINANCING We do not participate in, or secure, financings for any unconsolidated, special purpose entities. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Sprint applies those accounting policies that management believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Sprints more critical accounting policies include those related to the basis of presentation, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation and recoverability of our equity method investment in Clearwire, valuation and recoverability of long lived assets, and evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived assets for impairment. Inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management. Management regularly updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment. These critical accounting policies have been discussed with Sprints Board of Directors. Sprints significant accounting policies are summarized in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Sprint and its consolidated subsidiaries. Investments where Sprint maintains majority ownership, but lacks full decision making ability over all major issues, are accounted for using the equity method. Governance for Sprints major unconsolidated investment, Clearwire, is based on Clearwire board representation for which Sprint does not have a majority vote. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from failure of our subscribers to make required payments. Our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts considers a number of factors, including collection experience, aging of the accounts receivable portfolios, credit quality of the subscriber base, and other qualitative considerations. To the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends, the required allowance amounts could differ from our estimate. A 10% change in the amount estimated to be uncollectible would result in a corresponding change in bad debt expense of approximately $21 million for the Wireless segment and $1 million for the Wireline segment. Valuation and Recoverability of our Equity Method Investment in Clearwire We assess our equity method investment for other than temporary impairment when indicators such as decline in quoted prices in active markets indicate a value below the carrying value of our investment. This evaluation requires significant judgment regarding, but not limited to, the severity and duration of decline in market prices; the ability and intent to hold the securities until recovery; financial condition, liquidity, and near term prospects of the investee, specific events, and other factors. At each financial reporting measurement date, we evaluate the excess, if any, of Sprints carrying value over the estimated fair value of our investment in Clearwire to determine if such excess, an implied unrealized loss, is other than temporary. Our evaluation considers, among other things, Clearwires market capitalization, volatility associated with Clearwires common stock, and the duration of a decline in Clearwires average trading stock price below Sprints carrying value. Our evaluation also considers tax benefits associated with our Class B non voting common interests in Clearwire Communications LLC, governance rights, our expectation of the duration of our ongoing relationship, as well as other factors. Based on our evaluation as of December 31, 2011, we recognized a non cash impairment of our investment in Clearwire of $135 million in the fourth quarter 2011. The carrying value of our equity method investment in Clearwire as of December 31, 2011 totaled approximately $1.7 billion.Valuation and Recoverability of Long lived Assets Long lived assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization. Changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets, as well as changes in economic or industry factors or in our business or prospects, may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change. 48Table of ContentsProperty, plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated economic useful lives. Certain network assets are depreciated using the group life method. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. When these factors indicate that an assets useful life is different from the previous assessment, we depreciate the remaining book values prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. Depreciation rates for assets using the group life method are revised periodically as required under this method. Changes made as a result of depreciable life studies and rate changes generally do not have a material effect on depreciation expense. Long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Long lived asset groups were determined based upon certain factors including assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of our assets, a loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the assets. Impairment analyses, when performed, are based on our current business and technology strategy, views of growth rates for our business, anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability. Our estimate of undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of these assets by more than 10%. If we continue to have operational challenges, including retaining and attracting subscribers, future cash flows of the Company may not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of our wireless asset group, and we could record asset impairments that are material to Sprints consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In addition to the analysis described above, certain assets that have not yet been deployed in the business, including network equipment, cell site development costs and software in development, are periodically assessed to determine recoverability. Network equipment and cell site development costs are expensed whenever events or changes in circumstances cause the Company to conclude the assets are no longer needed to meet managements strategic network plans and will not be deployed. Software development costs are expensed when it is no longer probable that the software project will be deployed. Network equipment that has been removed from the network is also periodically assessed to determine recoverability. In connection with Network Vision, including the decommissioning of the Nextel platform, management may conclude in future periods that certain equipment will never be either deployed or redeployed, in which case non cash charges that could be material to our consolidated financial statements would be recognized. Refer to Results of Operations for additional information on asset impairments. Evaluation of Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price paid over the fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. Sprint evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed estimated fair value. Our analysis includes a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill applies to the carrying value, including goodwill, of that reporting unit. We regularly assess whether any indicators of impairment exist, which requires a significant amount of judgment. Such indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization; a decline in our expected future cash flows; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and or slower growth rates, among others. Any adverse change in these factors could result in an impairment up to the carrying value of our goodwill, which was $359 million as of December 31, 2011. The Company recognizes that our market capitalization, the product of our traded stock price, and shares outstanding, is subject to volatility and, during certain periods, has been below our shareholders equity book value. Accordingly we monitor changes in our market capitalization between annual impairment tests to determine whether declines, if any, should necessitate an interim review of goodwill for impairment. We consider a decline in our market capitalization that corresponds to an overall deterioration in stock market conditions to be less of an indicator of goodwill impairment than a unilateral decline in our market capitalization, which could result from adverse changes in our underlying operating performance, cash flows, financial condition and or liquidity. In the event that our market capitalization does decline below its book value, we consider the length and severity of the decline and 49Table of Contentsthe reasons for the decline when assessing whether a potential goodwill impairment exists. We believe that short term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect underlying aggregate fair value of our segments, which are our reporting units. We also believe that the market price of our stock may not be representative of the fair value of our overall business since it does not include a control premium that a market participant may be willing to pay for the ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that could be derived from control of the Company. However, if a decline in our market capitalization below book value persists for an extended period of time, we would likely consider the decline to be indicative of a decline in the estimated fair value at the reporting unit level.Differences in the Companys actual future cash flows, operating results, growth rates, capital expenditures, cost of capital and discount rates as compared to the estimates utilized for the purpose of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit, as well as a decline in the Companys stock price and related market capitalization, could affect the results of our annual goodwill assessment and, accordingly, potentially lead to a future goodwill impairment.The determination of the estimated fair value of the wireless reporting unit requires significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, transactions within the wireless industry and related control premiums, discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) and capital expenditures forecasts. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. The merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit are evaluated for reasonableness. A decline in the estimated fair value of our wireless reporting unit of 10% would not result in an impairment of our goodwill.FCC licenses and our Sprint and Boost Mobile trademarks have been identified as indefinite lived intangible assets, in addition to goodwill, after considering the expected use of the assets, the regulatory and economic environment within which they are being used, and the effects of obsolescence on their use. When required, Sprint assesses the recoverability of other indefinite lived intangibles, including FCC licenses which are carried as a single unit of accounting. In assessing recoverability of FCC licenses, we estimate the fair value of such licenses using the Greenfield direct value method, which approximates value through estimating the discounted future cash flows of a hypothetical start up business. Assumptions key in estimating fair value under this method include, but are not limited to, capital expenditures, subscriber activations and deactivations, market share achieved, tax rates in effect and discount rate. A one percent decline in our assumed revenue growth rate used to estimate terminal value, a one percent decline in our assumed net cash flows or a one percent adverse change in any of the key assumptions referred to above would not result in an impairment of our FCC licenses as of the most recent testing date. A decline in the estimated fair value of FCC licenses of approximately 10% also would not result in an impairment of the carrying value. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) modified the accounting for Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements and Certain Revenue Arrangements that Include Software Elements. These modifications alter the methods previously required for allocating consideration received in multiple element arrangements to require revenue allocation based on a relative selling price method, including arrangements containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality. These modifications were effective beginning in the first quarter 2011 and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2010, the FASB amended the requirements for Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses. As a result of these amendments, an entity is required to disaggregate by portfolio segment or class certain existing disclosures and provide certain new disclosures about its financing receivables and related allowance for credit losses. The new disclosures as of the end of the reporting period are effective for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010, while the disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period were effective for the first quarter 2011, neither of which had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding Fair Value Measurement: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs, which resulted in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurement 50Table of Contentsunder both U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), including a consistent definition of the term "fair value." The amendments will be effective beginning in the first quarter 2012; however, we do not expect the effects to be material. The FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding Comprehensive Income: Presentation of Comprehensive Income in June 2011, which was subsequently revised in December 2011, that amends existing guidance to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income, in either one continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two consecutive financial statements. The guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in shareholders equity. The amendments will be effective beginning in the first quarter 2012, with early adoption permitted, require retrospective application, and will only effect presentation of information in our primary financial statements. We early adopted the new presentation requirements which resulted in reporting the components of comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss, rather than in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity, as previously reported.In September 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding Testing Goodwill for Impairment which is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities with the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The revised standard will be effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed beginning in the first quarter 2012, with early adoption permitted under certain circumstances. We early adopted the provisions of this standard as part of our annual assessment of goodwill with no effect on our financial statements.FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We include certain estimates, projections and other forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in our annual, quarterly and current reports, and in other publicly available material. Statements regarding expectations, including performance assumptions and estimates relating to capital requirements, as well as other statements that are not historical facts, are forward looking statements. These statements reflect managements judgments based on currently available information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements. With respect to these forward looking statements, management has made assumptions regarding, among other things, subscriber and network usage, subscriber growth and retention, pricing, operating costs, the timing of various events and the economic and regulatory environment. Future performance cannot be assured. Actual results may differ materially from those in the forward looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include: our ability to retain and attract subscribers;the ability of our competitors to offer products and services at lower prices due to lower cost structures;the effects of vigorous competition on a highly penetrated market, including the impact of competition on the price we are able to charge subscribers for services and equipment we provide and our ability to retain existing subscribers and attract new subscribers; the impact of equipment net subsidy costs; the impact of increased purchase commitments; the overall demand for our service offerings, including the impact of decisions of new or existing subscribers between our postpaid and prepaid services offerings and between our two network platforms; and the impact of new, emerging and competing technologies on our business;the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to fully implement our network modernization plan, Network Vision, to improve and enhance our networks and service offerings, improve our operating margins, implement our business strategies and provide competitive new technologies;the effective implementation of Network Vision, including timing, execution, technologies, and costs;our ability to migrate subscribers off the Nextel platform and mitigate related increases in churn;our ability to access additional spectrum, including through spectrum hosting arrangements;51Table of Contentschanges in available technology and the effects of such changes, including product substitutions and deployment costs;our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all; volatility in the trading price of our common stock, current economic conditions and our ability to access capital;the impact of unrelated parties not meeting our business requirements, including a significant adverse change in the ability or willingness of such parties to provide devices or infrastructure equipment for our networks;the costs and business risks associated with providing new services and entering new geographic markets; the financial performance of Clearwire and its ability to build, operate, and maintain its 4G network, including an LTE network;our ability to access Clearwires spectrum;the compatibility of Sprints LTE network with Clearwires LTE network;the effects of mergers and consolidations and new entrants in the communications industry and unexpected announcements or developments from others in the communications industry; unexpected results of litigation filed against us or our suppliers or vendors;the impact of adverse network performance;the costs or potential customer impacts of compliance with regulatory mandates including, but not limited to, compliance with the FCCs Report and Order to reconfigure the 800 MHz band;equipment failure, natural disasters, terrorist acts or other breaches of network or information technology security;one or more of the markets in which we compete being impacted by changes in political, economic or other factors such as monetary policy, legal and regulatory changes, or other external factors over which we have no control; andother risks referenced from time to time in this report, including in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors and other filings of ours with the SEC.The words may, could, "should," estimate, project, forecast, intend, expect, "anticipate," believe, target, plan, providing guidance and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are found throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and elsewhere in this report. Readers are cautioned that other factors, although not listed above, could also materially affect our future performance and operating results. The reader should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We are not obligated to publicly release any revisions to forward looking statements to reflect events after the date of this report, including unforeseen events. FINANCIAL STRATEGIES General Risk Management Policies Our board of directors has adopted a financial risk management policy that authorizes us to enter into derivative transactions, and all transactions comply with the policy. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes with the exception of equity rights obtained in connection with commercial agreements or strategic investments, usually in the form of warrants to purchase common shares. Derivative instruments are primarily used for hedging and risk management purposes. Hedging activities may be done for various purposes, including, but not limited to, mitigating the risks associated with an asset, liability, committed transaction or probable forecasted transaction. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through stringent credit approval and review processes, credit support agreements, continual review and monitoring of all counterparties, and thorough legal review of contracts. Exposure to market risk is controlled by regularly monitoring changes in hedge positions under normal and stress conditions to ensure they do not exceed established limits.52Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are primarily exposed to the market risk associated with unfavorable movements in interest rates, foreign currencies, and equity prices. The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors. Interest Rate Risk The communications industry is a capital intensive, technology driven business. We are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our borrowings. Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows. Specific interest rate risk includes: the risk of increasing interest rates on floating rate debt and the risk of increasing interest rates for planned new fixed rate long term financings or refinancings. About 95% of our debt as of December 31, 2011 was fixed rate debt. While changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt, there is no impact to earnings and cash flows because we intend to hold these obligations to maturity unless market and other conditions are favorable. We perform interest rate sensitivity analyses on our variable rate debt. These analyses indicate that a one percentage point change in interest rates would have an annual pre tax impact of $10 million on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2011. We also perform a sensitivity analysis on the fair market value of our outstanding debt. A 10% decline in market interest rates would cause a $927 million increase in the fair market value of our debt to $19.2 billion. Foreign Currency Risk We also enter into forward contracts and options in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Our foreign exchange risk management program focuses on reducing transaction exposure to optimize consolidated cash flow. We use foreign currency derivatives to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to settlement of international telecommunications access charges and the operation of our international subsidiaries. The dollar equivalent of our net foreign currency payables from international settlements was $8 million and the net foreign currency receivables from international operations was less than $1 million as of December 31, 2011. The potential immediate pre tax loss to us that would result from a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates based on these positions would be insignificant. Equity Risk We are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments. We invest in equity instruments of public companies for operational and strategic business purposes. These securities are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to volatility of the stock market and industries in which the companies operate. These securities, which are classified in investments on the consolidated balance sheets, primarily include equity method investments, such as our investment in Clearwire and available for sale securities. In certain business transactions, we are granted warrants to purchase the securities of other companies at fixed rates. These warrants are supplemental to the terms of the business transaction and are not designated as hedging instruments.
 
Item 7.Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Business Strategies and Key Priorities Sprint is a communications company offering a comprehensive range of wireless and wireline communications products and services that are designed to meet the needs of individual consumers, businesses, government subscribers and resellers. The communications industry has been and will continue to be highly competitive on the basis of the quality of service, the types of services and devices offered, and price. As discussed below in Effects on our Wireless Business of Postpaid Subscriber Losses, the Company has experienced significant losses of subscribers in the critical postpaid wireless market since the third quarter 2006, but, as a result of steps taken to retain and attract such subscribers, has reduced annual postpaid net subscriber losses beginning in 2009.Our business strategy is to be responsive to changing customer mobility demands by being innovative and differentiated in the marketplace. Our future growth plans and strategy revolve around achieving the following three key priorities: Improve the customer experience; Strengthen our brands; andGenerate operating cash flow. We have reduced confusion over pricing plans and complex bills with our Simply Everything and Everything Data plans and our Any Mobile Anytime feature. We also offer price plans tailored to business subscribers such as Business Advantage, which allows for the flexibility to mix and match plans that include voice, voice and messaging, or voice, messaging and data to meet individual business needs and also allows the Any Mobile Anytime feature with certain plans. To simplify and improve the customer experience, we continue to offer Ready Now, which trains our customers before they leave the store on how to use their mobile devices. For our business customers, we aim to increase their productivity by providing differentiated services that utilize the advantages of combining IP networks with wireless technology. This differentiation enables us to retain and acquire both wireline, wireless and combined wireline wireless subscribers on our networks. We have also continued to focus on further improving customer care. We implemented initiatives that are designed to improve call center processes and procedures, and standardized our performance measures through various metrics, including customer satisfaction ratings with respect to customer care, first call resolution, and calls per subscriber. Our product strategy is to provide our customers with a broad array of device selections and applications and services that run on these devices to meet the growing needs of customer mobility. Our multi functional device portfolio includes many cutting edge devices from various original equipment manufacturers (OEMs). Our mobile broadband portfolio consists of devices such as hotspots, which allow the connection of multiple WiFi enabled devices. Our networks can also be accessed through our portfolio of embedded tablets and laptop devices. We support the open development of applications, content and devices on our network platforms through products and services such as Google Voice as well as Google Wallet, which is an application using near field communication technology to enable smartphones to make purchases at select merchants. We have also launched multiple Sprint ID packs that download applications, widgets and other content related to a persons interests at the push of a button. In addition, we enable a variety of business and consumer third party relationships through our portfolio of machine to machine solutions, which we offer on a retail postpaid and wholesale basis. The machine to machine solutions portfolio provides a secure, real time and reliable wireless two way data connection across a broad range of connected devices including OEM devices and after market in vehicle connectivity and electric vehicle charging stations, point of sale systems, kiosks and vending machines, asset tracking, digital signage, security, smartgrid utilities, medical equipment, and a variety of other consumer electronics and appliances. Our prepaid portfolio includes multiple brands, each designed to appeal to specific customer segments. Boost Mobile serves subscribers who are voice and text messaging centric with its popular Monthly Unlimited plan with Shrinkage service where bills are reduced after six on time payments. Virgin Mobile serves subscribers who are device and data oriented with Beyond Talk plans and our broadband plan, Broadband2Go, that offer consumers control, flexibility, and connectivity through various communication vehicles. Assurance Wireless provides eligible subscribers, who meet income requirements or are receiving government assistance, with a free wireless phone and 27Table of Contents250 free minutes of national, local, and long distance monthly service.We have focused our wholesale business to enable our diverse network of customers to successfully grow their business by providing them with an array of network, product, and device solutions. This allows our customers to customize this full suite of value added solutions to meet the growing demands of their business. In addition to our brand and customer oriented goals, we continue to focus on generating increased operating cash flow through competitive rate plans for postpaid and prepaid subscribers, multi branded strategies, and effectively managing our cost structure to align with reduced revenues from fewer postpaid subscribers. Certain of our strategic decisions, such as Network Vision and the introduction of the iPhone, which on average carries a higher equipment net subsidy, will result in a reduction in cash flows from operations in the near term. However, we believe these actions will generate long term benefits, including growth in valuable postpaid subscribers, a reduction in variable cost of service per unit and long term accretion to cash flows from operations. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information. Network VisionIn December 2010, we announced Network Vision, a multi year network infrastructure initiative intended to provide subscribers with an enhanced network experience by improving voice quality, coverage, and data speeds, while enhancing network flexibility, reducing operating costs, and improving environmental sustainability through the utilization of multiple spectrum bands onto a single multi mode base station. In addition to implementing these multi mode base stations, this plan encompasses next generation push to talk technology with broadband capabilities and the integration of multi mode chipsets into smartphones, tablets and other broadband devices, including machine to machine products. Through the successful deployment of Network Vision, we expect to migrate to a single nationwide network allowing for the consolidation and optimization of our 800 megahertz (MHz) and 1.9 gigahertz (GHz) spectrum, as well as other spectrum owned by third parties, into multi mode stations allowing us to repurpose spectrum to enhance coverage, particularly around the in building experience. The multi mode technology also utilizes software based solutions with interchangeable hardware to provide greater network flexibility, which also allows for the deployment of LTE.The first stages of equipment testing began in the first quarter of 2011, and we have achieved our initial technical milestones. Deployment has begun on approximately 38,000 cell sites, and we powered on our first multi mode base station on December 6, 2011. We expect to commercially launch this new technology in certain markets by mid year 2012. On October 2, 2011, we launched Sprint Direct Connect, which is the next generation of push to talk technology. Further deployments of Network Vision technology, including enhancements of Sprint Direct Connect, are expected to continue through early 2014. We expect the plan to bring financial benefit to the Company through migration to one common network, which is expected to reduce network maintenance and operating costs through capital efficiencies, reduced energy costs, lower roaming expenses, backhaul savings, and the eventual reduction in total cell sites. The successful deployment related to these changes in technology will result in incremental charges during the period of implementation including, but not limited to, an increase in depreciation and amortization associated with existing assets, both Nextel and Sprint platform related, due to changes in our estimates of the remaining useful lives of long lived assets, and the expected timing of asset retirement obligations, which we expect will have a material impact on our results of operations. We recorded a charge of $78 million related to network equipment, which has not been placed into service and that is no longer necessary for managements strategic plans. In the first quarter of 2012, we formalized our plans to decommission roughly one third of our total Nextel platform, or 9,600 towers, by the end of 2012. We also expect to be completed with our transition of customers from the Nextel platform to our Sprint platform by the end of 2013, which should allow us to decommission the remainder of our Nextel platform sites. As a result, in the first quarter 2012, we revised our estimates of the expected useful lives of certain Nextel platform assets and asset retirement obligations through the end of 2013. Accordingly, approximately $2 billion of the remaining $3.6 billion net book value of Nextel platform assets is expected to be accelerated through depreciation expense, of which a disproportionate amount is expected to be recognized during 2012. The exact timing of the acceleration is dependent upon when the assets are expected to be phased out of service. These estimates are derived from our internal decommissioning plan, which is still evolving. We estimate the incremental effect of accelerated depreciation related to Nextel platform assets in our 2012 results to be in the range of approximately $1.2 billion to $1.5 billion. 28Table of ContentsIn addition, we are experiencing increased data usage by subscribers, which has required additional capital expenditures of data capacity equipment on our current Sprint platform. As we deploy Network Vision, we intend to maximize the use of previously deployed data capacity equipment when possible; however, based on our capacity needs during the implementation period of Network Vision, we expect additional data capacity expenditures that will not be compatible with the deployment of Network Visions multi mode technology. As a result, the estimated useful lives of such equipment will be shortened, as compared to similar prior capital expenditures, through the date in which Network Vision equipment is deployed and in service. Spectrum HostingOur Network Vision multi mode network technology is designed to utilize a single base station capable of handling various spectrum bands, including our 800 MHz and 1.9 GHz spectrum as well as spectrum bands owned or accessed by other parties. In June 2011, we entered into a 15 year arrangement with LightSquared LP and LightSquared Inc. (collectively, LightSquared). Under the terms of the arrangement, and in conjunction with our Network Vision deployment, we agreed to deploy and operate an LTE network capable of utilizing the 1.6 GHz spectrum licensed to or available to LightSquared during the term of the arrangement, a service we refer to as spectrum hosting. The arrangement contains contingencies related to possible interference issues with LightSquareds spectrum, including the right of Sprint to terminate the arrangement if certain conditions are not met by LightSquared. As of December 31, 2011, the Company had received $310 million of advanced payments from LightSquared for future services to be performed under the spectrum hosting agreement.Beginning in December 2011, through a series of amendments, the arrangement was modified to, among other things, extend the date in which Sprint has the right to terminate the arrangement and suspend Sprints obligation to incur any further cost or expense related to performance under the original agreement. Under the amended arrangement, Sprint, for any reason, including but not limited to FCC action or inaction, or no reason at all, may terminate the agreement after March 15, 2012 and before April 30, 2012. If LightSquared secures lenders consent for modifications to the agreement, Sprints right to terminate will be deferred until June 25, 2012 and will continue through December 31, 2012. In addition, the parties definitively agreed that approximately $236 million of the total $310 million of advanced payments made by LightSquared represent payment for incremental costs or obligations incurred by Sprint under the original agreement in support of LightSquared. The parties agreed that this amount is irrevocably and unconditionally paid and will not be subject to dispute or claim by LightSquared. Accordingly, Sprint will refund up to approximately $74 million of Lightsquareds initial prepayments, of which $65 million will be paid on the earlier of LightSquareds lenders consent or March 15, 2012, and the remaining $9 million will remain subject to the termination and unwind provisions of the original agreement and will be returned to LightSquared upon termination, less any additional incremental cost or obligations incurred by Sprint in support of LightSquared. In the event the arrangement is terminated for LightSquareds material breach, non payment or insolvency, Sprint maintains a second lien on certain of LightSquareds assets, including spectrum assets.The $236 million, which has been recorded as a current liability, will be recognized as other operating income, net of the associated costs, in the event of termination assuming all other uncertainties have been resolved. Alternatively, should Sprint and LightSquared agree to proceed with the hosting arrangement, the $236 million will be recognized as revenue as the hosting services are performed.Effects on our Wireless Business of Postpaid Subscriber Losses The following table shows annual net additions/(losses) of postpaid subscribers by platform for the past five years, excluding subscribers obtained through business combinations. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 2008 2007 ( in thousands)Sprint platform net additions/(losses)1,283 734 (1,191) (437) 3,131Nextel platform net losses(1,381) (1,589) (2,355) (3,636) (4,355)Total net losses of postpaid subscribers(98) (855) (3,546) (4,073) (1,224)As shown by the table below under Results of Operations, Wireless segment earnings represented approximately 84% of our total consolidated segment earnings in 2011. The wireless industry is subject to competition to retain and acquire subscribers of wireless services. Most markets in which we operate have high rates 29Table of Contentsof penetration for wireless services. Wireless carriers accordingly must attract a greater proportion of new subscribers from competitors rather than from first time subscribers. Within the Wireless segment, postpaid wireless services represent the most significant contributors to earnings, and are driven by the number of postpaid subscribers to our services, as well as the average revenue per subscriber or user (ARPU). To address and reduce net postpaid subscriber losses, we have taken initiatives to strengthen the Sprint brand and continue to increase market awareness of the improvements that have been achieved in the customer experience, including the speed and dependability of our networks. We have also introduced new devices, including the iPhone in the fourth quarter of 2011, improving our overall lineup and providing a competitive portfolio for customer selection, as well as competitive rate plans providing simplicity and value.The Company has significantly improved net postpaid subscriber results subsequent to the first quarter 2009 as a result of actions taken to improve customer service, device selection and value oriented service offerings. In conjunction with Network Vision, the Company continues to focus on the growth of the Sprint platform while simultaneously targeting retention of Nextel platform customers through competitive offerings on the Sprint platform, which includes Sprint Direct Connect. As a result of our plans, we expect that customer churn on the Nextel platform, both postpaid and prepaid, will increase as we progress toward the decommissioning of the Nextel platform as well as increased competition for these subscribers. Although the Company continues to experience net losses of Nextel platform postpaid subscribers, these subscribers generally have a lower ARPU and have been partially offset by net additions of Sprint platform postpaid subscribers which, on average, carry a higher ARPU. For the year ended December 31, 2011, net postpaid subscriber losses of 98,000 represent an improvement of 757,000, or 89% compared to the same period one year ago and net prepaid subscriber additions of 2.5 million represent an improvement of 874,000, or 53% compared to the same period one year ago. Wireless retail service revenue has begun to grow primarily due to the increased service revenue associated with our prepaid wireless offerings and increased postpaid ARPU due primarily to the $10 premium data add on charge associated with smartphones. If our trend of improved postpaid subscriber results does not continue, it could have a material negative impact on our financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity in 2012 and beyond. The Company believes the actions that have been taken, as described above, and that continue to be taken in marketing, customer service, device offerings, and network quality, should continue to improve net postpaid subscriber results.RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions)Wireless segment earnings$4,267 $4,531 $5,198Wireline segment earnings800 1,090 1,221Corporate, other and eliminations5 12 (12)Consolidated segment earnings5,072 5,633 6,407Depreciation and amortization(4,858) (6,248) (7,416)Other, net(106)20(389)Operating income (loss)108 (595) (1,398)Interest expense(1,011) (1,464) (1,450)Equity in losses of unconsolidated investments, net(1,730) (1,286) (803)Other (expense) income, net(3) 46 157Income tax (expense) benefit(254) (166) 1,058Net loss$(2,890) $(3,465) $(2,436)Consolidated segment earnings decreased $561 million, or 10%, in 2011 compared to 2010 and $774 million, or 12%, in 2010 compared to 2009. Consolidated segment earnings consist of our Wireless and Wireline segments, which are discussed below, and Corporate, other and eliminations. 30Table of ContentsDepreciation and Amortization Expense During 2011, Sprint completed studies of the estimated useful lives of depreciable assets, which reflects a reduction in the replacement rate of capital additions and was a primary factor for a decrease to depreciation expense of $619 million, or 12%, in 2011 compared to 2010. This decline is partially offset by an increase due to assets placed in service as a result of capital expenditures related to capacity to support increased data usage by our subscribers. As a result of expected increased capital expenditures related to Network Vision, we expect depreciation expense to increase over the next several years as those assets are placed in service. In addition, the successful deployment related to the changes in technology as a result of Network Vision is expected to result in incremental charges during the period of implementation including, but not limited to, an increase in depreciation and amortization associated with existing assets, both Nextel and Sprint platform related, due to changes in our estimates of the remaining useful lives of long lived assets, and the expected timing of asset retirement obligations, which we expect to have a material impact on our results of operations. Depreciation expense decreased $753 million, or 13%, in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a reduction in the replacement rate of capital additions resulting from reduced capital spending associated with our cost control actions beginning in 2008. The average annual capital expenditures for the three years ended 2007 were approximately $6.3 billion as compared to average annual capital expenditures of $2.5 billion for the three years ended 2010. Amortization expense declined $771 million, or 66%, in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to the absence of amortization for customer relationship intangible assets related to the 2005 acquisition of Nextel, which became fully amortized in the second quarter 2010. In addition, customer relationship intangible assets related to the acquisition of Nextel Partners, Inc. in 2006 and Virgin Mobile USA, Inc. (Virgin Mobile) in the fourth quarter 2009 became fully amortized in the second quarter 2011. Amortization expense declined $415 million, or 26%, in 2010 as compared to 2009, primarily due to the absence of amortization for customer relationship intangible assets related to the 2005 acquisition of Nextel which became fully amortized in the second quarter 2010. These reductions were partially offset by an increase in amortization related to customer relationship intangible assets acquired in connection with the iPCS, Inc. (iPCS) and Virgin Mobile acquisitions in the fourth quarter 2009. Customer relationships are amortized using the sum of the years digits method, resulting in higher amortization rates in early periods that decline over time.

During 2011 we recognized severance and exit costs of $28 million associated with actions in the fourth quarter of 2011. During 2010 we recognized $8 million of severance and exit costs primarily related to exit costs incurred in the second and fourth quarter 2010 associated with vacating certain office space which is no longer being utilized. We recognized $400 million in 2009 of severance and exit costs related to the separation of employees and organizational realignment initiatives. Asset impairments decreased by $47 million, or 38%, in 2011 compared to 2010 and increased $78 million, or 166%, in 2010 compared to 2009. Asset impairments primarily relate to assets that are no longer necessary for managements strategic plans. In 2011, 2010, and 2009 these impairments were primarily related to network asset equipment. Gains from asset dispositions and exchanges for 2010 and 2009 are primarily related to spectrum exchange transactions. Other changed $94 million in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in benefits resulting from favorable developments relating to access cost disputes with certain exchange carriers. 31Table of ContentsInterest Expense Interest expense decreased $453 million, or 31%, in 2011 as compared to 2010, primarily due to a $400 million increase in the amount of interest capitalized. The increase in capitalized interest is related to our plan to deploy certain spectrum licenses as part of Network Vision that were not previously utilized. The reduction in interest expense also includes a decrease of $115 million as a result of the repayment of $1.65 billion of Sprint Capital Corporation 7.625% senior notes in January 2011. The decrease was partially offset by increases in interest expense of $54 million as a result of the November 2011 Sprint Nextel Corporation issuance of $1 billion in principal of 11.50% senior notes due 2021 and $3 billion in principal of 9.00% guaranteed notes due 2018. Interest expense increased $14 million, or 1%, in 2010 as compared to 2009. This increase was primarily due to higher effective interest rates on our average long term debt balances and increased costs on our revolving credit facilities, which include the accelerated amortization of previously unamortized debt issuance costs from the retirement of our former credit facility in May 2010 partially offset by reductions in interest expense previously recorded as a result of favorable tax outcomes. The effective interest rate, which includes capitalized interest, on the weighted average long term debt balance of $19.1 billion, $20.6 billion, and $21.4 billion was 7.4%, 7.2%, and 6.8% for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. See Liquidity and Capital Resources for more information on the Companys financing activities. Equity in Losses of Unconsolidated Investments, net Clearwire owns and operates a next generation mobile broadband network that provides high speed residential and mobile Internet access services and residential voice services in communities throughout the country. Clearwire is an early stage company, and as such, heavily invested in building its network and acquiring other assets necessary to expand its WiMAX business during 2009 and 2010, which resulted in increased operating losses and reduced liquidity. In August 2011, Clearwire announced its intention to deploy an LTE network subject to the availability of additional funding. In December 2011, Clearwire issued additional equity and raised net proceeds of approximately $716 million. Additionally, in January 2012, Clearwire issued additional indebtedness and raised net proceeds of approximately $295 million. We expect Clearwire to continue to generate net losses in the near term as it executes its business plan, including the deployment of an LTE network. Our intent to hold our investment in Clearwire is based, in part, on our growing subscriber base of 4G WiMAX subscribers that utilize Clearwires network and our intent to sell 4G WiMAX devices through 2012.Equity in losses of unconsolidated investments primarily consists of our proportionate share of losses from our equity method investments. Equity losses associated with our investment in Clearwire consists of Sprints share of Clearwires net loss and other adjustments such as gains or losses associated with the dilution of Sprints ownership interest resulting from Clearwires equity issuances and other items recognized by Clearwire Corporation that do not effect Sprints economic interest. Equity in losses from Clearwire were $1.7 billion, $1.3 billion, and $803 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Equity in losses from Clearwire for 2011 and 2010 include charges of approximately $361 million and $97 million respectively, which are associated with Clearwires write off of certain network and other assets that no longer meet their strategic plans. The year ended December 31, 2011 also includes a $135 million pre tax impairment reflecting the reduction of our investment in Clearwire to its estimated fair value and a dilution loss of approximately $27 million associated with the fourth quarter reduction of our non controlling economic interest related to Clearwires equity issuance. The 2009 equity in losses of Clearwire include a pre tax dilution loss of $154 million recognized in the first quarter 2009, representing the finalization of ownership percentages associated with the formation of Clearwire, which was subject to change based on the trading price of Clearwire stock during the 90 days subsequent to the November 2008 closing. Additional declines in the value of Clearwire may require us to evaluate the decline in relation to the carrying value of our investment in Clearwire. A conclusion by us that additional declines in the value of Clearwire are other than temporary could result in an additional impairment, which could be material.On November 30, 2011, Sprint entered into new agreements with Clearwire that established long term pricing terms for 4G services, both WiMAX and LTE. Under terms of the agreements, Sprint is required to pay Clearwire $926 million in total over the course of 2012 and 2013 in exchange for unlimited WiMAX services during those years. The agreements also establish long term usage based pricing for LTE services in 2012 and beyond and WiMAX services in 2014 and beyond. Under the terms Sprint may also make a series of refundable prepayments up to $350 million for LTE services, if Clearwire achieves certain build out targets and network specifications by June 2013 or obtains purchase commitments for LTE services from other customers. These payments, beginning in 2013, 32Table of Contentswill be applied towards LTE usage over the remaining term of the contract. In addition, the agreements provided improved terms and competitive pricing for re wholesaling of WiMAX services by Sprint beginning in 2012. Lastly, as part of the agreements, on January 2, 2012, Sprint provided $150 million to Clearwire in exchange for a promissory note with a stated interest rate of 11.5% that matures in two installments of $75 million plus accrued interest in January 2013 and in January 2014. Sprint, at its sole discretion, can choose to offset any amounts payable by Clearwire under this promissory note against amounts owed by Sprint under the MVNO agreement.Other (expense) income, net The following table provides additional information of items included in Other (expense) income, net for each of the three years ended December 31, 2011. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions)Interest income$36 $35 $34Realized loss from investments(6) (3) (29)Gain on previously held non controlling interest in Virgin Mobile 151Loss on early retirement of debt(33) Other 14 1Total$(3) $46 $157Interest income remained relatively stable for each of the periods presented. Realized loss from investments was consistent in 2011, as compared to 2010, and decreased $26 million, or 90%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily due to fewer sales of marketable securities. As a result of the acquisition of Virgin Mobile, a non cash gain of $151 million ($92 million after tax) was recognized in the fourth quarter 2009 related to the estimated fair value over net carrying value of our previously held non controlling interest in Virgin Mobile. The loss on early retirement of debt in 2011 was due to the redemption of all of our outstanding $2.0 billion Sprint Capital Corporation 8.375% senior notes due March 2012. Income Tax (Expense) Benefit The consolidated effective tax rate was an expense of approximately 10% and 5% in 2011 and 2010, respectively, and a benefit of approximately 30% in 2009. The income tax expense for 2011 and 2010 and the benefit for 2009 include a $1.2 billion, $1.4 billion, and $281 million net increase to the valuation allowance for federal and state deferred tax assets primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards generated during the respective periods. The 2011 increase to the valuation allowance was also inclusive of $21 million associated with federal income tax effects of recently enacted changes in corporate state income tax laws, and resulted in a total charge to income tax expense of $59 million. We do not expect to record significant tax benefits on future net operating losses until our circumstances justify the recognition of such benefits. Additional information related to items impacting the effective tax rates can be found in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 33Table of ContentsSegment Earnings Wireless Wireless segment earnings are primarily a function of wireless service revenue, costs to acquire subscribers, network and interconnection costs to serve those subscribers and other Wireless segment operating expenses. The costs to acquire our subscribers include the net cost at which we sell our devices, referred to as equipment net subsidies, as well as the marketing and sales costs incurred to attract those subscribers. Network costs primarily represent switch and cell site costs and interconnection costs, which generally consist of per minute usage fees and roaming fees paid to other carriers. The remaining costs associated with operating the Wireless segment include the costs to operate our customer care organization and administrative support. Wireless service revenue, costs to acquire subscribers, and variable network and interconnection costs fluctuate with the changes in our subscriber base and their related usage, but some cost elements do not fluctuate in the short term with these changes. Wireless segment earnings have declined consecutively for each of the annual periods ending December 31, 2009, 2010 and 2011. Wireless segment earnings were approximately $4.3 billion, $4.5 billion and $5.2 billion for each of the twelve month periods ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As discussed in the section Effects on our Wireless Business of Postpaid Subscriber Losses, the Company has significantly reduced the net postpaid subscriber losses occurring since 2009 and increased subscriber net additions within prepaid, wholesale and affiliates. During 2011, the Company entered into a purchase commitment with Apple, Inc. to purchase a minimum number of smartphones, which on average, is expected to carry a higher subsidy per unit than other smartphones we sell. In addition, during 2012, we expect to make further progress on Network Vision, including certain costs associated with the ongoing decommissioning efforts of the Nextel platform. As a result, we expect that wireless segment earnings will decline in 2012 as compared to 2011 until we benefit from Network Vision, through reduced network and operating costs, and begin to see further increases in retail service revenue through improved total retail postpaid net additions sufficient to recover these increased equipment net subsidy and acquisition costs.The following table provides an overview of the results of operations of our Wireless segment for each of the three years ended December 31, 2011.

Service revenue consists of fixed monthly recurring charges, variable usage charges and miscellaneous fees such as activation fees, directory assistance, roaming, equipment protection, late payment and early termination charges and certain regulatory related fees, net of service credits. The ability of our Wireless segment to generate service revenues is primarily a function of: revenue generated from each subscriber, which in turn is a function of the types and amount of services utilized by each subscriber and the rates charged for those services; andthe number of subscribers that we serve, which in turn is a function of our ability to retain existing and acquire new subscribers.Retail comprises those subscribers to whom Sprint directly provides wireless services, whether those services are provided on a postpaid or a prepaid basis. Retail service revenue increased $1.5 billion, or 6%, in 2011 as compared to 2010 and increased $391 million, or 2% in 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase in retail service revenue in 2011 as compared to 2010 reflects an increase in postpaid service revenue related to our $10 premium data add on charge required for all smartphones and greater popularity of unlimited and bundled plans, combined with other fee increases including an increase in our handset protection plan. The increase was also driven by attracting more subscribers to our Boost and Virgin Mobile prepaid brands who are choosing higher rate plans to take advantage of international offerings as well as the increased availability of smartphones and increased subscribers from new market launches for our Assurance Wireless brand. The majority of the increase in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily driven by attracting subscribers to the Companys National Boost Monthly Unlimited prepaid plan in addition to service revenue related to the subscribers acquired through our fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions of Virgin Mobile and iPCS. This increase in retail service revenue was partially offset by a decrease in postpaid service revenue driven by a reduction in the Companys average number of postpaid subscribers of approximately 1.4 million, or 4%, in 2010 as compared to 2009. Wholesale and affiliates are those subscribers who are served through 3G MVNO and affiliate relationships and other arrangements through which wireless services are sold by Sprint to other companies that resell those services to subscribers. Wholesale, affiliate and other revenues increased $44 million, or 20%, for 2011 as compared to 2010, and decreased $329 million, or 60%, for 2010 as compared to 2009. The majority of the increase in 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily a result of growth in our 3G MVNO relationships. Specifically, growth in subscribers on the Lifeline program offered through our MVNOs reselling prepaid services, which is similar to our Assurance Wireless offering, contributed to revenue growth. The majority of the decrease in 2010 as compared to 2009 was due to the transfer of 5.4 million subscribers from wholesale and affiliates into postpaid and prepaid classifications as a result of the fourth quarter 2009 acquisitions of Virgin Mobile and iPCS. The remaining decline in 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to losses from two of our large MVNOs throughout 2009 in addition to lower revenues received from services provided through our machine to machine initiative. Approximately 29% of our wholesale and affiliate subscribers represent a growing number of connected devices. These devices generate revenue from usage which varies depending on the solution being utilized. Average revenue per connected device is generally significantly lower than revenue from other wholesale and affiliate subscribers; however, the cost to service these customers is also lower resulting in a higher profit margin as a percent of revenue.35Table of ContentsAverage Monthly Service Revenue per Subscriber and Subscriber Trends The table below summarizes average number of retail subscribers and ARPU for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009. Additional information about the number of subscribers, net additions to subscribers, ARPU, and average rates of monthly postpaid and prepaid subscriber churn for each quarter since the first quarter 2009 may be found in the tables on the following pages. Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (subscribers in thousands)Average postpaid subscribers 32,935 33,249 34,640Average prepaid subscribers 13,672 11,272 5,313Average retail subscribers46,607 44,521 39,953ARPU(1): Postpaid$57.27 $54.94 $55.83Prepaid$27.40 $27.76 $32.64Average retail$48.51 $48.06 $52.74 (1)ARPU is calculated by dividing service revenue by the sum of the average number of subscribers in the applicable service category. Changes in average monthly service revenue reflect subscribers for either the postpaid or prepaid service category who change rate plans, the level of voice and data usage, the amount of service credits which are offered to subscribers, plus the net effect of average monthly revenue generated by new subscribers and deactivating subscribers. Postpaid ARPU for 2011 increased as compared to 2010 primarily due to increased revenues from the $10 premium data add on charges for all smartphones and fee increases in our handset protection plan. Postpaid ARPU for 2010 declined slightly as compared to 2009 due to declines in overage revenues resulting from the increased popularity of fixed rate bundled plans including the Any Mobile AnytimeSM feature. Prepaid ARPU for 2011 declined slightly compared to 2010 primarily as a result of net additions of our Assurance Wireless brand whose subscribers carry a lower ARPU, partially offset by an increase in ARPU for the remaining prepaid brands as subscribers are choosing higher priced plans to take advantage of international offerings and the increased availability of smartphones. Prepaid ARPU decreased during 2010 as compared to 2009 due to prepaid subscribers acquired in our fourth quarter 2009 business combination of Virgin Mobile as well as net subscriber additions under our Assurance Wireless brand launched in early 2010, which carry a lower average revenue per subscriber compared to Sprints other prepaid subscribers. Average retail ARPU increased slightly for 2011 compared to 2010 primarily as a result of the increased postpaid ARPU which was partially offset by an increased weighting of average prepaid subscribers to total subscribers which carry a lower ARPU. The lower prepaid ARPU and the increased weighting of average prepaid subscribers to total subscribers resulted in a decline in our average retail ARPU for 2010 compared to 2009.36Table of ContentsThe following table shows (a) net additions (losses) of wireless subscribers and (b) our total subscribers as of the end of each quarterly period for the past twelve quarters.

For postpaid accounts comprising multiple subscribers, such as family plans and enterprise accounts, net deactivations are defined as deactivations in excess of customer activations in a particular account within 30 days. Postpaid and prepaid churn consist of both voluntary churn, where the subscriber makes his or her own determination to cease being a customer, and involuntary churn, where the customers service is terminated due to a lack of payment or other reasons. 38Table of ContentsRetail Postpaid SubscribersWe lost 98,000 net postpaid subscribers during 2011 as compared to losing 855,000 and 3.5 million net postpaid subscribers during 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net postpaid subscriber losses improved by 757,000, or 89%, during 2011 as compared to 2010 and 2.7 million, or 76% during 2010 as compared to 2009. Of the 33 million total subscribers included in postpaid, approximately 2% represent connected devices. Net additions of connected devices were 82,000 during 2011, as compared to net additions of 24,000 and 43,000 during the same periods in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Our improvement in net postpaid subscriber losses can be attributed to our improvements in retail postpaid gross additions and lower postpaid churn resulting from simplified and value driven bundled offers, a more competitive device line up, as well as our improvements in overall customer experience and customer care satisfaction. We plan to migrate Nextel platform push to talk subscribers by providing competitive offerings on the Sprint platform, which includes future offerings on our multi mode network, such as Sprint Direct Connect. Retail Prepaid SubscribersWe added approximately 2.5 million net prepaid subscribers during 2011 as compared to adding 1.6 million and 2.6 million net prepaid subscribers in 2010 and 2009, respectively. Net prepaid subscriber additions improved by 874,000, or 53%, during 2011 as compared to 2010 and declined 914,000, or 36%, during 2010 as compared to 2009. Our improvement in net prepaid subscriber additions for 2011 as compared to 2010 were driven by net additions from the Assurance Wireless brand primarily as a result of new market launches and increased advertising and promotions. Our net prepaid subscriber additions in 2010 were principally driven by net additions from the Assurance Wireless and Boost Mobile brands, partially offset by net losses associated with the Virgin Mobile brand including a transfer of 49,000 subscribers from prepaid to wholesale and affiliates as a result of a sale and transfer of customers to an affiliate. The Company expects to continue the trend of prepaid subscriber losses under the Nextel platform as we focus efforts to retain and attract such subscribers to our offerings on the Sprint platform. Prepaid subscribers are generally deactivated between 60 days and up to 150 days from the date of activation or replenishment; however, prior to account deactivation, targeted retention programs can be offered to qualifying subscribers to maintain ongoing service by providing up to an additional 150 days to make a replenishment. Subscribers targeted through these retention offers are not included in the calculation of churn until their retention offer expires without a replenishment to their account. As a result, end of period prepaid subscribers include subscribers engaged in these retention programs. Retention offers to these targeted subscribers declined as a percentage of our total prepaid subscriber base during 2011 as compared to 2010.Wholesale and Affiliate SubscribersWholesale and affiliate subscribers represent customers that are served on our networks through companies that resell our wireless services to their subscribers, customers residing in affiliate territories and connected devices that utilize our network. During 2011, wholesale and affiliate subscriber net additions were 2.7 million resulting in approximately 7.2 million wholesale and affiliate subscribers as of December 31, 2011, compared to approximately 4.5 million and 3.5 million wholesale and affiliate subscribers as of December 31, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Wholesale and affiliate subscriber net additions improved by 1.7 million, or 171%, during 2011 as compared to 2010 and 1.1 million, or 820%, during 2010 as compared to 2009. The increase in the wholesale subscriber base during 2011 as compared to 2010 was primarily driven by net additions from the Lifeline program offered through our MVNOs reselling prepaid services. The increase in the wholesale subscriber base during 2010 as compared to 2009 was primarily due to subscriber additions in other MVNO relationships. Of the 7.2 million total subscribers included in wholesale and affiliates, approximately 29% represent connected devices. Net additions of connected devices were 217,000 during 2011, as compared to net additions of 152,000 and 846,000 during 2010 and 2009, respectively. 39Table of ContentsCost of Services Cost of services consists primarily of:costs to operate and maintain our networks, including direct switch and cell site costs, such as rent, utilities, maintenance, labor costs associated with network employees, and spectrum frequency leasing costs; fixed and variable interconnection costs, the fixed component of which consists of monthly flat rate fees for facilities leased from local exchange carriers based on the number of cell sites and switches in service in a particular period and the related equipment installed at each site, and the variable component of which generally consists of per minute use fees charged by wireline providers for calls terminating on their networks, which fluctuate in relation to the level and duration of those terminating calls;long distance costs paid to the Wireline segment;costs to service and repair devices;regulatory fees;roaming fees paid to other carriers; and fixed and variable costs relating to payments to third parties for the use of their proprietary data applications, such as messaging, music, TV, and navigation services by our subscribers.Cost of services increased $619 million, or 7%, in 2011 compared to 2010, primarily reflecting increased roaming due to higher 4G MVNO data usage. In addition, higher service and repair costs were incurred driven by the increase in the cost per unit of new and used devices due to the growth in smartphone popularity. We are also in the process of renegotiating cell site leases to enable further flexibility in connection with Network Vision, including spectrum hosting services, which has resulted in a net increase to rent expense and is expected to continue until such time we can successfully deploy Network Vision and benefit from an overall reduction in our total portfolio of tower leases. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in long distance network costs as a result of lower market rates and a decline in payments to third party vendors for use of their proprietary data applications and premium services as a result of contract renegotiations providing more favorable rates. Cost of services decreased $96 million, or 1%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 primarily reflecting a decline in service and repair costs by focusing on device repairs and refurbishment rather than utilizing new devices, a decline in long distance network costs as a result of lower market rates, as well as a decline in payments to third party vendors providing premium services as a result of changing from usage based payments to flat rates. This decline was partially offset by increased roaming due to higher data usage and an increase in license fees as a result of the continued growth in smartphone devices, which carry higher fees.Equipment Net Subsidy We recognize equipment revenue and corresponding costs of devices when title of the device passes to the dealer or end user subscriber. Our marketing plans assume that devices typically will be sold at prices below cost, which is consistent with industry practice, as subscriber retention efforts often include providing incentives to subscribers such as offering new devices at discounted prices. We reduce equipment revenue for these discounts offered directly to the subscriber, and for certain payments to third party dealers to reimburse the dealer for point of sale discounts that are offered to the end user subscriber primarily associated with obtaining a service plan. Additionally, the cost of devices is reduced by any rebates that are earned from the supplier. Cost of products (primarily devices and accessories) also include order fulfillment related expenses and write downs of device and related accessory inventory for shrinkage and obsolescence. Equipment cost in excess of the revenue generated from equipment sales is referred to in the industry as equipment net subsidy. Equipment revenue increased $208 million, or 8%, in 2011 compared to 2010 and cost of products increased $1.1 billion, or 16%, in 2011 compared to 2010. The increase in both equipment revenue and cost of products is primarily due to a higher average sales price and cost per device sold for both postpaid and prepaid devices in addition to an overall increase in the number of prepaid devices sold, partially offset by a decline in the number of postpaid devices sold. Equipment revenue increased $749 million, or 38%, in 2010 compared to 2009 and cost of products increased $1.4 billion, or 26%, in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to an increase in the number of postpaid devices sold with a greater mix of devices that have a higher average sales price and cost, as well as an increase in the number of prepaid devices sold. 40Table of ContentsSelling, General and Administrative Expense Sales and marketing costs primarily consist of customer acquisition costs, including commissions paid to our indirect dealers, third party distributors and retail sales force for new device activations and upgrades, residual payments to our indirect dealers, payments made to OEMs for direct source equipment, payroll and facilities costs associated with our retail sales force, marketing employees, advertising, media programs and sponsorships, including costs related to branding. General and administrative expenses primarily consist of costs for billing, customer care and information technology operations, bad debt expense and administrative support activities, including collections, legal, finance, human resources, corporate communications, strategic planning, and technology and product development. Sales and marketing expense was $5.1 billion, an increase of $246 million, or 5%, in 2011 from 2010 and $4.8 billion, an increase of $322 million, or 7%, in 2010 from 2009. The increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2011 as compared to the prior period is primarily due to reimbursements for point of sale discounts for iPhones, which are directly sourced by distributors from Apple and accounted for as sales expense, as well as the additional costs associated with our increase in subscriber gross additions, slightly offset by a decrease in media spend. Point of sale discounts are included in the determination of equipment net subsidy when we purchase and resell devices. The increase in sales and marketing expenses for the year ended December 31, 2010 as compared to the prior period is primarily due to the additional costs associated with our increase in subscriber gross additions combined with incremental costs associated with our business combinations in the fourth quarter 2009, offset by a decline in marketing expenditures related to our cost cutting initiatives. General and administrative costs were $4.0 billion, an insignificant increase of $11 million in 2011 from 2010 and $4.0 billion, a decrease of $203 million, or 5%, in 2010 from 2009. The slight increase in general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2011 reflects an increase in bad debt expense partially offset by a reduction in customer care costs as well as reductions in prepaid integration costs incurred in 2010 associated with our business acquisitions. The decline in general and administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2010 reflects a reduction in customer care costs and minor continued effects of workforce reductions and cost cutting initiatives announced in 2009 offset by increases as a result of the fourth quarter 2009 business acquisitions of Virgin Mobile and iPCS in addition to an increase in bad debt expense. Customer care costs decreased $120 million in 2011 as compared to 2010 and $87 million in 2010 as compared to 2009. The improvement in customer care costs is largely attributable to customer care quality initiatives and price plan simplification that have resulted in a reduction in calls per subscriber, which allowed for further optimization of call center resources. Bad debt expense was $552 million for the year ended December 31, 2011 representing a $129 million increase, as compared to bad debt expense of $423 million in 2010. The increase in bad debt expense primarily reflects an increase in the aging of accounts receivable outstanding greater than 60 days combined with an increase in the average write off per account. For the year ended December 31, 2010, bad debt expense increased $31 million as compared to bad debt expense of $392 million in 2009. The increase in bad debt expense primarily reflects 2009 reductions in allowances for bad debt due to increased rates of recovery. We reassess our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly. Changes in our allowance for doubtful accounts are largely attributable to the analysis of historical collection experience and changes, if any, in credit policies established for subscribers. Our mix of prime postpaid subscribers to total postpaid subscribers was 82% as of December 31, 2011 as compared to 84% as of December 31, 2010. Segment Earnings Wireline Wireline segment earnings are primarily a function of wireline service revenue, network and interconnection costs, and other Wireline segment operating expenses. Network costs primarily represent special access costs and interconnection costs, which generally consist of domestic and international per minute usage fees paid to other carriers. The remaining costs associated with operating the Wireline segment include the costs to operate our customer care and billing organizations in addition to administrative support. Wireline service revenue and variable network and interconnection costs fluctuate with the changes in our customer base and their related usage, but some cost elements do not fluctuate in the short term with the changes in our customer usage. Our wireline services provided to our Wireless segment are generally accounted for based on market rates, which we believe approximate fair value. The Company generally re establishes these rates at the beginning of each fiscal year. Over the past several years, there has been an industry wide trend of lower rates due to increased competition from other wireline and wireless communications companies as well as cable and Internet service providers. For 2012, we expect wireline segment earnings to decline by approximately $180 to $220 million to reflect changes in 41Table of Contentsmarket prices for services provided by our Wireline segment to our Wireless segment. This decline in wireline segment earnings related to intercompany pricing will not affect our consolidated results of operations as our Wireless segment will benefit from an equivalent reduction in cost of service. The following table provides an overview of the results of operations of our Wireline segment for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009.

The 2011 decrease was primarily driven by overall price declines of which $115 million was related to the decline in prices for the sale of services to our Wireless segment as well as volume declines due to customer churn. The 2010 decrease was primarily driven by volume declines due to customer churn as well as overall price declines. Voice revenues generated from the sale of services to our Wireless segment represented 34% of total voice revenues in 2011 as compared to 33% in 2010 and 31% in 2009. Data Revenues Data revenues reflect sales of data services, including ATM, frame relay and managed network services. Data revenues decreased $59 million, or 11%, in 2011 as compared to 2010 and $143 million, or 22%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 as a result of customer churn driven by the focus to no longer provide frame relay and ATM services in each of those periods. Data revenues generated from the provision of services to the Wireless segment represented 35% of total data revenue in 2011 as compared to 27% in 2010 and 19% in 2009. Internet Revenues Internet revenues reflect sales of IP based data services, including MPLS, VoIP and SIP. Internet revenues decreased $297 million, or 14%, in 2011 from 2010 and $118 million, or 5%, in 2010 from 2009. Certain MSOs have decided to in source their digital voice products resulting in a $181 million decrease in 2011 as compared to 2010. In addition, Internet revenues generated from the sale of services to our Wireless segment declined by $94 million due to a decline in prices. The 2010 decrease was due to a decline in new IP customers with lower market rates as a result of increased competition. Internet revenues generated from the provision of services to the Wireless segment represented 8% of total Internet revenues in 2011 as compared to 10% in 2010 and 11% in 2009. Other Revenues Other revenues, which primarily consist of sales of customer premises equipment, decreased $24 million, or 25% in 2011 as compared to 2010 and $14 million, or 13%, in 2010 as compared to 2009 as a result of fewer projects in 2011 and 2010. 42Table of ContentsCosts of Services and Products Costs of services and products include access costs paid to local phone companies, other domestic service providers and foreign phone companies to complete calls made by our domestic subscribers, costs to operate and maintain our networks, and costs of equipment. Costs of services and products decreased $314 million, or 9%, in 2011 from 2010 and $344 million, or 9%, in 2010 from 2009. The decrease in 2011 and 2010 was primarily due to lower access expense as a result of savings initiatives and migration from data to IP based technologies in addition to declining voice volumes. Service gross margin percentage decreased from 35% in 2009 to 34% in 2010 and further decreased to 31% in 2011 as a result of a decrease in net service revenue partially offset by a decrease in costs of services and products.Selling, General and Administrative Expense Selling, general and administrative expense decreased $110 million, or 17%, in 2011 as compared to 2010 and $114 million, or 15% in 2010 as compared 2009. The decrease in 2011 was primarily due to a reduction in shared administrative and employee related costs required to support the Wireline segment as a result of the decline in revenue. The decrease in 2010 was primarily due to a reduction in employee headcount and a decline in the use of outside services and maintenance as part of our cost cutting initiatives. Total selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of net services revenue was 12% in 2011 and 13% in 2010 and 2009. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash Flow Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 (in millions)Net cash provided by operating activities$3,691 $4,815 $4,891Net cash used in investing activities(3,443) (2,556) (3,844)Net cash provided by (used in) financing activities26 (905) (919)Operating Activities Net cash provided by operating activities of $3.7 billion in 2011 decreased $1.1 billion from the same period in 2010. The decrease resulted from an increase in vendor and labor related payments of $2.6 billion, which primarily related to an increase in the average cost of postpaid and prepaid devices sold and related increases in inventory, increased roaming due to higher 3G and 4G data usage, as well as $136 million in pension contribution payments. This was offset by $1.2 billion of increased cash received from customers primarily due to increases in total subscriber net additions and $310 million received for spectrum hosting. In addition, cash paid for interest decreased by $430 million, of which, $395 million was associated with interest capitalization as a result of Network Vision and was reflected as an investing activity. Net cash provided by operating activities of $4.8 billion in 2010 decreased by $76 million from 2009, primarily due to a $196 million decrease in cash received from our subscribers resulting from a decline in our postpaid subscriber customer base, an increase of $217 million in cash paid to our suppliers and employees, and an increase of $36 million in cash paid for interest. These were partially offset by an increase of $170 million in cash received for income tax refunds. Net cash provided by operating activities for 2009 also includes a cash payment of $200 million resulting from a contribution to the Company pension plan. Investing Activities Net cash used in investing activities for 2011 increased by $887 million from 2010, due to increases of $480 million in purchases of short term investments and $1.2 billion in capital expenditures. Increases in capital expenditures are related to the addition of data capacity to our wireless networks and Network Vision and also include $395 million due to the recognition of capitalized interest on qualifying activities associated with Network Vision primarily related to the carrying value of spectrum licenses not yet placed in service. These increases in use of cash were offset by increases of $825 million in proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments and a decrease of $201 million in expenditures related to FCC licenses as determined by specific operations requirements of the Report and Order. We also received $135 million in reimbursements from the mobile satellite service (MSS) entrants for their pro rata portion of our costs of clearing a portion of the 1.9 GHz spectrum. In 43Table of Contentsaddition, during the fourth quarter 2011, Sprint invested an additional $331 million in Clearwire as a result of an amendment to our agreements and Clearwires successful offering of additional Class A shares to the market.Net cash used in investing activities for 2010 decreased by $1.3 billion from 2009, due to a decrease of $300 million in purchases of short term investments and a decrease of $132 million in expenditures related to FCC licenses as determined by specific operation requirements of the Report and Order. These decreases were partially offset by reduced proceeds from sales and maturities of short term investments of $418 million and increased capital expenditures of $332 million to add coverage and capacity to our wireless networks. Sprint also increased its investment in Clearwire by $1.1 billion and acquired iPCS and Virgin Mobile for $560 million in 2009, which resulted in the remaining decline in 2010 as compared to 2009. Financing Activities Net cash provided by financing activities was $26 million during 2011. During 2011, the Company repaid certain debt obligations, including $1.65 billion of Sprint Capital Corporation 7.625% senior notes, the early redemption of $2.0 billion of Sprint Capital Corporation 8.375% senior notes and repayment of $250 million of the $750 million Export Development Canada (EDC) Facility. The reductions in debt obligations were offset by proceeds from issuance of $1.0 billion of 11.5% senior notes due 2021 and $3.0 billion of 9% guaranteed notes due 2018 in a private placement in November 2011. We also paid $86 million for debt financing costs associated with our November 2011 debt issuances and fourth quarter credit facility amendments.Net cash used in financing activities was $905 million during 2010. Activities in 2010 included a $750 million debt payment in June 2010 and a $51 million payment for debt financing costs associated with our new revolving credit facility. In addition, in the fourth quarter 2010, we exercised an option to terminate our relationship with a variable interest entity, which resulted in the repayment of financing, capital lease and other obligations of $105 million.Net cash used in financing activities was $919 million during 2009. Activities in 2009 include debt repayments of $600 million of senior notes in May 2009, the early redemption of $607 million of our convertible senior notes in September 2009, and a $1.0 billion payment on our revolving bank credit facility in November 2009 offset by the issuance of $1.3 billion of senior notes in August 2009.We received $18 million, $8 million and $4 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, in proceeds from common share issuances, primarily resulting from exercises of employee options.Liquidity As of December 31, 2011, our liquidity, including cash, cash equivalents, short term investments, and available borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility was $6.7 billion. Our cash, cash equivalents and short term investments totaled $5.6 billion as of December 31, 2011 compared to $5.5 billion as of December 31, 2010. As of December 31, 2011, $1.1 billion in letters of credit were outstanding under our $2.2 billion revolving bank credit facility, including the letter of credit required by the Report and Order to reconfigure the 800 MHz band. As a result of the outstanding letters of credit, which directly reduce the availability of the revolving bank credit facility, we had $1.1 billion of borrowing capacity available under our revolving bank credit facility as of December 31, 2011. On January 31, 2011, $1.65 billion of Sprint Capital Corporation 7.625% senior notes were repaid upon maturity. Also in January 2011, we amended $500 million of our $750 million EDC loan to extend the maturity date from 2012 to 2015. In October 2011, we amended the terms of our revolving credit facility to modify certain financial covenants and increase in the capacity by $150 million to $2.2 billion. On November 23, 2011, we paid $250 million plus accrued and unpaid interest of the EDC loan due 2012. In addition, the EDC loan agreement was amended in December 2011 to provide for similar covenant terms to those of the amended revolving bank credit facility. On December 29, 2011, we redeemed all of our outstanding $2.0 billion Sprint Capital Corporation 8.375% senior notes due March 2012 for principal plus accrued and unpaid interest in addition to a $33 million loss recognized as a result of the early retirement. In January 2012, we received a $150 million note receivable with a stated interest rate of 11.5% from Clearwire as a result of the additional investment provided to Clearwire through our amended agreement in the fourth quarter 2011 that matures in two installments of $75 million plus accrued interest in January 2013 and in January 2014.In September 2011, we entered into a four year commitment with Apple, Inc. to purchase a minimum number of smartphones, which on average, are expected to carry a higher subsidy per unit than other smartphones we sell. Our minimum commitment under this arrangement is approximately $15.5 billion; however, we expect our actual purchases will exceed this amount. This will result in an expected increase in cash outflow and reduction in 44Table of Contentsoperating income in the earlier years of the contract until such time as we may recover the acquisition costs through subscriber revenue.Additionally, in October 2011, we announced our intention to accelerate the timeline associated with Network Vision, our network modernization plan. In addition to Network Vision, we are currently experiencing rapid growth in data usage which requires additional capital for data capacity to meet our customers needs and to maintain customer satisfaction. Our accelerated timeline coupled with our capital needs to maintain and operate our existing infrastructure are expected to require approximately $10 billion in total capital expenditures over the two year period ending December 31, 2013. In addition to our expectation of increased capital expenditures, we also expect network operating expenditures to increase during the deployment period. To meet our short and long term liquidity requirements, we look to a variety of funding sources. Our existing liquidity balance and cash generated from operating activities is our primary source of funding. In addition to cash flows from operating activities, we rely on the borrowing capacity available under our credit facility, the ability to issue debt and equity securities, and other forms of financing to support our short and long term liquidity requirements. In November 2011, Sprint Nextel Corporation issued $1.0 billion of 11.5% senior notes due 2021 and $3.0 billion of 9% guaranteed notes due 2018. We believe these issuances, in addition to our existing available liquidity and cash flows from operations, will be sufficient to meet our funding requirements through at least 2012 including debt service requirements, and other significant future contractual obligations. To maintain an adequate amount of available liquidity and execute according to the timeline of our current business plan, which includes Network Vision, subscriber growth and the expected achievement of a cost structure intended to achieve more competitive margins, we expect we will need to raise additional funds from external resources of approximately $1.0 billion to $3.0 billion through 2013, dependent, in part, on our ability to maintain adequate cash balances and the ongoing availability of our existing unutilized borrowing capacity under our existing credit facilities. If we are unable to fund our remaining capital needs from external resources on terms acceptable to us, we would need to modify our existing business plan, which could adversely affect our expectation of long term benefits to results from operations and cash flows from operations. In determining our expectation of future funding needs in the next 12 months and beyond, we have considered: projected revenues and expenses relating to our operations; anticipated levels and timing of capital expenditures, including the capacity and upgrading of our networks and the deployment of new technologies in our networks, and FCC license acquisitions; anticipated payments under the Report and Order, as supplemented; any additional contributions we may make to our pension plan; scheduled debt service requirements; additional investments, if any, we may choose to make in Clearwire; andother future contractual obligations and general corporate expenditures.As of December 31, 2011, we had working capital of $3.8 billion compared to $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2010. The increase in working capital is primarily due to the net cash proceeds of approximately $3.9 billion from the issuance of notes, increases in device and accessory inventory, and decreases in the current portion of long term debt related to the repayment of $1.65 billion of Sprint Capital Corporation 7.625% senior notes due January 2011. The remaining change is primarily related to other activity in current assets during 2011.Capital ResourcesOur ability to fund our capital needs from external sources is ultimately affected by the overall capacity and terms of the banking and securities markets, as well as our performance and our credit ratings. Given our recent financial performance as well as the volatility in these markets, we continue to monitor them closely and to take steps to maintain financial flexibility and a reasonable cost of capital.As of December 31, 2011, Moodys Investor Service, Standard & Poors Ratings Services, and Fitch Ratings had assigned the following credit ratings to certain of our outstanding obligations: 45Table of Contents Rating Rating Agency Issuer Rating Unsecured Notes Guaranteed Notes CreditFacility OutlookMoodys B1 B3 Ba3 Ba1 Review for DowngradeStandard and Poors B+ B+ BB NegativeFitch B+ B+ BB BB NegativeDowngrades of our current ratings do not accelerate scheduled principal payments of our existing debt. However, downgrades may cause us to incur higher interest costs on our credit facilities and future borrowings, if any, and could negatively impact our access to the public capital markets.The terms and conditions of our revolving bank credit facility require the ratio of total indebtedness to trailing four quarters earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization and certain other non recurring items, as defined by the credit facility (adjusted EBITDA), to be no more than 4.5 to 1.0. In October 2011, our credit facility was amended to prospectively redefine adjusted EBITDA to exclude costs comprising equipment net subsidy, as defined by the amended agreement, to the extent such costs exceed $1.1 billion in any of the six consecutive fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2013. The amount added back related to this exclusion cannot exceed $1.75 billion in any four consecutive fiscal quarters and is limited to $2.7 billion in the aggregate for the six consecutive fiscal quarters ending March 31, 2013. After March 31, 2012, the ratio will be reduced to 4.25 to 1.0, and further reduced to 4.0 to 1.0 after December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the ratio was 3.7 to 1.0. Under this revolving bank credit facility, we are currently restricted from paying cash dividends because our ratio of total indebtedness to adjusted EBITDA exceeds 2.5 to 1.0. The terms of our amended revolving bank credit facility provide for an interest rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), plus a margin of between 2.75% to 4.0% beginning in October 2011. Certain of our domestic subsidiaries have guaranteed the revolving bank credit facility. A default under our borrowings could trigger defaults under our other debt obligations, which in turn could result in the maturities being accelerated. Certain indentures that govern our outstanding notes also require compliance with various covenants, including limitations on the incurrence of indebtedness and liens by the Company and its subsidiaries, as defined by the terms of the indentures. Certain of our indentures also contain covenants that limit the Companys ability to sell all or substantially all of its assets or to merge or consolidate with or into other companies.We expect to remain in compliance with our covenants through at least the end of 2012, although there can be no assurance that we will do so. Although we expect to improve our subscriber results, and execute on our Network Vision plans, including the decommissioning of the Nextel platform, if we do not meet our plan, depending on the severity of any difference in actual results versus what we currently anticipate, it is possible that we would not remain in compliance with our covenants or be able to meet our debt service obligations, which could result in acceleration of our indebtedness. If such unforeseen events occur, we may engage with our lenders to obtain appropriate waivers or amendments of our credit facilities or refinance borrowings, although there is no assurance we would be successful in any of these actions. CURRENT BUSINESS OUTLOOK We endeavor to both retain our existing and add new wireless subscribers in order to reverse the net loss in postpaid wireless subscribers that we have experienced. We expect to improve our subscriber trends by continuing to improve the customer experience by enhancing our network, providing diversity of devices, and through offers which provide value, simplicity and productivity. Given the current economic environment, the difficulties the economic uncertainties create in forecasting, as well as the inherent uncertainties in predicting future customer behavior, we are unable to forecast with assurance the net retail postpaid subscriber results we will experience during 2012 or thereafter. However, the Company expects 2012 Consolidated segment earnings to be between $3.7 billion and $3.9 billion, including the estimated impact of the iPhone and the effects of Network Vision. We expect total net service revenue growth of approximately 4% to 6%. The Company also expects full year capital expenditures in 2012, excluding capitalized interest, to be approximately $6 billion. The above discussion is subject to the risks and other cautionary and qualifying factors set forth under Forward Looking Statements and Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors in this report. 46Table of ContentsFUTURE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS The following table sets forth our best estimates as to the amounts and timing of contractual payments as of December 31, 2011. Future events, including additional purchases of our securities and refinancing of those securities, could cause actual payments to differ significantly from these amounts. See Forward Looking Statements. Future Contractual Obligations Total 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 andthereafter (in millions)Notes, bank credit facilities and debentures(1) $32,496 $1,476 $3,238 $2,672 $3,930 $3,097 $18,083Capital leases and financing obligation(2) 1,759 95 95 87 88 90 1,304Operating leases(3) 18,140 1,891 1,922 1,881 1,725 1,573 9,148Purchase orders and other commitments(4) 29,505 11,075 6,240 5,657 4,896 716 921Total $81,900 $14,537 $11,495 $10,297 $10,639 $5,476 $29,456 (1)Includes principal and estimated interest payments. Interest payments are based on managements expectations for future interest rates.(2)Represents capital lease payments including interest and financing obligation related to the sale and subsequent leaseback of multiple tower sites. (3)Includes future lease costs related to cell and switch sites, real estate, network equipment and office space. (4)Includes service, spectrum, network capacity and other executory contracts. Excludes blanket purchase orders in the amount of $24 million. See below for further discussion. Purchase orders and other commitments include minimum purchases we commit to purchase from suppliers over time and or the unconditional purchase obligations where we guarantee to make a minimum payment to suppliers for goods and services regardless of whether we take delivery. These amounts do not represent our entire anticipated purchases in the future, but generally represent only our estimate of those items for which we are committed. Our estimates are based on assumptions about the variable components of the contracts such as hours contracted, number of subscribers, pricing, and other factors. In addition, we are party to various arrangements that are conditional in nature and create an obligation to make payments only upon the occurrence of certain events, such as the delivery of functioning software or products. Because it is not possible to predict the timing or amounts that may be due under these conditional arrangements, no such amounts have been included in the table above. The table above also excludes approximately $24 million of blanket purchase order amounts since their agreement terms are not specified. No time frame is set for these purchase orders and they are not legally binding. As a result, they are not firm commitments. Our liability for uncertain tax positions was $225 million as of December 31, 2011. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the timing of the resolution of the underlying tax positions, it is not practicable to assign this liability to any particular year(s) in the table. The table above does not include remaining costs to be paid in connection with the fulfillment of our obligations under the Report and Order. The Report and Order requires us to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury at the conclusion of the band reconfiguration process to the extent that the value of the 1.9 GHz spectrum we received exceeds the total of the value of licenses for spectrum in the 700 MHz and 800 MHz bands that we surrendered under the decision plus the actual costs, or qualifying costs, that we incur to retune incumbents and our own facilities. From the inception of the program through December 31, 2011, we have incurred approximately $3.1 billion of costs directly attributable to the spectrum reconfiguration program. This amount does not include any of our internal network costs that we have preliminarily allocated to the reconfiguration program for capacity sites and modifications for which we may request credit under the reconfiguration program. We estimate, based on our experience to date with the reconfiguration program and on information currently available, that our total direct costs attributable to complete the spectrum reconfigurations will range between $3.6 and $3.7 billion. Accordingly, we believe that it is unlikely that we will be required to make a payment to the U.S. Treasury. 47Table of ContentsOFF BALANCE SHEET FINANCING We do not participate in, or secure, financings for any unconsolidated, special purpose entities. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Sprint applies those accounting policies that management believes best reflect the underlying business and economic events, consistent with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. Sprints more critical accounting policies include those related to the basis of presentation, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation and recoverability of our equity method investment in Clearwire, valuation and recoverability of long lived assets, and evaluation of goodwill and indefinite lived assets for impairment. Inherent in such policies are certain key assumptions and estimates made by management. Management regularly updates its estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements based on its latest assessment of the current and projected business and general economic environment. These critical accounting policies have been discussed with Sprints Board of Directors. Sprints significant accounting policies are summarized in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Basis of Presentation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Sprint and its consolidated subsidiaries. Investments where Sprint maintains majority ownership, but lacks full decision making ability over all major issues, are accounted for using the equity method. Governance for Sprints major unconsolidated investment, Clearwire, is based on Clearwire board representation for which Sprint does not have a majority vote. Allowance for Doubtful Accounts We maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses that result from failure of our subscribers to make required payments. Our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts considers a number of factors, including collection experience, aging of the accounts receivable portfolios, credit quality of the subscriber base, and other qualitative considerations. To the extent that actual loss experience differs significantly from historical trends, the required allowance amounts could differ from our estimate. A 10% change in the amount estimated to be uncollectible would result in a corresponding change in bad debt expense of approximately $21 million for the Wireless segment and $1 million for the Wireline segment. Valuation and Recoverability of our Equity Method Investment in Clearwire We assess our equity method investment for other than temporary impairment when indicators such as decline in quoted prices in active markets indicate a value below the carrying value of our investment. This evaluation requires significant judgment regarding, but not limited to, the severity and duration of decline in market prices; the ability and intent to hold the securities until recovery; financial condition, liquidity, and near term prospects of the investee, specific events, and other factors. At each financial reporting measurement date, we evaluate the excess, if any, of Sprints carrying value over the estimated fair value of our investment in Clearwire to determine if such excess, an implied unrealized loss, is other than temporary. Our evaluation considers, among other things, Clearwires market capitalization, volatility associated with Clearwires common stock, and the duration of a decline in Clearwires average trading stock price below Sprints carrying value. Our evaluation also considers tax benefits associated with our Class B non voting common interests in Clearwire Communications LLC, governance rights, our expectation of the duration of our ongoing relationship, as well as other factors. Based on our evaluation as of December 31, 2011, we recognized a non cash impairment of our investment in Clearwire of $135 million in the fourth quarter 2011. The carrying value of our equity method investment in Clearwire as of December 31, 2011 totaled approximately $1.7 billion.Valuation and Recoverability of Long lived Assets Long lived assets consist primarily of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization. Changes in technology or in our intended use of these assets, as well as changes in economic or industry factors or in our business or prospects, may cause the estimated period of use or the value of these assets to change. 48Table of ContentsProperty, plant and equipment are generally depreciated on a straight line basis over estimated economic useful lives. Certain network assets are depreciated using the group life method. Depreciable life studies are performed periodically to confirm the appropriateness of depreciable lives for certain categories of property, plant and equipment. These studies take into account actual usage, physical wear and tear, replacement history and assumptions about technology evolution. When these factors indicate that an assets useful life is different from the previous assessment, we depreciate the remaining book values prospectively over the adjusted remaining estimated useful life. Depreciation rates for assets using the group life method are revised periodically as required under this method. Changes made as a result of depreciable life studies and rate changes generally do not have a material effect on depreciation expense. Long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Long lived asset groups were determined based upon certain factors including assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities. If the total of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of our assets, a loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value of the assets. Impairment analyses, when performed, are based on our current business and technology strategy, views of growth rates for our business, anticipated future economic and regulatory conditions and expected technological availability. Our estimate of undiscounted cash flows exceeded the carrying value of these assets by more than 10%. If we continue to have operational challenges, including retaining and attracting subscribers, future cash flows of the Company may not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of our wireless asset group, and we could record asset impairments that are material to Sprints consolidated results of operations and financial condition. In addition to the analysis described above, certain assets that have not yet been deployed in the business, including network equipment, cell site development costs and software in development, are periodically assessed to determine recoverability. Network equipment and cell site development costs are expensed whenever events or changes in circumstances cause the Company to conclude the assets are no longer needed to meet managements strategic network plans and will not be deployed. Software development costs are expensed when it is no longer probable that the software project will be deployed. Network equipment that has been removed from the network is also periodically assessed to determine recoverability. In connection with Network Vision, including the decommissioning of the Nextel platform, management may conclude in future periods that certain equipment will never be either deployed or redeployed, in which case non cash charges that could be material to our consolidated financial statements would be recognized. Refer to Results of Operations for additional information on asset impairments. Evaluation of Goodwill and Indefinite Lived Intangible Assets for Impairment Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price paid over the fair value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of acquired businesses. Sprint evaluates the carrying value of goodwill annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may exceed estimated fair value. Our analysis includes a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill applies to the carrying value, including goodwill, of that reporting unit. We regularly assess whether any indicators of impairment exist, which requires a significant amount of judgment. Such indicators may include a sustained significant decline in our share price and market capitalization; a decline in our expected future cash flows; a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate; unanticipated competition; the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit; and or slower growth rates, among others. Any adverse change in these factors could result in an impairment up to the carrying value of our goodwill, which was $359 million as of December 31, 2011. The Company recognizes that our market capitalization, the product of our traded stock price, and shares outstanding, is subject to volatility and, during certain periods, has been below our shareholders equity book value. Accordingly we monitor changes in our market capitalization between annual impairment tests to determine whether declines, if any, should necessitate an interim review of goodwill for impairment. We consider a decline in our market capitalization that corresponds to an overall deterioration in stock market conditions to be less of an indicator of goodwill impairment than a unilateral decline in our market capitalization, which could result from adverse changes in our underlying operating performance, cash flows, financial condition and or liquidity. In the event that our market capitalization does decline below its book value, we consider the length and severity of the decline and 49Table of Contentsthe reasons for the decline when assessing whether a potential goodwill impairment exists. We believe that short term fluctuations in share price may not necessarily reflect underlying aggregate fair value of our segments, which are our reporting units. We also believe that the market price of our stock may not be representative of the fair value of our overall business since it does not include a control premium that a market participant may be willing to pay for the ability to take advantage of synergies and other benefits that could be derived from control of the Company. However, if a decline in our market capitalization below book value persists for an extended period of time, we would likely consider the decline to be indicative of a decline in the estimated fair value at the reporting unit level.Differences in the Companys actual future cash flows, operating results, growth rates, capital expenditures, cost of capital and discount rates as compared to the estimates utilized for the purpose of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit, as well as a decline in the Companys stock price and related market capitalization, could affect the results of our annual goodwill assessment and, accordingly, potentially lead to a future goodwill impairment.The determination of the estimated fair value of the wireless reporting unit requires significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions primarily include, but are not limited to, transactions within the wireless industry and related control premiums, discount rate, terminal growth rates, operating income before depreciation and amortization (OIBDA) and capital expenditures forecasts. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making those estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. The merits of each significant assumption, both individually and in the aggregate, used to estimate the fair value of a reporting unit are evaluated for reasonableness. A decline in the estimated fair value of our wireless reporting unit of 10% would not result in an impairment of our goodwill.FCC licenses and our Sprint and Boost Mobile trademarks have been identified as indefinite lived intangible assets, in addition to goodwill, after considering the expected use of the assets, the regulatory and economic environment within which they are being used, and the effects of obsolescence on their use. When required, Sprint assesses the recoverability of other indefinite lived intangibles, including FCC licenses which are carried as a single unit of accounting. In assessing recoverability of FCC licenses, we estimate the fair value of such licenses using the Greenfield direct value method, which approximates value through estimating the discounted future cash flows of a hypothetical start up business. Assumptions key in estimating fair value under this method include, but are not limited to, capital expenditures, subscriber activations and deactivations, market share achieved, tax rates in effect and discount rate. A one percent decline in our assumed revenue growth rate used to estimate terminal value, a one percent decline in our assumed net cash flows or a one percent adverse change in any of the key assumptions referred to above would not result in an impairment of our FCC licenses as of the most recent testing date. A decline in the estimated fair value of FCC licenses of approximately 10% also would not result in an impairment of the carrying value. NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In September 2009, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) modified the accounting for Multiple Deliverable Revenue Arrangements and Certain Revenue Arrangements that Include Software Elements. These modifications alter the methods previously required for allocating consideration received in multiple element arrangements to require revenue allocation based on a relative selling price method, including arrangements containing software components and non software components that function together to deliver the products essential functionality. These modifications were effective beginning in the first quarter 2011 and did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In July 2010, the FASB amended the requirements for Disclosures about the Credit Quality of Financing Receivables and the Allowance for Credit Losses. As a result of these amendments, an entity is required to disaggregate by portfolio segment or class certain existing disclosures and provide certain new disclosures about its financing receivables and related allowance for credit losses. The new disclosures as of the end of the reporting period are effective for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2010, while the disclosures about activity that occurs during a reporting period were effective for the first quarter 2011, neither of which had a material effect on our consolidated financial statements. In May 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding Fair Value Measurement: Amendments to Achieve Common Fair Value Measurement and Disclosure Requirements in U.S. GAAP and IFRSs, which resulted in common requirements for measuring fair value and for disclosing information about fair value measurement 50Table of Contentsunder both U.S. GAAP and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), including a consistent definition of the term "fair value." The amendments will be effective beginning in the first quarter 2012; however, we do not expect the effects to be material. The FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding Comprehensive Income: Presentation of Comprehensive Income in June 2011, which was subsequently revised in December 2011, that amends existing guidance to present the total of comprehensive income, the components of net income and the components of other comprehensive income, in either one continuous statement of comprehensive income or in two consecutive financial statements. The guidance eliminates the option to present the components of other comprehensive income in the statement of changes in shareholders equity. The amendments will be effective beginning in the first quarter 2012, with early adoption permitted, require retrospective application, and will only effect presentation of information in our primary financial statements. We early adopted the new presentation requirements which resulted in reporting the components of comprehensive income (loss) in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Loss, rather than in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders Equity, as previously reported.In September 2011, the FASB issued authoritative guidance regarding Testing Goodwill for Impairment which is intended to reduce the cost and complexity of the annual goodwill impairment test by providing entities with the option of performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. The revised standard will be effective for annual and interim goodwill impairment tests performed beginning in the first quarter 2012, with early adoption permitted under certain circumstances. We early adopted the provisions of this standard as part of our annual assessment of goodwill with no effect on our financial statements.FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS We include certain estimates, projections and other forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in our annual, quarterly and current reports, and in other publicly available material. Statements regarding expectations, including performance assumptions and estimates relating to capital requirements, as well as other statements that are not historical facts, are forward looking statements. These statements reflect managements judgments based on currently available information and involve a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements. With respect to these forward looking statements, management has made assumptions regarding, among other things, subscriber and network usage, subscriber growth and retention, pricing, operating costs, the timing of various events and the economic and regulatory environment. Future performance cannot be assured. Actual results may differ materially from those in the forward looking statements. Some factors that could cause actual results to differ include: our ability to retain and attract subscribers;the ability of our competitors to offer products and services at lower prices due to lower cost structures;the effects of vigorous competition on a highly penetrated market, including the impact of competition on the price we are able to charge subscribers for services and equipment we provide and our ability to retain existing subscribers and attract new subscribers; the impact of equipment net subsidy costs; the impact of increased purchase commitments; the overall demand for our service offerings, including the impact of decisions of new or existing subscribers between our postpaid and prepaid services offerings and between our two network platforms; and the impact of new, emerging and competing technologies on our business;the ability to generate sufficient cash flow to fully implement our network modernization plan, Network Vision, to improve and enhance our networks and service offerings, improve our operating margins, implement our business strategies and provide competitive new technologies;the effective implementation of Network Vision, including timing, execution, technologies, and costs;our ability to migrate subscribers off the Nextel platform and mitigate related increases in churn;our ability to access additional spectrum, including through spectrum hosting arrangements;51Table of Contentschanges in available technology and the effects of such changes, including product substitutions and deployment costs;our ability to obtain additional financing on terms acceptable to us, or at all; volatility in the trading price of our common stock, current economic conditions and our ability to access capital;the impact of unrelated parties not meeting our business requirements, including a significant adverse change in the ability or willingness of such parties to provide devices or infrastructure equipment for our networks;the costs and business risks associated with providing new services and entering new geographic markets; the financial performance of Clearwire and its ability to build, operate, and maintain its 4G network, including an LTE network;our ability to access Clearwires spectrum;the compatibility of Sprints LTE network with Clearwires LTE network;the effects of mergers and consolidations and new entrants in the communications industry and unexpected announcements or developments from others in the communications industry; unexpected results of litigation filed against us or our suppliers or vendors;the impact of adverse network performance;the costs or potential customer impacts of compliance with regulatory mandates including, but not limited to, compliance with the FCCs Report and Order to reconfigure the 800 MHz band;equipment failure, natural disasters, terrorist acts or other breaches of network or information technology security;one or more of the markets in which we compete being impacted by changes in political, economic or other factors such as monetary policy, legal and regulatory changes, or other external factors over which we have no control; andother risks referenced from time to time in this report, including in Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors and other filings of ours with the SEC.The words may, could, "should," estimate, project, forecast, intend, expect, "anticipate," believe, target, plan, providing guidance and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements. Forward looking statements are found throughout this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and elsewhere in this report. Readers are cautioned that other factors, although not listed above, could also materially affect our future performance and operating results. The reader should not place undue reliance on forward looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report. We are not obligated to publicly release any revisions to forward looking statements to reflect events after the date of this report, including unforeseen events. FINANCIAL STRATEGIES General Risk Management Policies Our board of directors has adopted a financial risk management policy that authorizes us to enter into derivative transactions, and all transactions comply with the policy. We do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes with the exception of equity rights obtained in connection with commercial agreements or strategic investments, usually in the form of warrants to purchase common shares. Derivative instruments are primarily used for hedging and risk management purposes. Hedging activities may be done for various purposes, including, but not limited to, mitigating the risks associated with an asset, liability, committed transaction or probable forecasted transaction. We seek to minimize counterparty credit risk through stringent credit approval and review processes, credit support agreements, continual review and monitoring of all counterparties, and thorough legal review of contracts. Exposure to market risk is controlled by regularly monitoring changes in hedge positions under normal and stress conditions to ensure they do not exceed established limits.52Table of ContentsItem 7A.Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk We are primarily exposed to the market risk associated with unfavorable movements in interest rates, foreign currencies, and equity prices. The risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments and positions is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in those factors. Interest Rate Risk The communications industry is a capital intensive, technology driven business. We are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our borrowings. Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows. Specific interest rate risk includes: the risk of increasing interest rates on floating rate debt and the risk of increasing interest rates for planned new fixed rate long term financings or refinancings. About 95% of our debt as of December 31, 2011 was fixed rate debt. While changes in interest rates impact the fair value of this debt, there is no impact to earnings and cash flows because we intend to hold these obligations to maturity unless market and other conditions are favorable. We perform interest rate sensitivity analyses on our variable rate debt. These analyses indicate that a one percentage point change in interest rates would have an annual pre tax impact of $10 million on our consolidated statements of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2011. We also perform a sensitivity analysis on the fair market value of our outstanding debt. A 10% decline in market interest rates would cause a $927 million increase in the fair market value of our debt to $19.2 billion. Foreign Currency Risk We also enter into forward contracts and options in foreign currencies to reduce the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates. Our foreign exchange risk management program focuses on reducing transaction exposure to optimize consolidated cash flow. We use foreign currency derivatives to hedge our foreign currency exposure related to settlement of international telecommunications access charges and the operation of our international subsidiaries. The dollar equivalent of our net foreign currency payables from international settlements was $8 million and the net foreign currency receivables from international operations was less than $1 million as of December 31, 2011. The potential immediate pre tax loss to us that would result from a hypothetical 10% change in foreign currency exchange rates based on these positions would be insignificant. Equity Risk We are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments. We invest in equity instruments of public companies for operational and strategic business purposes. These securities are subject to significant fluctuations in fair market value due to volatility of the stock market and industries in which the companies operate. These securities, which are classified in investments on the consolidated balance sheets, primarily include equity method investments, such as our investment in Clearwire and available for sale securities. In certain business transactions, we are granted warrants to purchase the securities of other companies at fixed rates. These warrants are supplemental to the terms of the business transaction and are not designated as hedging instruments.
