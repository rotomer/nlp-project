Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Starbucks Corporations fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. The fiscal year ended on October 3, 2004, included 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in the fiscal fourth quarter. Fiscal years 2003 and 2002 each had 52 weeks. Fiscal year 2005 will have 52 weeks. Restatement of Financial Statements On February 7, 2005, the Office of the Chief Accountant of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a letter to the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants expressing its views regarding certain operating lease related accounting issues and their application under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America (GAAP). In light of this letter, the Companys management initiated a review of its lease accounting and determined that its then current method of accounting for leasehold improvements funded by landlord incentives or allowances under operating leases (tenant improvement allowances) and its then current method of accounting for rent holidays were not in accordance with GAAP. As a result, the Company restated its consolidated financial statements for each of the fiscal years ended October 3, 2004, September 28, 2003, and September 29, 2002, in this Report. The Company had historically accounted for tenant improvement allowances as reductions to the related leasehold improvement asset on the consolidated balance sheets and capital expenditures in investing activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Management determined that Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Technical Bulletin No. 88 1, Issues Relating to Accounting for Leases, requires these allowances to be recorded as deferred rent liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and as a component of operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows. Additionally, this adjustment results in a reclassification of the deferred rent amortization from Depreciation and amortization expenses to Cost of sales including occupancy costs on the consolidated statements of earnings. The Company had historically recognized rent holiday periods on a straight line basis over the lease term commencing with the initial occupancy date, or the opening date for Company operated retail stores. The store opening date coincided with the commencement of business operations, which corresponds to the intended use of the property. Management re evaluated FASB Technical Bulletin No. 85 3, Accounting for Operating Leases with Scheduled Rent Increases, and determined that the lease term should commence on the date the Company takes possession of the leased space for construction purposes, which is generally two months prior to a store opening date. Excluding tax impacts, the correction of this accounting requires the Company to record additional deferred rent in Accrued occupancy costs and Other long term liabilities and to adjust Retained earnings on the consolidated balance sheets as well as to correct amortization in Costs of sales including occupancy costs on the consolidated statements of earnings for each of the three years in the period ended October 3, 2004. The cumulative effect of these accounting changes is a reduction to retained earnings of $8.6 million as of the beginning of fiscal 2002 and decreases to retained earnings of $1.3 million, $1.5 million and $1.2 million for the fiscal years ended 2002, 2003 and 2004, respectively. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements of this Report for a summary of the effects of these changes on the Companys consolidated balance sheets as of October 3, 2004, and September 28, 2003, as well as on the Companys consolidated statements of earnings and cash flows for fiscal years 2004, 2003 and 2002. The accompanying Managements Discussion and Analysis gives effect to these corrections. Management Overview During the fiscal year ended October 3, 2004, all areas of Starbucks business, from U.S. and international Company operated 15 Table of Contents retail operations to the Companys specialty businesses, delivered strong financial performance, and innovation was prevalent throughout the Companys operations. Starbucks believes the Companys ability to achieve the balance between growing the core business and building the foundation for future growth is the key to increasing shareholder value. Starbucks fiscal 2004 performance provides a strong example of the Companys commitment to achieve this balance. Historically, the primary driver of the Companys revenue growth has been the opening of new retail stores, both Company operated and licensed, in pursuit of the Companys objective to establish Starbucks as the most recognized and respected brand in the world. With a presence today in more than 30 countries, management believes that the Companys long term goal of operating 15,000 Starbucks retail locations throughout the United States and at least 15,000 stores in International markets is achievable. In addition to opening new retail stores, Starbucks is targeting to increase revenues generated at new and existing Company operated stores by attracting new customers and increasing the frequency of visits by current customers. The strategy is to increase first year average store sales and comparable store sales by continuously improving the level of customer service, maintaining a steady stream of product innovation and improving the speed of service through training, technology and process improvement. For U.S. Company operated stores opened in fiscal 2004, first year sales volumes are currently estimated at greater than $800,000 as a result of these efforts. Comparable store sales for Company operated markets increased by 10%, making fiscal 2004 the 13th consecutive year with comparable store sales growth of 5% or greater. In licensed retail operations, Starbucks shares operating and store development experience to help licensees improve the profitability of existing stores and build new stores, which generate additional royalty income and product sales. The Companys strategy is to selectively increase its equity stake as International markets develop. The combination of more retail stores, higher revenues from existing stores, and growth in other business channels in both the United States and International operating segments resulted in a 29.9% increase in total net revenues for the 53 weeks of fiscal 2004, compared to the 52 weeks of fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, total net revenues increased 27.3%. Both of these revenue growth measures were above the Companys three to five year target of approximately 20%. Since additional retail stores can leverage existing support organizations and facilities, the Companys infrastructure can be expanded more slowly than the rate of revenue growth and generate margin improvement. In fiscal 2004, operating income as a percentage of total net revenues increased to 11.5% from 10.4% in fiscal 2003, and net earnings increased by 46.4%, compared to fiscal 2003. These results demonstrated the Companys ability to improve operating margin despite pressures from rising dairy and green coffee commodity costs throughout the fiscal year. The Companys International operations delivered a full year of positive operating results, primarily due to leverage gained on most operating expenses distributed over an expanded revenue base. In recent fiscal years, the Company made substantial infrastructure investments in corporate and regional support facilities and personnel, as well as established more efficient distribution networks. Such investments were necessary to support the Companys planned international expansion, which is now realizing substantial benefit from this foundation. Management believes that comparable store sales growth of the level achieved during fiscal 2004 is not sustainable over the long term. However, management believes that new store development opportunities on a global basis are sufficient for the Company to maintain a high level of unit growth and that the execution of the current retail operating strategy can continue to increase first year average store sales and comparable stores sales. These revenue growth opportunities, coupled with continuous focus on controlling both operating and capital costs, should allow Starbucks to continue to modestly improve margins and achieve annual revenue growth of approximately 20% and annual earnings per share growth of 20% 25% for the next three to five years. Acquisitions In July 2004, Starbucks acquired 100% of its licensed operations in Singapore and acquired 49.9% of its licensed operations in Malaysia, for a combined total of approximately $12.1 million. Previously, the Company did not have any equity ownership interests in these entities. The results of operations for Singapore are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. For its investment in Malaysia, management applied the equity method of accounting from the date of acquisition, since the Company is able to exert significant influence over the investees operating and financial policies. In July 2003, the Company acquired Seattle Coffee Company (SCC), which includes the Seattles Best Coffee and Torrefazione Italia brands, from AFC Enterprises, Inc. for $70 million in cash. The results of operations of SCC are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. 16 Table of Contents During fiscal 2003, Starbucks increased its equity ownership to 50% of its international licensed operations in Austria, Shanghai, Spain, Switzerland and Taiwan, which enabled the Company to exert significant influence over their operating and financial policies. For these operations, the Company reflected a change in accounting method during fiscal 2003, from the cost method to the equity method, in the consolidated financial statements. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 The following table sets forth the percentage relationship to total net revenues, unless otherwise indicated, of certain items included in the Companys consolidated statements of earnings, as restated: Oct 3, 2004 Sept 28, 2003 Sept 29, 2002 Fiscal year ended (53 Wks) (52 Wks) (52 Wks) STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS DATA Net revenues: Company operated retail 84.2 % 84.6 % 84.9 % Specialty: Licensing 10.7 10.1 9.5 Foodservice and other 5.1 5.3 5.6 Total specialty 15.8 15.4 15.1 Total net revenues 100.0 100.0 100.0 Cost of sales including occupancy costs 41.4 41.3 41.0 Store operating expenses (1) 40.2 40.0 39.7 Other operating expenses (2) 20.5 22.6 21.4 Depreciation and amortization expenses 5.5 6.0 6.4 General and administrative expenses 5.7 6.0 7.1 Income from equity investees 1.1 0.9 1.0 Operating income 11.5 10.4 9.6 Interest and other income, net 0.3 0.2 0.2 Gain on sale of investment 0.0 0.0 0.4 Earnings before income taxes 11.8 10.6 10.2 Income taxes 4.4 4.1 3.8 Net earnings 7.4 % 6.5 % 6.4 % (1) Shown as a percentage of related Company operated retail revenues. (2) Shown as a percentage of related total specialty revenues. Consolidated Results of Operations Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2004 increased 29.9% to $5.3 billion from $4.1 billion for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. Net revenues increased 27.3% when calculated on a comparative 52 week basis for both fiscal 2004 and 2003. During the fiscal year ended 2004, Starbucks derived 84% of total net revenues from its Company operated retail stores. Company operated retail revenues increased 29.2% to $4.5 billion for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $3.4 billion for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. Company operated retail revenues increased 26.7% when calculated on a comparative 52 week basis for both fiscal 2004 and 2003. This increase was primarily due to the opening of 634 new Company operated retail stores during the previous 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 10%. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 9% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 1% increase in the average value per transaction. Comparable store sales growth percentages were calculated excluding the extra week of fiscal 2004. Management believes increased customer traffic continues to be driven by new product innovation, continued popularity of core products, a high level of customer satisfaction and improved speed of service through enhanced technology, training and execution at retail stores. The Company derived the remaining 16% of total net revenues from its Specialty Operations. Specialty revenues, which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other revenues, increased 33.7% to $837 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $626 million for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, total specialty revenues increased 31.0% to $820 million. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements, grocery and warehouse club licensing, and certain other branded product licensed operations, increased 38.2% to $566 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $410 million for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. The increase was due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the addition of 710 new licensed retail stores during the previous 12 months and growth in the grocery and warehouse club businesses. The growth in the grocery and warehouse club businesses was a result of expanded agreements with Kraft Foods, Inc., including the addition of six new Starbucks coffees along with a selection of Tazo teas, and the acquisition of Seattle Coffee Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. 17 Table of Contents Foodservice and other revenues increased 25.3% to $271 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $216 million for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to the growth in new and existing foodservice accounts, which benefited from the July 2003 acquisition of Seattle Coffee Company. Cost of sales including occupancy costs increased to 41.4% of total net revenues in fiscal 2004, from 41.3% in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to higher dairy and green coffee commodity costs, partially offset by leverage gained on occupancy costs, which are primarily fixed expenses. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company operated retail revenues increased to 40.2% in fiscal 2004, from 40.0% in fiscal 2003, primarily due to higher marketing expenditures for holiday and new product promotions, as well as increased costs to maintain retail stores and equipment due to sustained high traffic levels. Other operating expenses (expenses associated with the Companys Specialty Operations) decreased to 20.5% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2004, compared to 22.6% in fiscal 2003. The decrease was primarily due to leverage gained on payroll related expenditures distributed over an expanded revenue base. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $289 million in fiscal 2004, from $245 million in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to a net increase of 634 new Company operated retail stores during the previous 12 months and higher depreciation expenses associated with shortened estimated useful lives of equipment deployed in the Companys foodservice operations. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.5% for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004, from 6.0% for the corresponding 52 week fiscal 2003 period, primarily due to the leverage of fixed depreciation expenses from the extra sales week in 2004. General and administrative expenses increased to $304 million in fiscal 2004, compared to $245 million in fiscal 2003, primarily due to higher payroll related expenditures. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.7% for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004, from 6.0% for the 52 weeks ended September 28, 2003. Operating income increased 44.0% to $608 million in fiscal 2004, from $422 million in fiscal 2003. The operating margin increased to 11.5% of total net revenues in fiscal 2004, compared to 10.4% in fiscal 2003, primarily due to leverage gained on most fixed operating costs distributed over an expanded revenue base, partially offset by higher dairy and green coffee commodity costs. Income from equity investees was $61 million in fiscal 2004, compared to $38 million in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to volume driven operating results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces bottled Frappuccino and Starbucks DoubleShot coffee drinks, and improved profitability of Starbucks Coffee Japan, Ltd. (Starbucks Japan). The July 2003 increase in the Companys ownership interest from 5% to 50% in the Taiwan and Shanghai licensed operations also contributed to the growth. Net interest and other income, which primarily consists of interest income, increased to $14 million in fiscal 2004, from $12 million in fiscal 2003. The growth was a result of interest income earned on higher cash and liquid investment balances during fiscal 2004, compared to the prior year. Income taxes for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004, resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.2%, compared to 38.5% in fiscal 2003. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to improved operating results as fewer nondeductible losses were generated from international markets, which are in various phases of development. 18 Table of Contents Operating Segments Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the Companys management reviews financial information for operational decision making purposes. The following tables summarize the Companys results of operations by segment for fiscal 2004 and 2003, as restated (in thousands): % of % of % of United Inter Total United States Inter national Unallocated Net 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004 States Revenue national Revenue Corporate Revenue Consolidated Net revenues: Company operated retail $ 3,800,367 84.6 % $ 657,011 81.8 % $ % $ 4,457,378 Specialty: Licensing 436,981 9.7 128,817 16.0 565,798 Foodservice and other 253,502 5.7 17,569 2.2 271,071 Total specialty 690,483 15.4 146,386 18.2 836,869 Total net revenues 4,490,850 100.0 803,397 100.0 5,294,247 Cost of sales including occupancy costs 1,782,584 39.8 408,856 50.9 2,191,440 Store operating expenses 1,546,871 40.7 (1) 243,297 37.0 (1) 1,790,168 Other operating expenses 144,853 21.0 (2) 26,795 18.3 (2) 171,648 Depreciation and amortization expenses 210,448 4.7 46,196 5.8 32,538 0.6 289,182 General and administrative expenses 80,221 1.8 48,206 6.0 175,866 3.3 304,293 Income from equity investees 37,453 0.8 23,204 2.9 60,657 Operating income/(loss) $ 763,326 17.0 % $ 53,251 6.6 % $ (208,404 ) (3.9) % $ 608,173 % of % of % of United Inter Total United States Inter national Unallocated Net 52 weeks ended September 28, 2003 States Revenue national Revenue Corporate Revenue Consolidated Net revenues: Company operated retail $ 2,965,618 85.4 % $ 484,006 80.3 % $ % $ 3,449,624 Specialty: Licensing 301,175 8.7 108,376 18.0 409,551 Foodservice and other 205,659 5.9 10,688 1.7 216,347 Total specialty 506,834 14.6 119,064 19.7 625,898 Total net revenues 3,472,452 100.0 603,070 100.0 4,075,522 Cost of sales including occupancy costs 1,358,836 39.1 322,598 53.5 1,681,434 Store operating expenses 1,199,020 40.4 (1) 180,554 37.3 (1) 1,379,574 Other operating expenses 119,960 23.7 (2) 21,386 18.0 (2) 141,346 Depreciation and amortization expenses 173,747 5.0 38,818 6.4 32,106 0.8 244,671 General and administrative expenses 45,007 1.3 44,352 7.4 155,191 3.8 244,550 Income from equity investees 28,484 0.8 9,912 1.6 38,396 Operating income/(loss) $ 604,366 17.4 % $ 5,274 0.9 % $ (187,297 ) (4.6) % $ 422,343 (1) Shown as a percentage of related Company operated retail revenues. (2) Shown as a percentage of related total specialty revenues. United States The Companys United States operations (United States) represent 85% of Company operated retail revenues, 83% of total specialty revenues and 85% of total net revenues. United States operations sell coffee and other beverages, whole bean coffees, complementary food, coffee brewing equipment and merchandise primarily through Company operated retail stores. Specialty Operations within the United States include licensed retail stores and other licensing operations, foodservice accounts and other initiatives related to the Companys core businesses. United States total net revenues increased by $1.0 billion, or 29.3%, to $4.5 billion for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to $3.5 billion for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, United States total net revenues increased 26.8% to $4.4 billion. United States Company operated retail revenues increased by $835 million, or 28.1%, to $3.8 billion for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to $3.0 billion for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to the opening of 514 new Company operated retail stores during the previous 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 11%. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 10% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 1% increase in the average value per transaction. Management believes increased customer traffic continues to be driven by new product innovation, continued popularity of core products, a high level of customer satisfaction and improved speed of service through enhanced technology, training and execution at retail stores. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, United States Company operated retail revenues increased 25.7% to $3.7 billion. Total United States specialty revenues increased $184 million, or 36.2%, to $690 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to $507 million in the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, 19 Table of Contents United States specialty revenues increased 33.4% to $676 million. United States licensing revenues increased $136 million, or 45.1%, to $437 million, compared to $301 million for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to volume driven growth in the grocery and warehouse club businesses as a result of expanded agreements with Kraft Foods Inc., including the addition of six new Starbucks coffees along with a selection of Tazo teas. In addition, product sales and royalty revenues increased as a result of opening 417 new licensed retail stores during the previous 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased $48 million, or 23.3%, to $254 million from $206 million in fiscal 2003, due to both the addition of new and existing Starbucks and Seattle Coffee Company foodservice accounts. United States operating income increased by 26.3% to $763 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $604 million for the fiscal year ended 2003. Operating margin decreased to 17.0% of related revenues from 17.4% in the 52 week period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to higher dairy and green coffee commodity costs, as well as higher payroll related expenditures to support the Companys accelerated retail store growth. These increases were partially offset by leverage gained on fixed occupancy costs distributed over an expanded revenue base. International The Companys international operations (International) represent the remaining 15% of Company operated retail revenues, 17% of total specialty revenues and 15% of total net revenues. International sells coffees and other beverages, whole bean coffees, complementary food, coffee brewing equipment and merchandise through Company operated retail stores in Canada, the United Kingdom, Thailand, Australia and Singapore, as well as through retail store licensing operations and foodservice accounts in these and more than 20 other countries. International operations are in various early stages of development and have country specific regulatory requirements that necessitate a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income, than in the United States. International total net revenues increased $200 million, or 33.2%, to $803 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to $603 million for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, International total net revenues increased 30.6%. International Company operated retail revenues increased $173 million, or 35.7%, to $657 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to $484 million for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 120 new Company operated retail stores during the previous 12 months, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against both the British pound sterling and Canadian dollar, and comparable store sales growth of 6%. The increase in comparable store sales resulted from a 5% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 1% increase in the average value per transaction. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, International Company operated retail revenues increased 33.0% to $644 million. Total International specialty revenues increased $27 million, or 22.9%, to $146 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to $119 million for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, International specialty revenues increased 20.6% to $144 million. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 293 new licensed retail stores during the previous 12 months, partially offset by proportionate eliminations of sales to equity investees in which the Company increased its ownership interest in late fiscal 2003. International operating income increased to $53 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to $5 million in the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. Operating margin increased to 6.6% of related revenues from 0.9% in the 52 week period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to leverage gained on most fixed costs distributed over an expanded revenue base. Unallocated Corporate Unallocated corporate expenses pertain to certain functions, such as executive management, accounting, administration, tax, treasury and information technology infrastructure, that support but are not specifically attributable to the Companys operating segments and include related depreciation and amortization expenses. Unallocated corporate expenses increased to $208 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $187 million in the 52 week period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to higher provisions for incentive compensation based on the Companys performance and other payroll related expenditures. Total unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased to 3.9% for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to 4.6% for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL 2003 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2002 Consolidated Results of Operations Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2003 increased 23.9% to $4.1 billion, from $3.3 billion for the corresponding fiscal 2002 period. During the fiscal year ended 2003, Starbucks derived 85% of total net revenues from its Company operated retail stores. Company operated retail revenues increased 23.5% to $3.4 billion for the fiscal year ended 2003, from $2.8 20 Table of Contents billion for the corresponding fiscal 2002 period. This increase was due primarily to the opening of 602 new Company operated retail stores during the previous 12 months, comparable store sales growth of 8% driven almost entirely by increased transactions, and the July 2003 acquisition of 49 Seattles Best Coffee and 21 Torrefazione Italia stores. The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from its Specialty Operations. Specialty revenues, which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other revenues, increased $129.9 million, or 26.2%, to $625.9 million for the fiscal year ended 2003, from $496.0 million for the corresponding fiscal 2002 period. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements, grocery and warehouse club licensing and certain other branded product licensed operations, increased 31.3% to $409.6 million for the fiscal year ended 2003, from $311.9 million for the corresponding fiscal 2002 period. The increase was due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 599 new licensed retail stores during the previous 12 months and growth in the licensed grocery and warehouse club businesses. Foodservice and other revenues increased 17.5% to $216.3 million for the fiscal year ended 2003, from $184.1 million for the corresponding fiscal 2002 period. The increase was primarily attributable to broader distribution and growth in new and existing foodservice accounts. Cost of sales including occupancy costs increased to 41.3% of total net revenues in fiscal 2003, from 41.0% in fiscal 2002. The increase was primarily due to higher green coffee costs and a shift in specialty revenue mix to lower margin products. The Companys green coffee costs reached a historic low for Starbucks in the second and third fiscal quarters of 2002 and have gradually increased since then. These increases were partially offset by leverage gained on fixed occupancy costs distributed over an expanded revenue base. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company operated retail revenues increased to 40.0% in fiscal 2003, from 39.7% in fiscal 2002, primarily due to higher payroll related and advertising expenditures. Payroll related costs have increased primarily due to an increase in the number of partners eligible to participate in the Companys medical and vacation benefits. Advertising expenditures increased in fiscal 2003 due to promotions for new and existing products. These increases were partially offset by lower provisions for asset impairment for International Company operated retail stores in 2003 as compared to the prior year. Other operating expenses (expenses associated with the Companys Specialty Operations) were 22.6% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2003, compared to 21.4% in fiscal 2002, primarily due to higher payroll related expenditures to support the continued development of the Companys foodservice distribution network and international infrastructure, including regional offices and field personnel. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $244.7 million in fiscal 2003, from $210.7 million in fiscal 2002, primarily due to opening 602 Company operated retail stores during the previous 12 months and the refurbishment of existing Company operated retail stores. General and administrative expenses increased to $244.6 million in fiscal 2003, compared to $234.6 million in fiscal 2002, which included an $18.0 million charge for the litigation settlement of two California class action lawsuits. Excluding the litigation charge, general and administrative expenses increased $28.0 million from the comparable fiscal 2002 period due to higher payroll related expenditures and costs related to the acquisition of Seattle Coffee Company. General and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased to 6.0% in fiscal 2003, compared to 7.1% in fiscal 2002. Operating income increased 34.4% to $422.3 million in fiscal 2003, from $314.2 million in fiscal 2002. The operating margin increased to 10.4% of total net revenues in fiscal 2003, compared to 9.6% in fiscal 2002, primarily due to leverage gained on fixed costs distributed over an expanding revenue base, partially offset by higher green coffee costs, as discussed above. Income from equity investees was $38.4 million in fiscal 2003, compared to $33.4 million in fiscal 2002. The increase was mainly attributable to continued strong results by The North American Coffee Partnership, the Companys 50% owned partnership with the Pepsi Cola Company, from expanded ready to drink product lines, lower direct costs and manufacturing efficiencies. Partially offsetting this increase was the Companys proportionate share of the net losses of Starbucks Japan in fiscal 2003, compared to a net profit in fiscal 2002, primarily due to lower average sales per store. Net interest and other income, which primarily consists of interest income, increased to $11.6 million in fiscal 2003, from $9.3 million in fiscal 2002. The growth was a result of increased interest received on higher balances of cash, cash equivalents and liquid securities during fiscal 2003, compared to the prior year, as well as gains realized on market revaluations of the Companys trading securities, compared to realized losses on this portfolio in the prior year. 21 Table of Contents The Companys effective tax rate for fiscal 2003 was 38.5% compared to 37.3% in fiscal 2002, as a result of a shift in the composition of the Companys pretax earnings in fiscal 2003. Operations taxed in the United States had higher pretax earnings and International operations generated greater nondeductible losses during fiscal 2003 than fiscal 2002. 22 Table of Contents Segment Results of Operations The following tables summarize the Companys results of operations by segment for fiscal 2003 and 2002, as restated (in thousands): % of % of % of United Inter Total United States Inter national Unallocated Net 52 weeks ended September 28, 2003 States Revenue national Revenue Corporate Revenue Consolidated Net revenues: Company operated retail $ 2,965,618 85.4 % $ 484,006 80.3 % $ % $ 3,449,624 Specialty: Licensing 301,175 8.7 108,376 18.0 409,551 Foodservice and other 205,659 5.9 10,688 1.7 216,347 Total specialty 506,834 14.6 119,064 19.7 625,898 Total net revenues 3,472,452 100.0 603,070 100.0 4,075,522 Cost of sales including occupancy costs 1,358,836 39.1 322,598 53.5 1,681,434 Store operating expenses 1,199,020 40.4 (1) 180,554 37.3 (1) 1,379,574 Other operating expenses 119,960 23.7 (2) 21,386 18.0 (2) 141,346 Depreciation and amortization expenses 173,747 5.0 38,818 6.4 32,106 0.8 244,671 General and administrative expenses 45,007 1.3 44,352 7.4 155,191 3.8 244,550 Income from equity investees 28,484 0.8 9,912 1.6 38,396 Operating income/(loss) $ 604,366 17.4 % $ 5,274 0.9 % $ (187,297 ) (4.6) % $ 422,343 % of % of % of United Inter Total United States Inter national Unallocated Net 52 weeks ended September 29, 2002 States Revenue national Revenue Corporate Revenue Consolidated Net revenues: Company operated retail $ 2,425,163 85.7 % $ 367,741 79.8 % $ % $ 2,792,904 Specialty: Licensing 227,711 8.1 84,221 18.3 311,932 Foodservice and other 175,379 6.2 8,693 1.9 184,072 Total specialty 403,090 14.3 92,914 20.2 496,004 Total net revenues 2,828,253 100.0 460,655 100.0 3,288,908 Cost of sales including occupancy costs 1,111,640 39.3 235,332 51.1 1,346,972 Store operating expenses 961,617 39.7 (1) 148,165 40.3 (1) 1,109,782 Other operating expenses 87,718 21.8 (2) 18,366 19.8 (2) 106,084 Depreciation and amortization expenses 147,709 5.2 34,257 7.4 28,736 0.9 210,702 General and administrative expenses 33,928 1.2 35,007 7.6 165,646 5.0 234,581 Income from equity investees 19,182 0.7 14,263 3.1 33,445 Operating income/(loss) $ 504,823 17.8 % $ 3,791 0.8 % $ (194,382 ) (5.9 )% $ 314,232 (1) Shown as a percentage of related Company operated retail revenues. (2) Shown as a percentage of related total specialty revenues. United States United States total net revenues increased by $644.2 million, or 22.8%, to $3.5 billion in fiscal year 2003 from $2.8 billion in fiscal 2002. United States Company operated retail revenues increased $540.5 million, or 22.3%, to $3.0 billion, primarily due to the opening of 506 new Company operated retail stores in fiscal 2003 and comparable store sales growth of 9%. The increase in comparable store sales was almost entirely due to higher transaction volume. Total United States specialty revenues increased $103.7 million, or 25.7%, to $506.8 million in fiscal 2003, compared to $403.1 million in fiscal 2002. United States licensing revenues increased $73.5 million, or 32.3%, to $301.1 million in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 315 new licensed retail stores during the previous 12 months and growth in the grocery and warehouse club businesses. United States foodservice and other revenues increased $30.3 million, or 17.3%, to $205.7 million in fiscal 2003, due to broader 23 Table of Contents distribution and growth in new and existing foodservice accounts. United States operating income increased 19.7% to $604.4 million in fiscal 2003, from $504.8 million in fiscal 2002. Operating margin decreased to 17.4% of related revenues from 17.8% in the prior year, primarily due to higher green coffee costs and payroll related expenditures, partially offset by fixed occupancy costs distributed over an expanding revenue base. International International total net revenues increased $142.4 million, or 30.9%, to $603.1 million in fiscal 2003, from $460.7 million for the corresponding fiscal 2002 period. International Company operated retail revenues increased $116.3 million, or 31.6%, to $484.0 million, primarily due to the opening of 96 new Company operated retail stores in fiscal 2003 and comparable store sales growth of 7%. The increase in comparable store sales was almost entirely due to higher transaction volume and reflects the improved operational execution in the U.K. market. Total International specialty revenues increased $26.1 million, or 28.1%, to $119.1 million in fiscal 2003, from $92.9 million in fiscal 2002. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 284 new licensed retail stores during the previous 12 months. International operating income increased 39.1% to $5.3 million in fiscal 2003, from $3.8 million in fiscal 2002. Operating margin increased to 0.9% of related revenues from 0.8% in the corresponding fiscal 2003 period, primarily due to lower provisions recorded for retail store asset impairment and disposals of $3.7 million in fiscal 2003, compared to $13.9 million in fiscal 2002. This was partially offset by Internationals proportionate share of net losses in Starbucks Japan and a shift in sales mix to lower margin products. Unallocated Corporate Unallocated corporate expenses decreased to $187.3 million in fiscal 2003, from $194.4 million in fiscal 2002, primarily due to an $18.0 million litigation settlement in fiscal 2002, partially offset by higher payroll related expenditures in fiscal 2003. Total unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased from 5.9% in fiscal 2002 to 4.6% in fiscal 2003. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table represents components of the Companys most liquid assets (in thousands): Fiscal year ended Oct 3, 2004 Sept 28, 2003 Cash and cash equivalents $ 299,128 $ 200,907 Short term investments available for sale and trading securities 353,881 149,104 Long term investments available for sale securities 135,179 136,159 Total cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments $ 788,188 $ 486,170 The Company manages its cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments in order to internally fund operating needs. Cash and cash equivalents increased by $98 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, to $299 million. The Company ended the period with $788 million in total cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments. The Company intends to use its available cash resources to invest in its core businesses and other new business opportunities related to its core businesses. The Company may use its available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to its equity method and cost method investees. Depending on market conditions, Starbucks may acquire additional shares of its common stock. Management believes that existing cash and investments, as well as cash generated from operations, should be sufficient to finance capital requirements for its core businesses for the foreseeable future. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions or other new business opportunities may require outside funding. Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2005 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures related to new Company operated retail stores, as well as for the remodeling and refurbishment of existing Company operated retail stores. Management expects capital expenditures in fiscal 2005 to be in the range of $600 million to $650 million. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $820 million in fiscal 2004 and was generated primarily by net earnings of $391 million and noncash depreciation and amortization expenses of $314 million. Cash used by investing activities totaled $659 million in fiscal 2004. Net capital additions to property, plant and equipment 24 Table of Contents used $413 million, primarily from opening 634 new Company operated retail stores and remodeling certain existing stores. Gross capital additions for fiscal 2004 were $460 million and were offset by the change in disposal and foreign currency translation adjustments totaling $47 million. The net activity in the Companys portfolio of available for sale securities during fiscal 2004 used $212 million. Excess cash was invested in investment grade securities. During fiscal 2004, the Company made additional equity investments of its proportionate share in a number of its International investees and acquired a 49.9% interest in its Malaysia licensed operations for a combined total of $65 million, excluding the effects of foreign currency fluctuations. Cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2004 totaled $67 million. During fiscal 2004, the Company repurchased 5 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $40.85 per share, using $203 million of cash. Share repurchases are at the discretion of management and depend on market conditions, capital requirements and such other factors as the Company may consider relevant. As of October 3, 2004, 19 million additional shares were authorized for repurchase. The exercise of employee stock options and the sale of the Companys common stock from employee stock purchase plans provided $138 million. As options granted under the Companys stock plans are exercised, the Company will continue to receive proceeds and a tax deduction; however, the amounts and the timing cannot be predicted. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and borrowings as of October 3, 2004, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on the Companys liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Less than 1 More than 5 Contractual obligations Total Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years Years Long term debt obligations $ 4,353 $ 735 $ 1,510 $ 1,565 $ 543 Operating lease obligations 2,609,036 355,079 661,407 572,407 1,020,143 Purchase obligations 283,379 188,884 89,720 4,775 Total $ 2,896,768 $ 544,698 $ 752,637 $ 578,747 $ 1,020,686 Starbucks expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business. Off Balance Sheet Arrangement The Company has unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain Japanese yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of an unconsolidated equity investee, Starbucks Coffee Japan, Ltd. The guarantees continue until the loans, including accrued interest and fees, have been paid in full. The maximum amount is limited to the sum of unpaid principal and interest amounts, as well as other related expenses. These amounts will vary based on fluctuations in the yen foreign exchange rate. As of October 3, 2004, the maximum amount of the guarantees was approximately $10.6 million. Since there has been no modification of these loan guarantees subsequent to the Companys adoption of FASB Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indebtedness of Others, Starbucks has applied the disclosure provisions only and has not recorded the guarantee in its statement of financial position. Product Warranties Coffee brewing and espresso equipment sold to customers through Company operated and licensed retail stores, as well as equipment sold to the Companys licensees for use in retail licensing operations, are under warranty for defects in materials and workmanship for a period ranging from 12 to 24 months. The Company establishes an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale, based on historical experience. The following table summarizes the activity related to product warranty reserves during fiscal 2004 and 2003 (in thousands): Fiscal year ended Oct 3, 2004 Sept 28, 2003 Balance at beginning of fiscal year $ 2,227 $ 1,842 Provision for warranties issued 5,093 2,895 Warranty claims (4,229 ) (2,510 ) Balance at end of fiscal year $ 3,091 $ 2,227 COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS The supply and price of coffee are subject to significant volatility. Although most coffee trades in the commodity market, coffee of the quality sought by Starbucks tends to trade on a negotiated basis at a substantial premium above commodity coffee prices, depending upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase. Supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing countries, including weather, political and economic conditions. In addition, green coffee prices have been affected in the past, and may be affected in the future, by the actions of certain organizations and associations that have 25 Table of Contents historically attempted to influence commodity prices of green coffee through agreements establishing export quotas or restricting coffee supplies worldwide. The Companys ability to raise sales prices in response to rising coffee prices may be limited, and the Companys profitability could be adversely affected if coffee prices were to rise substantially. The Company enters into fixed price purchase commitments in order to secure an adequate supply of quality green coffee and bring greater certainty to the cost of sales in future periods. As of October 3, 2004, the Company had $271.7 million in fixed price purchase commitments which, together with existing inventory, is expected to provide an adequate supply of green coffee through calendar 2005. The Company believes, based on relationships established with its suppliers in the past, the risk of nondelivery on such purchase commitments is low. During fiscal 2004, fluid milk prices in the United States, which closely follow the monthly Class I fluid milk base price as calculated by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, reached an all time high. Should dairy costs remain at current levels or continue to rise, the Companys profitability could be adversely affected. While management continues to monitor published dairy prices on the related commodities markets, management cannot predict with any certainty the future prices to be paid for dairy products. In addition to fluctuating commodity prices, management believes that the Companys future results of operations and earnings could be significantly impacted by other factors, such as increased competition within the specialty coffee industry, the Companys ability to find optimal store locations at favorable lease rates, increased costs associated with opening and operating retail stores and the Companys continued ability to hire, train and retain qualified personnel, as well as other factors discussed under Certain Additional Risks and Uncertainties in the Business section of the Companys Annual Report on Form 10 K/A for the fiscal year ended October 3, 2004. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The majority of the Companys revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of the Companys operations consists of activities outside of the United States, the Company has transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Euro and Japanese yen. As part of its risk management strategy, the Company frequently evaluates its foreign currency exchange risk by monitoring market data and external factors that may influence exchange rate fluctuations. As a result, Starbucks may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments, with maturities generally not exceeding five years, to hedge assets, liabilities, revenues and purchases denominated in foreign currencies. As of October 3, 2004, the Company had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges under SFAS No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to hedge a portion of anticipated international revenue and product purchases. In addition, Starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as a hedge of its net investment in Starbucks Japan. These contracts expire within 31 months. Based on the foreign exchange contracts outstanding as of October 3, 2004, a 10% devaluation of the U.S. dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates for currencies under contract as of October 3, 2004, would result in a reduced fair value of these derivative financial instruments of approximately $20.7 million, of which $14.0 million may reduce the Companys future net earnings. Conversely, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar would result in an increase in the fair value of these instruments of approximately $18.1 million, of which $12.6 million may increase the Companys future net earnings. Consistent with the nature of the economic hedges provided by these foreign exchange contracts, increases or decreases in the fair value would be mostly offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the dollar value of the Companys foreign investment, future foreign currency royalty fee payments and product purchases that would occur within the hedging period. Equity Security Price Risk The Company has minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds within its trading portfolio. The trading securities approximate a portion of the Companys liability under the Management Deferred Compensation Plan (MDCP). A corresponding liability is included in Accrued compensation and related costs on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. These investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in Interest and other income, net. The offsetting changes in the MDCP liability are recorded in General and administrative expenses on the accompanying consolidated statements of earnings. 26 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk The Companys diversified available for sale portfolios consist mainly of fixed income instruments. The primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity. Available for sale securities are investment grade and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). The Company does not hedge its interest rate exposure. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying interest rate of its interest bearing financial instruments held at the end of fiscal 2004, and determined that such a change would not have a material effect on the fair value of these instruments. SEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY RESULTS The Companys business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Significant portions of the Companys net revenues and profits are realized during the first quarter of the Companys fiscal year, which includes the December holiday season. In addition, quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores, and the Companys rapid growth may conceal the impact of other seasonal influences. Because of the seasonality of the Companys business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results, and require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Starbucks considers its policies on impairment of long lived assets to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets to projected future cash flows, in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses. For goodwill and other intangible assets, impairment tests are performed annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the Companys trademarks. Upon indication that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable, the Company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations. Property, plant and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment. Cash flows for retail assets are identified at the individual store level. Long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Judgments made by the Company related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability of the Company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. As the Company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its long lived assets, these factors could cause the Company to realize material impairment charges. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In December 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 Revised, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities an Interpretation of ARB No. 51 (FIN 46R), which provided, among other things, immediate deferral of the application of FIN 46 for entities that did not originally qualify as special purpose entities, and provided additional scope exceptions for joint ventures with business operations and franchises. The Companys adoption of FIN 46R did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. In December 2003, the issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 104, Revenue Recognition (SAB 104), rescinded the accounting guidance contained in SAB 101, Revenue Recognition in Financial Statements, and incorporated the body of previously issued guidance related to multiple element revenue arrangements. The Companys adoption of SAB 104 did not have an impact on its consolidated financial statements. In March 2004, the FASB ratified Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue No. 03 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and its Application to Certain Investments (EITF 03 1), but delayed the recognition and measurement provisions of EITF 03 1 in September 2004. For reporting periods beginning after June 15, 2004, only the 27 Table of Contents disclosure requirements for available for sale securities and cost method investments are required. The Companys adoption of the requirements in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2004 did not have a significant impact on the Companys disclosures. In July 2004, the FASB issued EITF Issue No. 02 14, Whether an Investor Should Apply the Equity Method of Accounting to Investments Other Than Common Stock (EITF 02 14). EITF 02 14 requires application of the equity method of accounting when an investor is able to exert significant influence over operating and financial policies of an investee through ownership of common stock or in substance common stock. EITF 02 14 is effective for reporting periods beginning after September 15, 2004. The adoption of EITF 02 14 will not have a significant impact on the Companys consolidated financial position or results of operations. Item 7A.
