Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Starbucks Corporations fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. The fiscal years ended on October 2, 2005 and September 28, 2003, included 52 weeks. The fiscal year ended October 3, 2004, included 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in the fiscal fourth quarter. Management Overview During the fiscal year ended October 2, 2005, all areas of Starbucks business, from U.S. and International Company operated retail operations to the Companys specialty businesses, delivered strong financial performance. Starbucks believes the Companys ability to achieve the balance between growing its core business and building the foundation for future growth is the key to increasing long term shareholder value. Starbucks fiscal 2005 performance reflects the Companys continuing commitment to achieving this balance. The primary driver of the Companys revenue growth continues to be the opening of new retail stores, both Company operated and licensed, in pursuit of the Companys objective to establish Starbucks as the most recognized and respected brand in the world. Starbucks opened 1,672 new stores in fiscal 2005 and plans to open approximately 1,800 in fiscal 2006. With a presence in 37 countries, management continues to believe that the Companys long term goal of 15,000 Starbucks retail locations throughout the United States and at least 15,000 stores in International markets is achievable. In addition to opening new retail stores, Starbucks works to increase revenues generated at new and existing Company operated stores by attracting new customers and increasing the frequency of visits by current 21 Table of Contents customers. The strategy is to increase comparable store sales by continuously improving the level of customer service, introducing innovative products and improving the speed of service through training, technology and process improvement. Global comparable store sales for Company operated markets increased by 8%, making fiscal 2005 the 14th consecutive year with comparable store sales growth of five percent or greater. Comparable store sales for fiscal 2006 are expected to be in the range of three to seven percent. In licensed retail operations, Starbucks leverages the expertise of local partners and shares its operating and store development experience to help licensees improve the profitability of existing stores and build new stores. Internationally, the Companys strategy is to selectively increase its equity stake in licensed international operations as these markets develop. The combination of more retail stores, higher revenues from existing stores and growth in other business channels in both the United States and International operating segments resulted in a 20% increase in total net revenues for the 52 weeks of fiscal 2005, compared to the 53 weeks of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, total net revenues increased 23%. Both of these revenue growth measures were at or above the Companys three to five year target of approximately 20%. The Companys International operations delivered improved operating results, primarily due to leverage gained on most operating expenses distributed over an expanded revenue base. In recent fiscal years, the Company made substantial infrastructure investments in corporate and regional support facilities and personnel, as well as established more efficient distribution networks. Such investments have been and will continue to be necessary to support the Companys planned international expansion, which is now realizing substantial benefit from this foundation. Since both additional International and U.S. retail stores can leverage existing support organizations and facilities, the Companys infrastructure can be expanded more slowly than the rate of revenue growth and generate margin improvement. In fiscal 2005, operating income as a percentage of total net revenues increased to 12.3% from 11.5% in fiscal 2004, and net earnings increased by 27%, compared to fiscal 2004. These results demonstrated the Companys ability to improve operating margin while at the same time making strategic investments in the core retail business and in emerging specialty channels. Acquisitions During fiscal 2005, Starbucks increased its equity ownership in its licensed operations in Germany, Southern China and Chile, to 100%, 51% and 100%, respectively, for a combined purchase price of $41 million. Previously, the Company owned less than 20% in each of these operations, which were accounted for under the cost method. These increases in equity ownership resulted in a change of accounting method, from the cost method to the consolidation method, on the respective dates of acquisition. This accounting change also included adjusting previously reported information for the Companys proportionate share of net losses in Germany, Southern China and Chile. The cumulative effect of the accounting change for previously reported information resulted in a reduction of net earnings of $0.1 million for the 39 weeks ended July 3, 2005, and a reduction of retained earnings of $4.0 million prior to fiscal 2005. In April 2005, Starbucks acquired substantially all of the assets of Ethos Brands, LLC, (Ethos), a privately held bottled water company based in Santa Monica, California, for $8 million. The earnings of Ethos are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition. 22 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004 The following table presents the consolidated statement of earnings as well as the percentage relationship to total net revenues, unless otherwise indicated, of items included in the Companys consolidated statements of earnings (amounts in thousands): Oct 2, 2005 % of Oct 3, 2004 % of Sept 28, 2003 % of Fiscal Year Ended (52 Wks) Revenues (53 Wks) Revenues (52 Wks) Revenues STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS DATA Net revenues: Company operated retail $ 5,391,927 84.7 % $ 4,457,378 84.2 % $ 3,449,624 84.6 % Specialty: Licensing 673,015 10.5 565,798 10.7 409,551 10.1 Foodservice and other 304,358 4.8 271,071 5.1 216,347 5.3 Total specialty 977,373 15.3 836,869 15.8 625,898 15.4 Total net revenues 6,369,300 100.0 5,294,247 100.0 4,075,522 100.0 Cost of sales including occupancy costs 2,605,212 40.9 2,191,440 41.4 1,681,434 41.3 Store operating expenses 2,165,911 40.2 (1) 1,790,168 40.2 (1) 1,379,574 40.0 (1) Other operating expenses 197,024 20.2 (2) 171,648 20.5 (2) 141,346 22.6 (2) Depreciation and amortization expenses 340,169 5.3 289,182 5.5 244,671 6.0 General and administrative expenses 357,114 5.6 304,293 5.7 244,550 6.0 Subtotal operating expenses 5,665,430 88.9 4,746,731 89.7 3,691,575 90.6 Income from equity investees 76,745 1.2 59,071 1.1 36,903 0.9 Operating income 780,615 12.3 606,587 11.5 420,850 10.3 Interest and other income, net 15,829 0.2 14,140 0.2 11,622 0.3 Earnings before income taxes 796,444 12.5 620,727 11.7 432,472 10.6 Income taxes 301,977 4.7 231,754 4.4 167,117 4.1 Net earnings $ 494,467 7.8 % $ 388,973 7.3 % $ 265,355 6.5 % (1) Shown as a percentage of related Company operated retail revenues. (2) Shown as a percentage of related total specialty revenues. Consolidated Results of Operations Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2005 increased 20% to $6.4 billion from $5.3 billion for the 53 week period of fiscal 2004, driven by increases in both Company operated retail revenues and specialty operations. Net revenues increased 23% when calculated on a comparative 52 week basis for both fiscal 2005 and 2004. Net revenues are expected to grow approximately 20% in fiscal 2006 compared to fiscal 2005. During the fiscal year ended 2005, Starbucks derived 85% of total net revenues from its Company operated retail stores. Company operated retail revenues increased 21% to $5.4 billion for the fiscal year ended 2005, 23 Table of Contents from $4.5 billion for the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. Company operated retail revenues increased 23% when calculated on a comparative 52 week basis for both fiscal 2005 and 2004. This increase was primarily due to the opening of 735 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 8% for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 4% increase in the average value per transaction. Comparable store sales growth percentages were calculated excluding the extra week of fiscal 2004. Management believes increased customer traffic continues to be driven by new product innovation, continued popularity of core products, a high level of customer satisfaction and improved speed of service through enhanced technology, training and execution at retail stores. The increase in the average value per transaction was primarily due to a beverage price increase in October 2004 in the Companys U.S. and Canadian markets. The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company operated retail stores, collectively known as Specialty Operations. Specialty revenues, which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other revenues, increased 17% to $977 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, from $837 million for the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, total specialty revenues increased 19%. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements, as well as grocery, warehouse club and certain other branded product licensed operations, increased 19% to $673 million for the 52 week period of 2005, from $566 million for the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, total licensing revenues increased 21%, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 937 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased 12% to $304 million for the 52 week period of fiscal 2005, from $271 million for the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, foodservice and other revenues increased 15%, primarily attributable to growth in new and existing U.S. and International foodservice accounts and, to a lesser extent, growth in the Companys emerging entertainment business. Cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased to 40.9% of total net revenues in the 52 week period of fiscal 2005, from 41.4% in the 53 week period of 2004. The decrease was primarily due to higher average revenue per retail transaction, offset in part by higher initial costs associated with the continued expansion of a lunch program in Company operated retail stores. Approximately 3,800 Company operated stores had the lunch program at the end of fiscal 2005, compared to approximately 2,600 at the end of fiscal 2004. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company operated retail revenues were 40.2% for both the 52 week period of fiscal 2005 and the 53 week period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to higher average revenue per retail transaction in fiscal 2005, offset by higher payroll related expenditures, as well as higher maintenance and repair expenditures to ensure a consistent Starbucks Experience in existing stores. In order to facilitate ongoing retail store revenue growth, the Company opened a higher number of drive thru locations over the past year and extended store operating hours, which contributed to the higher payroll related expenditures. Other operating expenses (expenses associated with the Companys Specialty Operations) decreased to 20.2% of specialty revenues in the 52 week period of fiscal 2005, compared to 20.5% in the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. The decrease was primarily due to lower expenditures within the grocery, warehouse club and foodservice businesses, partially offset by higher payroll related expenditures to support the Companys emerging entertainment business and to support the growth of Seattles Best Coffee licensed caf operations. 24 Table of Contents Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $340 million in the 52 week period of fiscal 2005, from $289 million in the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily from the opening of 735 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.3% for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005, from 5.5% for the corresponding 53 week fiscal 2004 period. General and administrative expenses increased to $357 million in the 52 week period of fiscal 2005, compared to $304 million in the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll related expenditures in support of both domestic and international business growth and increased charitable donations to support multi year corporate commitments. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.6% for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005, from 5.7% for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004. Income from equity investees increased to $77 million in the 52 week period of fiscal 2005, compared to $59 million in the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to volume driven operating results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces bottled Frappuccino coffee drinks and Starbucks DoubleShot espresso drink, and improved operating results from international investees, particularly in Japan and Korea, mainly as a result of new store openings. Operating income increased 29% to $781 million in the 52 week period of fiscal 2005, from $607 million in the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. The operating margin increased to 12.3% of total net revenues in the 52 week period of fiscal 2005, compared to 11.5% in the 53 week period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to strong revenue growth. Net interest and other income, which primarily consists of interest income, increased to $16 million in the 52 week period of fiscal 2005, from $14 million in the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to higher interest income earned due to higher interest rates in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 and to foreign exchange gains in fiscal 2005 compared to losses in fiscal 2004. Partially offsetting these increases were higher realized losses on sales of available for sale securities. Starbucks funded the majority of its share repurchases during fiscal 2005 through sales of its available for sale securities. Income taxes for the 52 weeks ended October 2, 2005, resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.9%, compared to 37.3% in fiscal 2004. The effective tax rate differs from the statutory rate of 35% due to a variety of factors, including state income taxes, the impact from foreign operations, tax credits and other provision adjustments. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2006 is expected to be approximately 38%, with quarterly variations. 25 Table of Contents Operating Segments Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the Companys management reviews financial information for operational decision making purposes.

United States operations sells coffee and other beverages, whole bean coffees, complementary food, coffee brewing equipment and merchandise primarily through Company operated retail stores. Specialty Operations within the United States include licensed retail stores and other licensing operations, foodservice accounts and other initiatives related to the Companys core business. United States total net revenues increased 19% to $5.3 billion for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $4.5 billion for the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, United States total net revenues increased 21%. United States Company operated retail revenues increased 19% to $4.5 billion for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $3.8 billion for the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, United States Company operated retail revenues increased 22%, primarily due to the opening of 574 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 9% for the 52 week period of fiscal 2005. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 5% increase in the average value per transaction, including 3% attributable to a beverage price increase in October 2004, and a 4% increase in the number of customer transactions. Management believes increased customer traffic continues to be driven by new product innovation, continued popularity of core products, a high level of customer satisfaction and improved speed of service through enhanced technology, training and execution at retail stores. Total United States specialty revenues increased 15% to $795 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $690 million in the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, United States specialty revenues increased 18%. United States licensing revenues increased 18% to $515 million, compared to $437 million for the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, United States licensing revenues increased 20%, primarily due to increased product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 596 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased 10% to $280 million from $254 million for the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, United States foodservice and other revenues increased 13%, primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts, as well as growth in the emerging entertainment business. United States operating income increased by 24% to $946 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, from $763 million for the fiscal year ended 2004. Operating margin increased to 17.7% of related revenues from 17.0% in the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. The increase was primarily due to leverage from strong revenue growth, partially offset by higher retail store operating expenses primarily due to higher payroll related expenditures to facilitate ongoing retail store revenue growth. International The Companys international operations (International) represent the remaining 16% of Company operated retail revenues, 19% of total specialty revenues and 16% of total net revenues. International operations sells coffee and other beverages, whole bean coffees, complementary food, coffee brewing equipment and merchandise through Company operated retail stores in the United Kingdom, Canada, Thailand, Australia, Germany, Singapore, China, Chile and Ireland. Specialty Operations in International primarily include retail store licensing operations in more than 25 other countries and foodservice accounts in Canada and the United Kingdom. Certain of the Companys International operations are in various early stages of development that 27 Table of Contents necessitate a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income, than in the United States. International total net revenues increased 29% to $1.0 billion for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $803 million for the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, International total net revenues increased 31%. International Company operated retail revenues increased 30% to $852 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $657 million for the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, International Company operated revenues increased 32%, primarily due to the opening of 161 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months, comparable store sales growth of 6% for the 52 week period of fiscal 2005, and the weakening of the U.S. dollar against both the Canadian dollar and British pound sterling. The increase in comparable store sales resulted from a 4% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 2% increase in the average value per transaction. Total International specialty revenues increased 25% to $182 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $146 million for the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in fiscal 2004, International specialty revenues increased 27%. International licensing revenues increased 23% to $158 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $129 million in the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in 2004, International licensing revenues increased 25%, primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 341 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months, volume driven growth in the Canadian grocery and warehouse club businesses, and, to a lesser extent, the launch of new ready to drink coffee beverages in Japan and Taiwan. International foodservice and other revenues increased 38% to $24 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $18 million in the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. Excluding the impact of the extra week in 2004, international foodservice and other revenues increased 41%, primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts. International operating income increased to $86 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, compared to $52 million in the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. Operating margin increased to 8.4% of related revenues from 6.4% in the 53 week period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to leverage gained on most fixed costs distributed over an expanded revenue base. Unallocated Corporate Unallocated corporate expenses pertain to certain functions, such as executive management, accounting, administration, tax, treasury and information technology infrastructure, that support but are not specifically attributable to the Companys operating segments, and include related depreciation and amortization expenses. Unallocated corporate expenses increased to $252 million for the fiscal year ended 2005, from $208 million in the 53 week period of fiscal 2004, primarily due to increased charitable commitments as well as higher payroll related expenditures. Total unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of total net revenues remained unchanged at 3.9% for the fiscal year ended 2005 and the 53 week period of fiscal 2004. 28 Table of Contents RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003 Consolidated Results of Operations Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2004 increased 30% to $5.3 billion from $4.1 billion for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. Net revenues increased 27% when calculated on a comparative 52 week basis for both fiscal 2004 and 2003. During the fiscal year ended 2004, Starbucks derived 84% of total net revenues from its Company operated retail stores. Company operated retail revenues increased 29% to $4.5 billion for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $3.4 billion for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. Company operated retail revenues increased 27% when calculated on a comparative 52 week basis for both fiscal 2004 and 2003. This increase was primarily due to the opening of 634 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 10%. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 9% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 1% increase in the average value per transaction. Comparable store sales growth percentages were calculated excluding the extra week of fiscal 2004. The Company derived the remaining 16% of total net revenues from its Specialty Operations. Specialty revenues, which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other revenues, increased 34% to $837 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $626 million for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, total specialty revenues increased 31% to $820 million. Licensing revenues increased 38% to $566 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $410 million for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. The increase was due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the addition of 710 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and growth in the grocery and warehouse club businesses. The growth in the grocery and warehouse club businesses was a result of expanded agreements with Kraft Foods, Inc., which included the addition of six new Starbucks coffees along with a selection of Tazo teas, and the acquisition of Seattle Coffee Company in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Foodservice and other revenues increased 25% to $271 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $216 million for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily attributable to the growth in new and existing foodservice accounts, which benefited from the July 2003 acquisition of Seattle Coffee Company. Cost of sales including occupancy costs increased to 41.4% of total net revenues in fiscal 2004, from 41.3% in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to higher dairy and green coffee commodity costs, partially offset by leverage gained on occupancy costs, which are primarily fixed expenses. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company operated retail revenues increased to 40.2% in fiscal 2004, from 40.0% in fiscal 2003, primarily due to higher marketing expenditures for holiday and new product promotions, as well as increased costs to maintain retail stores and equipment due to sustained high traffic levels. Other operating expenses (expenses associated with the Companys Specialty Operations) decreased to 20.5% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2004, compared to 22.6% in fiscal 2003. The decrease was primarily due to leverage gained on payroll related expenditures distributed over an expanded revenue base. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $289 million in fiscal 2004, from $245 million in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to a net increase of 634 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months and higher depreciation expenses associated with shortened estimated useful lives of equipment deployed in the Companys foodservice operations. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.5% for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004, from 6.0% for the corresponding 29 Table of Contents 52 week fiscal 2003 period, primarily due to the leverage of fixed depreciation expenses from the extra sales week in 2004. General and administrative expenses increased to $304 million in fiscal 2004, compared to $245 million in fiscal 2003, primarily due to higher payroll related expenditures. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.7% for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004, from 6.0% for the 52 weeks ended September 28, 2003. Income from equity investees was $59 million in fiscal 2004, compared to $37 million in fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to volume driven operating results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces bottled Frappuccino coffee drinks and Starbucks DoubleShot coffee drink, and improved profitability of Starbucks Coffee Japan, Ltd. (Starbucks Japan). The July 2003 increase in the Companys ownership interest from 5% to 50% in the Taiwan and Shanghai licensed operations also contributed to the growth. Operating income increased 44% to $607 million in fiscal 2004, from $421 million in fiscal 2003. The operating margin increased to 11.5% of total net revenues in fiscal 2004, compared to 10.3% in fiscal 2003, primarily due to leverage gained on most fixed operating costs distributed over an expanded revenue base, partially offset by higher dairy and green coffee commodity costs. Net interest and other income, which primarily consists of interest income, increased to $14 million in fiscal 2004, from $12 million in fiscal 2003. The growth was a result of interest income earned on higher cash and liquid investment balances during fiscal 2004, compared to the prior year. Income taxes for the 53 weeks ended October 3, 2004, resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.3%, compared to 38.6% in fiscal 2003. The lower effective tax rate was primarily due to improved operating results as fewer nondeductible losses were generated from international markets, which are in various phases of development. 30 Table of Contents Operating Segments Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the Companys management reviews financial information for operational decision making purposes. The following tables summarize the Companys results of operations by segment for fiscal 2004 and 2003 (in thousands): % of % of % of United Inter Total United States Inter national Unallocated Net 53 Weeks Ended October 3, 2004 States Revenue national Revenue Corporate Revenue Consolidated Net revenues: Company operated retail $ 3,800,367 84.6 % $ 657,011 81.8 % $ % $ 4,457,378 Specialty: Licensing 436,981 9.7 128,817 16.0 565,798 Foodservice and other 253,502 5.7 17,569 2.2 271,071 Total specialty 690,483 15.4 146,386 18.2 836,869 Total net revenues 4,490,850 100.0 803,397 100.0 5,294,247 Cost of sales including occupancy costs 1,782,584 39.7 408,856 50.9 2,191,440 Store operating expenses 1,546,871 40.7 (1) 243,297 37.0 (1) 1,790,168 Other operating expenses 144,853 21.0 (2) 26,795 18.3 (2) 171,648 Depreciation and amortization expenses 210,448 4.7 46,196 5.8 32,538 0.6 289,182 General and administrative expenses 80,221 1.8 48,206 6.0 175,866 3.3 304,293 Income from equity investees 37,453 0.8 21,618 2.7 59,071 Operating income/(loss) $ 763,326 17.0 % $ 51,665 6.4 % $ (208,404 ) (3.9 )% $ 606,587 % of % of % of United Inter Total United States Inter national Unallocated Net 52 Weeks Ended September 28, 2003 States Revenue national Revenue Corporate Revenue Consolidated Net revenues: Company operated retail $ 2,965,618 85.4 % $ 484,006 80.3 % $ % $ 3,449,624 Specialty: Licensing 301,175 8.7 108,376 18.0 409,551 Foodservice and other 205,659 5.9 10,688 1.7 216,347 Total specialty 506,834 14.6 119,064 19.7 625,898 Total net revenues 3,472,452 100.0 603,070 100.0 4,075,522 Cost of sales including occupancy costs 1,358,836 39.1 322,598 53.5 1,681,434 Store operating expenses 1,199,020 40.4 (1) 180,554 37.3 (1) 1,379,574 Other operating expenses 119,960 23.7 (2) 21,386 18.0 (2) 141,346 Depreciation and amortization expenses 173,747 5.0 38,818 6.4 32,106 0.8 244,671 General and administrative expenses 45,007 1.3 44,352 7.4 155,191 3.8 244,550 Income from equity investees 28,484 0.8 8,419 1.4 36,903 Operating income/(loss) $ 604,366 17.4 % $ 3,781 0.6 % $ (187,297 ) (4.6 )% $ 420,850 (1) Shown as a percentage of related Company operated retail revenues.

Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, United States total net revenues increased 27% to $4.4 billion. United States Company operated retail revenues increased 28% to $3.8 billion for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to $3.0 billion for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to the opening of 514 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 11%. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 10% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 1% increase in the average value per transaction. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, United States Company operated retail revenues increased 26% to $3.7 billion. Total United States specialty revenues increased 36% to $690 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to $507 million in the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, United States specialty revenues increased 33% to $676 million. United States licensing revenues increased 45% to $437 million, compared to $301 million for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to volume driven growth in the grocery and warehouse club businesses as a result of expanded agreements with Kraft Foods Inc., which included the addition of six new Starbucks coffees along with a selection of Tazo teas. In addition, product sales and royalty revenues increased as a result of opening 417 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased 23% to $254 million from $206 million in fiscal 2003, due to both the addition of new and existing Starbucks and Seattle Coffee Company foodservice accounts. United States operating income increased by 26% to $763 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $604 million for the fiscal year ended 2003. Operating margin decreased to 17.0% of related revenues from 17.4% in the 52 week period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to higher dairy and green coffee commodity costs, as well as higher payroll related expenditures to support the Companys ongoing retail store growth. These increases were partially offset by leverage gained on fixed occupancy costs distributed over an expanded revenue base. International International total net revenues increased 33% to $803 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to $603 million for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, International total net revenues increased 31%. International Company operated retail revenues increased 36% to $657 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to $484 million for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 120 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months, the weakening of the U.S. dollar against both the British pound sterling and Canadian dollar, and comparable store sales growth of 6%. The increase in comparable store sales resulted from a 5% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 1% increase in the average value per transaction. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, International Company operated retail revenues increased 33% to $644 million. Total International specialty revenues increased 23% to $146 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to $119 million for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. Excluding the impact of the extra sales week in fiscal 2004, International specialty revenues increased 21% to $144 million. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 293 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months, partially offset by proportionate eliminations of sales to equity investees in which the Company increased its ownership interest in late fiscal 2003. 32 Table of Contents International operating income increased to $52 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to $4 million in the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. Operating margin increased to 6.4% of related revenues from 0.6% in the 52 week period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to leverage gained on most fixed costs distributed over an expanded revenue base. Unallocated Corporate Unallocated corporate expenses increased to $208 million for the fiscal year ended 2004, from $187 million in the 52 week period of fiscal 2003, primarily due to higher provisions for incentive compensation based on the Companys performance and other payroll related expenditures. Total unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased to 3.9% for the fiscal year ended 2004, compared to 4.6% for the 52 week period of fiscal 2003. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table represents components of the Companys most liquid assets (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2, 2005 Oct 3, 2004 Cash and cash equivalents $ 173,809 $ 145,053 Short term investments available for sale 95,379 483,157 Short term investments trading securities 37,848 24,799 Long term investments available for sale securities 60,475 135,179 Total $ 367,511 $ 788,188 Starbucks has reclassified its auction rate securities of $154.1 million, previously classified in Cash and cash equivalents, as Short term investments available for sale securities on the consolidated balance sheet as of October 3, 2004. The Company had historically classified these securities as cash equivalents based on managements ability to liquidate its holdings during the predetermined interest rate reset auctions, which generally occurred within 90 days of acquiring the securities. Although management had determined the risk of failure of an auction process to be remote, the definition of a cash equivalent in Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 95, Statement of Cash Flows, required reclassification to short term investments. The Company has made corresponding adjustments to its consolidated statement of cash flows for the prior fiscal years of 2004 and 2003 to reflect the gross purchases, sales and maturities of auction rate securities as investing activities rather than as a component of cash and cash equivalents. There was no impact on previously reported cash flows from operating activities as a result of the reclassification. The Company manages its cash, cash equivalents and liquid investments in order to internally fund operating needs. The $421 million decline in total cash and cash equivalents and liquid investments from October 3, 2004 to October 2, 2005, was nearly all due to the sale of securities to fund common stock repurchases. The Company intends to use its available cash resources, including any borrowings under its revolving credit facility described below, to invest in its core businesses and other new business opportunities related to its core businesses. The Company may use its available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to its equity method and cost method investees, as well as purchase larger ownership interests in selected equity method investees, particularly in international markets. Depending on market conditions, Starbucks may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. Management believes that strong cash flow generated from operations, existing cash and investments, as well as borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility, should be sufficient to finance capital requirements for its core businesses 33 Table of Contents for the foreseeable future. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions, share repurchases and or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2006 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for new Company operated retail stores and the remodeling and refurbishment of existing Company operated retail stores, as well as for additional share repurchases, if any. For fiscal 2006, management expects capital expenditures to be in the range of $700 million to $725 million, related to opening approximately 850 Company operated stores on a global basis, remodeling certain existing stores and enhancing its production capacity and information systems. In August 2005, the Company entered into a $500 million unsecured five year revolving credit facility (the Facility) with various banks, of which $100 million may be used for issuances of letters of credit. The Facility is scheduled to expire in August 2010 and is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, which may include acquisitions and share repurchases. The Company may request an increase up to an additional $500 million under the credit facility, provided there is no existing default, which would increase total availability to $1 billion. The interest rate for borrowings under the Facility ranges from 0.150% to 0.275% over LIBOR or an alternate base rate, which is the greater of the bank prime rate or the Federal Funds Rate plus 0.50%. The specific spread over LIBOR will depend upon the Companys performance under specified financial criteria. The Facility contains provisions that require the Company to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including the maintenance of certain financial ratios. As of October 2, 2005, the Company was in compliance with each of these covenants. There were borrowings of $277 million outstanding under the Facility as of October 2, 2005, with a weighted average contractual interest rate of 4.0%. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $924 million in fiscal 2005 and was generated primarily by net earnings of $494 million and noncash depreciation and amortization expenses of $367 million. Cash used by investing activities totaled $221 million in fiscal 2005. Net capital additions to property, plant and equipment used $644 million, primarily from opening 735 new Company operated retail stores and remodeling certain existing stores. Gross capital additions for fiscal 2005 were $668 million and were offset by impairment provisions and foreign currency translation adjustments totaling $24 million. During fiscal 2005, the Company increased its equity ownership in its licensed operations in Germany, Southern China and Chile and also acquired substantially all of the assets of Ethos Brands, LLC, which together used $22 million, net of cash acquired. Partially offsetting these uses of cash, the net activity in the Companys portfolio of available for sale securities provided $452 million for the fiscal year ended October 2, 2005. Cash used by financing activities in fiscal 2005 totaled $674 million. During fiscal 2005, the Company repurchased 45 million shares of its common stock at an average price of $25.26 per share, using $1.1 billion. Share repurchases, up to the limit authorized by the Board of Directors, are at the discretion of management and depend on market conditions, capital requirements and other factors. The total remaining amount of shares authorized for repurchase as of October 2, 2005 was 22 million. Partially offsetting cash used for share repurchases were borrowings of $277 million under the Facility and $164 million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the sale of the Companys common stock from employee stock purchase plans. As options granted are exercised, the Company will continue to receive proceeds (financing activity) and a tax deduction (operating activity); however, the amounts and the timing cannot be predicted. 34 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and borrowings as of October 2, 2005, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on the Companys liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Less Than More Than Contractual Obligations Total 1 Year 1 3 Years 3 5 Years 5 Years Debt obligations(1) $ 280,618 $ 277,748 $ 1,537 $ 1,127 $ 206 Operating lease obligations(2) 3,097,493 423,564 804,055 690,838 1,179,036 Purchase obligations 384,588 279,076 82,887 20,449 2,176 Total $ 3,762,699 $ 980,388 $ 888,479 $ 712,414 $ 1,181,418 (1) Debt amounts include principal maturities only. The amount due in less than one year includes $277 million of short term borrowings under the Facility. (2) Amounts include the direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses. Starbucks expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business. Off Balance Sheet Arrangement The Company has unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain Japanese yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of an unconsolidated equity investee, Starbucks Coffee Japan, Ltd. (Starbucks Japan). The guarantees continue until the loans, including accrued interest and fees, have been paid in full, with the final loan amount due in 2014. The maximum amount is limited to the sum of unpaid principal and interest amounts, as well as other related expenses. These amounts will vary based on fluctuations in the yen foreign exchange rate. As of October 2, 2005, the maximum amount of the guarantees was approximately $9.0 million. Since there has been no modification of these loan guarantees subsequent to the Companys adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indebtedness of Others, Starbucks has applied the disclosure provisions only and has not recorded the guarantees on its balance sheet. Product Warranties Coffee brewing and espresso equipment sold to customers through Company operated and licensed retail stores, as well as equipment sold to the Companys licensees for use in retail licensing operations, are under warranty for defects in materials and workmanship for a period ranging from 12 to 24 months. The Company establishes an accrual for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale, based on historical experience. The following table summarizes the activity related to product warranty reserves during fiscal 2005 and 2004 (in thousands): Fiscal Year Ended Oct 2, 2005 Oct 3, 2004 Balance at beginning of fiscal year $ 3,091 $ 2,227 Provision for warranties issued 7,494 5,093 Warranty claims (8,827 ) (4,229 ) Balance at end of fiscal year $ 1,758 $ 3,091 35 Table of Contents COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS The Company manages its exposure to various risks within the consolidated financial statements according to an umbrella risk management policy, which was approved in May 2005 by the Companys Board of Directors. Under this policy, market based risks, including commodity costs and foreign currency exchange rates, are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. Additionally, this policy restricts, among other things, the amount of market based risk the Company will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and does not allow for speculative trading activity. The Company purchases significant amounts of coffee and dairy products to support the needs of its Company operated retail stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts the Companys results of operations and can be expected to impact its future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10 K. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT The Company is exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices and changes in interest rates. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The majority of the Companys revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities is transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of the Companys operations consists of activities outside of the United States, the Company has transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, Euro and Japanese yen. Under the Companys umbrella risk management policy, the Company frequently evaluates its foreign currency exchange risk by monitoring market data and external factors that may influence exchange rate fluctuations. As a result, Starbucks may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments, with maturities generally not exceeding five years, to hedge assets, liabilities, revenues and purchases denominated in foreign currencies. As of October 2, 2005, the Company had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, to hedge a portion of anticipated international revenue and product purchases. In addition, Starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as a hedge of its net investment in Starbucks Japan. These contracts expire within 31 months. Based on the foreign exchange contracts outstanding as of October 2, 2005, a 10% devaluation of the U.S. dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates for currencies under contract as of October 2, 2005, would result in a reduced fair value of these derivative financial instruments of approximately $11.3 million, of which $4.6 million may reduce the Companys future earnings. Conversely, a 10% appreciation of the U.S. dollar would result in an increase in the fair value of these instruments of approximately $11.3 million, of which $5.8 million may increase the Companys future earnings. Consistent with the nature of the economic hedges provided by these foreign exchange contracts, increases or decreases in their fair value would be mostly offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the dollar value of the Companys foreign investment, future foreign currency royalty fee payments and product purchases that would occur within the hedging period. 36 Table of Contents Equity Security Price Risk The Company has minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds within its trading portfolio. The trading securities approximate a portion of the Companys liability under the Management Deferred Compensation Plan (MDCP). A corresponding liability is included in Accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets. These investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in Interest and other income, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The offsetting changes in the MDCP liability are recorded in General and administrative expenses. Interest Rate Risk The Companys available for sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments. The primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity. Available for sale securities are investment grade and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss). The Company does not hedge the interest rate exposure on its available for sale securities. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying interest rate of its interest bearing financial instruments, including its short term borrowings and long term debt, as of the end of fiscal 2005, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. SEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY RESULTS The Companys business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Historically, significant portions of the Companys net revenues and profits were, and may continue to be realized during the first quarter of the Companys fiscal year, which includes the December holiday season. In addition, quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores, and the Companys rapid growth may conceal the impact of other seasonal influences. Because of the seasonality of the Companys business, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results, and require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Starbucks considers its policies on impairment of long lived assets and accounting for self insurance reserves to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements. Impairment of Long Lived Assets When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets to projected future cash flows, in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses. For goodwill and other intangible assets, impairment tests are performed annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the Companys trademarks. Upon indication that the carrying values of such assets may not be 37 Table of Contents recoverable, the Company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations. Property, plant and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment. Cash flows for retail assets are identified at the individual store level. Long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Judgments made by the Company related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability of the Company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. As the Company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its long lived assets, these factors could cause the Company to realize material impairment charges. Self Insurance Reserves The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability insurance and vehicle liability. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities, portions of which are calculated by third party actuarial firms, could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS In November 2005, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 115 1, The Meaning of Other Than Temporary Impairment and Its Application to Certain Investments (FSP 115 1). FSP 115 1 provides accounting guidance for identifying and recognizing other than temporary impairments of debt and equity securities, as well as cost method investments in addition to disclosure requirements. FSP 115 1 is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2005, and earlier application is permitted. The Company has adopted this new pronouncement in its fourth quarter of fiscal 2005. The adoption of FSP 115 1 did not have an impact on the Companys consolidated financial statements. The required disclosures are presented in Notes 4 and 7 of this Report. In March 2005, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 143 (FIN 47). FIN 47 requires the recognition of a liability for the fair value of a legally required conditional asset retirement obligation when incurred, if the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated. FIN 47 also clarifies when an entity would have sufficient information to reasonably estimate the fair value of an asset retirement obligation. FIN 47 is effective for fiscal years ending after December 15, 2005, or no later than Starbucks fiscal fourth quarter of 2006. The Company has not yet determined the impact of adoption on its consolidated statement of earnings and balance sheet. In December 2004, the FASB issued SFAS No. 123R, Share Based Payment (SFAS 123R), a revision of SFAS 123. SFAS 123R will require Starbucks to, among other things, measure all employee stock based compensation awards using a fair value method and record the expense in the Companys consolidated financial statements. The provisions of SFAS 123R, as amended by SEC Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 107, Share Based Payment, are effective no later than the beginning of the next fiscal year that begins after June 15, 2005. Starbucks will adopt the new requirements using the modified prospective transition method in 38 Table of Contents its first fiscal quarter of 2006, which ends January 1, 2006. In addition to the recognition of expense in the financial statements, under SFAS 123R, any excess tax benefits received upon exercise of options will be presented as a financing activity inflow rather than as an adjustment of operating activity as currently presented. Based on its current analysis and information, management has determined that the impact of adopting SFAS 123R will result in a reduction of net earnings and expects diluted earnings per share to be reduced by approximately $0.09 on a full year basis for fiscal 2006. In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 109 1, Application of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, to the Tax Deduction on Qualified Production Activities provided by the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP 109 1). FSP 109 1 states that qualified domestic production activities should be accounted for as a special deduction under SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, and not be treated as a rate reduction. The provisions of FSP 109 1 are effective immediately. The Company will qualify for a benefit beginning in fiscal 2006, which is not expected to be material to the Companys consolidated financial statements. In December 2004, the FASB issued Staff Position No. FAS 109 2, Accounting and Disclosure Guidance for the Foreign Earnings Repatriation Provision within the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (FSP 109 2). The American Jobs Creation Act allows a special one time dividends received deduction on the repatriation of certain foreign earnings to a U.S. taxpayer (repatriation provision), provided certain criteria are met. The law allows the Company to make an election to repatriate earnings through fiscal 2006. FSP 109 2 provides accounting and disclosure guidance for the repatriation provision. Although FSP 109 2 was effective upon its issuance, it allows companies additional time beyond the enactment date to evaluate the effects of the provision on its plan for investment or repatriation of unremitted foreign earnings. The Company continues to evaluate the impact of the new Act to determine whether it will repatriate foreign earnings and the impact, if any, this pronouncement will have on its consolidated financial statements. As of October 2, 2005, the Company has not made an election to repatriate earnings under this provision. The Company may or may not elect to repatriate earnings in fiscal 2006. Earnings under consideration for repatriation range from $0 to $75 million and the related income tax effects range from $0 to $5 million. As provided in FSP 109 2, Starbucks has not adjusted its tax expense or deferred tax liability to reflect the repatriation provision. In November 2004, the FASB issued Statement No. 151, Inventory Costs, an amendment of ARB No. 43, Chapter 4 (SFAS 151).
