Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Starbucks Corporations fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. Some fiscal years include 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended on September 30, 2007, October 1, 2006 and October 2, 2005, all included 52 weeks. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures. Management Overview Fiscal 2007 The Year in Review Starbucks achieved solid performance in fiscal 2007 meeting its targets for store openings, revenue growth, comparable store sales growth, and earnings per share despite a challenging economic and operating environment, and significant cost increases from dairy. The Company completed the fiscal year with encouraging trends and momentum in its International business but faced increasing challenges in its U.S. business. While U.S. comparable store sales were within the Companys stated target range, it was accomplished through two price increases which offset flat to negative transaction count trends in the U.S. business. The pressure on traffic is consistent with similar trends reported across both the retail and restaurant industry. Management believes that the combination of the economic slowdown and the price increases implemented in fiscal 2007 to help mitigate significant cost pressures have impacted the frequency of customer visits to Starbucks stores. Consolidated net revenues for fiscal year 2007 increased 21% to $9.4 billion. Company operated retail revenues in fiscal 2007 rose 21% to $8.0 billion, predominantly due to the opening of 1,342 stores and comparable store sales growth of 5%. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in the average value per transaction and 1% growth in the number of customer transactions. The Company opened a total of 2,571 new company operated and licensed stores during the year, with 70% in the U.S. and 30% in International markets, to end the year with over 15,000 stores. For fiscal 2007, operating income increased to $1.1 billion, while operating margin contracted 30 basis points to 11.2% of total net revenues. Margin compression was due to higher costs of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues due to a shift in sales to higher cost products and higher distribution costs, rent expense and dairy costs. These cost pressures were offset in part by leveraging general and administrative expenses, store operating expenses, and other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues. Net earnings rose to $673 million in fiscal 2007 from $564 million for the previous year. Diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2007 increased to $0.87 compared to $0.71 a year ago. Excluding the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47 in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2006, earnings grew 16% and diluted earnings per share increased 19%. Fiscal 2008 The View Ahead Throughout fiscal 2007, Starbucks experienced a consistent weakening in its U.S. business, exiting the year with a negative trend in transactions. Management recognizes that it faces a more challenging environment from an economic, operational and competitive standpoint entering fiscal 2008. In response to those challenges, management intends to focus in the following key areas: Better operational excellence at the store level; More meaningful innovation to continue to differentiate the store experience; and Increased efficiencies and effectiveness in the general and administrative infrastructure, to become more capable of navigating through the fluctuations in the external environment. 20 Table of Contents In setting targets for fiscal 2008, managements goal was to balance the long term opportunity for store growth with the near term realities of the challenging economic and operating environment. For fiscal 2008 the Company is targeting: Opening approximately 2,500 new stores; Comparable store sales growth in the range of 3% to 5%; Total net revenue growth in the range of approximately 17% to 18%, to over $11 billion; and Earnings per share in the range of $1.02 to $1.05, representing 17% to 21% growth, with earnings per share expansion expected to be greater in the second half of fiscal 2008. In summary, management believes these targets are balanced for fiscal 2008. The Company intends to continue to build out stores to take advantage of its global opportunity, to better execute in its U.S. business, to grow and deliver significant margin expansion in its International business, and to deliver margin improvement for the Company on a consolidated basis. Operating Segment Overview Starbucks has three reportable operating segments: United States, International and CPG. The United States and International segments both include Company operated retail stores, licensed retail stores and foodservice operations. The United States segment has been operating significantly longer than the International segment and has developed deeper awareness of, and attachment to, the Starbucks brand and stores among its customer base. As a result, the United States segment has significantly more stores, and higher total revenues than the International segment. Average sales per store are also higher in the United States due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels. Further, certain market costs, particularly occupancy costs, are lower in the United States segment compared to the average for the International segment, which comprises a more diverse group of operations. As a result of the relative strength of the brand in the United States segment, the number of stores, the higher unit volumes, and the lower market costs, the United States segment has a higher operating margin than the less developed International segment. The Companys International store base continues to increase rapidly and Starbucks is achieving a growing contribution from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets, such as China, Brazil and Russia. The Companys newer international markets require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income. The CPG segment includes the Companys grocery and warehouse club business as well as branded products operations worldwide. The CPG segment operates primarily through joint ventures and licensing arrangements with large consumer products business partners, most significantly The North American Coffee Partnership with the Pepsi Cola Company for distribution of ready to drink beverages, and with Kraft Foods Inc. for distribution of packaged coffees and teas. This operating model allows the CPG segment to leverage the business partners existing infrastructures and to extend the Starbucks brand in an efficient way. Most of the customer revenues from the ready to drink and packaged coffee channels are recognized as revenues by the joint venture or licensed business partner, not by the CPG segment, and the proportionate share of the results of the Companys joint ventures are included on a net basis in Income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings. As a result, the CPG segment reflects relatively lower revenues, a modest cost structure, and a resulting higher operating margin, compared to the Companys other two reporting segments, which consist primarily of retail stores. Expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. These unallocated corporate expenses include certain general and administrative expenses, related depreciation and amortization expenses and amounts included in Net interest and other income on the consolidated statements of earnings. 21 Table of Contents Acquisitions In the first quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company purchased a 90% stake in its previously licensed operations in Beijing, China. Due to its majority ownership of these operations, Starbucks applied the consolidation method of accounting subsequent to the date of acquisition. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2006 The following table presents the consolidated statement of earnings as well as the percentage relationship to total net revenues, unless otherwise indicated, of items included in the Companys consolidated statements of earnings (amounts in thousands): Sept 30, % of Oct 1, % of Oct 2, % of Fiscal Year Ended 2007 Revenues 2006 Revenues 2005 Revenues STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS DATA Net revenues: Company operated retail $ 7,998,265 85.0 % $ 6,583,098 84.5 % $ 5,391,927 84.7 % Specialty: Licensing 1,026,338 10.9 860,676 11.1 673,015 10.5 Foodservice and other 386,894 4.1 343,168 4.4 304,358 4.8 Total specialty 1,413,232 15.0 1,203,844 15.5 977,373 15.3 Total net revenues 9,411,497 100.0 7,786,942 100.0 6,369,300 100.0 Cost of sales including occupancy costs 3,999,124 42.5 3,178,791 40.8 2,605,212 40.9 Store operating expenses(1) 3,215,889 34.2 2,687,815 34.5 2,165,911 34.0 Other operating expenses(2) 294,136 3.1 253,724 3.3 192,525 3.0 Depreciation and amortization expenses 467,160 4.9 387,211 5.0 340,169 5.3 General and administrative expenses 489,249 5.2 479,386 6.1 361,613 5.7 Total operating expenses 8,465,558 89.9 6,986,927 89.7 5,665,430 88.9 Income from equity investees 108,006 1.1 93,937 1.2 76,648 1.2 Operating income 1,053,945 11.2 893,952 11.5 780,518 12.3 Net interest and other income 2,419 12,291 0.1 15,829 0.2 Earnings before income taxes 1,056,364 11.2 906,243 11.6 796,347 12.5 Income taxes 383,726 4.1 324,770 4.1 301,977 4.7 Earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle 672,638 7.1 581,473 7.5 494,370 7.8 Cumulative effect of accounting change for FIN 47, net of taxes 17,214 0.3 Net earnings $ 672,638 7.1 % $ 564,259 7.2 % $ 494,370 7.8 % (1) As a percentage of related Company operated retail revenues, store operating expenses were 40.2%, 40.8% and 40.2% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007, October 1, 2006 and October 2, 2005, respectively. (2) As a percentage of related total specialty revenues, other operating expenses were 20.8%, 21.1% and 19.7% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007, October 1, 2006 and October 2, 2005, respectively. 22 Table of Contents Consolidated Results of Operations Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2007, increased 21% to $9.4 billion from $7.8 billion for fiscal 2006, driven by increases in both Company operated retail revenues and specialty operations. During the fiscal year ended 2007, Starbucks derived 85% of total net revenues from its Company operated retail stores. Company operated retail revenues increased 21% to $8.0 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, from $6.6 billion for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to the opening of 1,342 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 5% for the fiscal year ended 2007. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in the average value per transaction and a 1% increase in the number of customer transactions. The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company operated retail stores, collectively known as specialty operations. Specialty revenues, which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other revenues, increased 17% to $1.4 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, from $1.2 billion for fiscal 2006. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements as well as grocery, warehouse club and certain other branded product operations, increased 19% to $1.0 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, from $861 million for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 1,229 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and a 20% increase in licensing revenues from the Companys CPG business. Foodservice and other revenues increased 13% to $387 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, from $343 million for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily attributable to growth in new and existing accounts in the U.S. foodservice business. Cost of sales including occupancy costs increased to 42.5% of total net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to 40.8% for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to a shift in sales mix to higher cost products, the rise in distribution costs, higher rent expense and higher dairy costs. Dairy expense for the U.S. segment represents approximately 75% of the total Companys dairy expense. For the U.S. segment the average dairy costs per gallon rose 10% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, resulting in approximately $20 million of additional expense. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company operated retail revenues decreased to 40.2% for the fiscal year ended 2007, from 40.8% for fiscal 2006, primarily due to higher provisions for incentive compensation in the prior year due to exceptionally strong performance as well as leverage on regional overhead costs in fiscal 2007. Other operating expenses (expenses associated with the Companys Specialty Operations) decreased to 20.8% of total specialty revenues for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to 21.1% in fiscal 2006. The decline resulted primarily from controlled discretionary spending in fiscal 2007. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $467 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $387 million for the corresponding period of fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 1,342 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to 4.9% for the fiscal 2007, compared to 5.0% for fiscal 2006. General and administrative expenses increased to $489 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $479 million for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher payroll related expenditures in support of continued global growth, offset in part by unusually high charitable contributions in fiscal 2006. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses decreased to 5.2% for the fiscal year ended 2007, from 6.1% for fiscal 2006. Income from equity investees increased 15% to $108 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $94 million for fiscal 2006, primarily due to higher equity income from international investees. Operating income increased 18% to $1.1 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $894 million for fiscal 2006. Operating margin decreased to 11.2% of total net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2007, from 11.5% for fiscal 2006. Margin compression was due to higher costs of sales and occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues due to a shift in sales to higher cost products and higher distribution costs, rent expense and dairy costs. 23 Table of Contents These cost pressures were offset in part by leveraging general and administrative expenses, store operating expenses, and other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues. Net interest and other income was $2 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $12 million for fiscal 2006. The decrease was primarily due to increased interest expense resulting from a higher level of borrowings outstanding, which include the $550 million of senior notes issued in August 2007, offset in part by a higher amount of income recognized on unredeemed stored value card and gift certificate balances in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006. Income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2007 resulted in an effective tax rate of 36.3%, compared to 35.8% for fiscal 2006. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2008 is expected to be approximately in line with fiscal 2007, with quarterly variations. Net earnings for the fiscal year ended 2007, increased 19% to $673 million from $564 million for fiscal 2006. Diluted earnings per share increased to $0.87 for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $0.71 per share for fiscal 2006. Excluding the cumulative effect of adopting FIN 47 in fourth quarter 2006, earnings before cumulative effect of change in accounting principle grew 16% and diluted earnings per share increased 19%. Operating Segments Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the Companys management reviews financial information for operational decision making purposes. Starbucks has three reportable operating segments: United States, International and CPG. Unallocated Corporate includes expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. Operating income represents earnings before Net interest and other income and Income taxes. The following tables summarize the Companys results of operations by segment for fiscal 2007 and 2006 (in thousands): United States 52 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended Sept 30, Oct 1, % Sept 30, Oct 1, 2007 2006 Change 2007 2006 As a % of U.S. total net revenues Net revenues: Company operated retail $ 6,560,864 $ 5,495,240 19.4 % 89.3 % 88.9 % Specialty: Licensing 439,161 369,155 19.0 6.0 6.0 Foodservice and other 348,968 314,162 11.1 4.7 5.1 Total specialty 788,129 683,317 15.3 10.7 11.1 Total net revenues 7,348,993 6,178,557 18.9 100.0 100.0 Cost of sales including occupancy costs 2,956,231 2,374,485 24.5 40.2 38.4 Store operating expenses(1) 2,684,196 2,280,044 17.7 36.5 36.9 Other operating expenses(2) 204,672 190,624 7.4 2.8 3.1 Depreciation and amortization expenses 348,199 284,625 22.3 4.7 4.6 General and administrative expenses 85,948 93,754 (8.3 ) 1.2 1.5 Total operating expenses 6,279,246 5,223,532 20.2 85.4 84.5 Income from equity investees 768 151 nm Operating income $ 1,070,515 $ 955,176 12.1 % 14.6 % 15.5 % (1) As a percentage of related Company operated retail revenues, store operating expenses were 40.9% and 41.5% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006, respectively. 24 Table of Contents (2) As a percentage of related total specialty revenues, other operating expenses were 26.0% and 27.9% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006, respectively. The United States operating segment (United States) sells coffee and other beverages, complementary food, whole bean coffees, and coffee brewing equipment and merchandise primarily through Company operated retail stores. Specialty operations within the United States include licensed retail stores, foodservice accounts and other initiatives related to the Companys core business. United States total net revenues increased 19% to $7.3 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $6.2 billion for fiscal 2006. United States Company operated retail revenues increased 19% to $6.6 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $5.5 billion for fiscal 2006, primarily due to the opening of 1,065 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 4% for fiscal 2007, nearly all resulting from an increase in the average value per transaction. The U.S. Company operated retail business experienced deteriorating trends in transactions late in the year, driven by, management believes, the U.S. economic slowdown combined with two price increases in U.S. retail stores implemented in fiscal 2007. Management believes that several initiatives underway in the U.S. business, namely an enhanced focus on operational excellence in the stores, a more robust marketing strategy, meaningful product innovation and a renewed focus on the core beverage and coffeehouse experience, will help address those challenges in the U.S. retail business. In addition, in fiscal 2008 the Company plans to slightly reduce the pace of new store openings in the U.S. from the previous year in order to ensure the selection of store location and store format are the best fit for its customers and the business. Total United States specialty revenues increased 15% to $788 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $683 million in fiscal 2006. United States licensing revenues increased 19% to $439 million, compared to $369 million for fiscal 2006 primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 723 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. United States foodservice and other revenues increased 11% to $349 million, from $314 million in fiscal 2006, primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts. United States operating income increased 12% to $1.1 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $955 million for fiscal 2006. Operating margin decreased to 14.6% of related revenues from 15.5% in fiscal 2006. The decrease was due to higher cost of sales including occupancy costs, primarily due to a shift in sales mix to higher cost products such as food and merchandise, higher distribution costs, higher rent expense and higher dairy costs. Partially offsetting these were lower store operating expenses, lower general and administrative expenses, and lower other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues. The decline in store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to higher provisions for incentive compensation in the prior year as well as leverage on regional overhead costs in fiscal 2007. General and administrative expenses were lower primarily due to decreased salary and related benefits expense as well as lower professional fees. The decline in other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to controlled discretionary spending in the current year. 25 Table of Contents International 52 Weeks Ended 52 Weeks Ended Sept 30, Oct 1, % Sept 30, Oct 1, 2007 2006 Change 2007 2006 As a % of international total net revenues Net revenues: Company operated retail $ 1,437,401 $ 1,087,858 32.1 % 84.7 % 83.5 % Specialty: Licensing 220,832 186,050 18.7 13.0 14.3 Foodservice and other 37,926 29,006 30.8 2.3 2.2 Total specialty 258,758 215,056 20.3 15.3 16.5 Total net revenues 1,696,159 1,302,914 30.2 100.0 100.0 Cost of sales including occupancy costs 824,594 625,008 31.9 48.6 48.0 Store operating expenses(1) 531,693 407,771 30.4 31.4 31.3 Other operating expenses(2) 69,881 50,900 37.3 4.1 3.9 Depreciation and amortization expenses 84,165 66,800 26.0 5.0 5.1 General and administrative expenses 93,806 78,337 19.7 5.5 6.0 Total operating expenses 1,604,139 1,228,816 30.5 94.6 94.3 Income from equity investees 45,723 34,370 33.0 2.7 2.6 Operating income $ 137,743 $ 108,468 27.0 % 8.1 % 8.3 % (1) As a percentage of related Company operated retail revenues, store operating expenses were 37.0% and 37.5% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006, respectively. (2) As a percentage of related total specialty revenues, other operating expenses were 27.0% and 23.7% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006, respectively. The International operating segment (International) sells coffee and other beverages, complementary food, whole bean coffees, and coffee brewing equipment and merchandise through Company operated retail stores in Canada, the UK and eight other markets. Specialty operations in International primarily include retail store licensing operations in more than 30 other countries and foodservice accounts, primarily in Canada and the UK. The Companys International store base continues to increase rapidly and Starbucks is achieving a growing contribution from established areas of the business while at the same time investing in emerging markets and channels. Many of the Companys International operations are in early stages of development that require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income, than in the United States. This continuing investment is part of the Companys long term, balanced plan for profitable growth. International total net revenues increased 30% to $1.7 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2006. International Company operated retail revenues increased 32% to $1.4 billion for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $1.1 billion for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to the opening of 277 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months, comparable store sales growth of 7% for fiscal 2007 and favorable foreign currency exchange for the British pound sterling. The increase in comparable store sales resulted from a 5% increase in the number of customer transactions coupled with a 2% increase in the average value per transaction. Total International specialty revenues increased 20% to $259 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $215 million in fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 506 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. 26 Table of Contents International operating income increased 27% to $138 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $108 million in fiscal 2006. Operating margin decreased to 8.1% of related revenues from 8.3% in fiscal 2006, primarily due to higher cost of sales including occupancy costs due in part to a shift in sales mix to higher cost products such as food and merchandise and higher distribution costs. Partially offsetting this increase was lower general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total net revenues.

CPG also produces and sells ready to drink beverages through its joint ventures and marketing and distribution agreements. CPG General and administrative expenses, previously included in Other operating expenses, are now presented separately. CPG total net revenues increased 20% to $366 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $305 million for fiscal 2006. The increase was primarily due to increased sales of U.S. packaged coffee and tea as well as increased product sales and royalties in the international ready to drink business. CPG operating income increased by 10% to $184 million for the fiscal year ended 2007, compared to $167 million in fiscal 2006. Operating margin decreased to 50.1% of related revenues, from 54.6% in fiscal 2006. Contraction of operating margin was primarily due to slower growth in income from the North American Coffee Partnership, an equity investee, which produces ready to drink beverages.

Unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of total net revenues decreased to 3.6% for the fiscal year ended 2007, from 4.3% for fiscal 2006, primarily as a result of leveraging of the Companys scale and infrastructure against global growth. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2005 Consolidated Results of Operations Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2006 increased 22% to $7.8 billion from $6.4 billion for fiscal 2005, driven by increases in both Company operated retail revenues and specialty operations. During the fiscal year ended 2006, Starbucks derived 85% of total net revenues from its Company operated retail stores. Company operated retail revenues increased 22% to $6.6 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, from $5.4 billion for fiscal 2005. This increase was primarily due to the opening of 1,043 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 7% in fiscal 2006. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 5% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 2% increase in the average value per transaction. The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company operated retail stores. Specialty revenues, which include licensing revenues and foodservice and other revenues, increased 23% to $1.2 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, from $977 million for fiscal 2005. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements, as well as grocery, warehouse club and certain other branded product operations, increased 28% to $861 million for fiscal 2006, from $673 million for fiscal 2005. The increase is primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 1,156 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and, to a lesser extent, growth in the licensed grocery and warehouse club business. Foodservice and other revenues increased 13% to $343 million for fiscal 2006, from $304 million for fiscal 2005. Foodservice and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in new and existing U.S. foodservice accounts. Cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased slightly to 40.8% of total net revenues for fiscal 2006, from 40.9% in fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily due to fixed rent costs in fiscal 2006 being distributed over an expanded revenue base, as well as increased occupancy costs in fiscal 2005 resulting from intensified store maintenance activities. These favorable items, combined with lower dairy costs, offset higher green coffee costs for fiscal 2006. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company operated retail revenues increased to 40.8% for fiscal 2006 from 40.2% for fiscal 2005. The increase was due to the recognition of stock based compensation expense and to higher provisions for incentive compensation. The Company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of new accounting requirements to expense stock based compensation at the beginning of its fiscal first quarter of 2006. Under the transition provisions allowed, it adopted the new requirements on a prospective basis and the financial statements for fiscal 2005 and prior years do not include stock based compensation expense. Other operating expenses, which are expenses associated with the Companys Specialty Operations, increased to 21.1% of specialty revenues in fiscal 2006, compared to 19.7% in fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to the recognition of stock based compensation expense as well as higher payroll related expenditures to support the expanding licensed store operations, both in the U.S. and in existing and new international markets. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased to $387 million in fiscal 2006, from $340 million in fiscal 2005. The increase of $47 million was due to the opening of 1,043 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months. As a percentage of total net revenues, depreciation and amortization decreased to 5.0% for fiscal 2006, from 5.3% for fiscal 2005. General and administrative expenses increased to $479 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $362 million in fiscal 2005. The increase was due to higher payroll related expenditures from the recognition of stock based compensation expense, additional employees to support continued global growth, and higher professional fees in support of global systems infrastructure development. As a percentage of total net revenues, general and administrative expenses increased to 6.1% for fiscal 2006, from 5.7% for fiscal 2005. 28 Table of Contents Income from equity investees increased to $94 million in fiscal 2006, compared to $77 million in fiscal 2005. The increase was primarily due to favorable volume driven operating results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces ready to drink beverages which include, among others, bottled Frappuccino coffee drinks and Starbucks DoubleShot espresso drinks, as well as improved operating results from international investees, including Korea and Japan, mainly as a result of new store openings. Operating income increased 15% to $894 million in fiscal 2006, from $781 million in fiscal 2005. The operating margin decreased to 11.5% of total net revenues in fiscal 2006, compared to 12.3% in fiscal 2005, due to the recognition of stock based compensation expense. Net interest and other income, which primarily consists of interest income, decreased to $12 million in fiscal 2006, from $16 million in fiscal 2005. The decrease was primarily due to higher interest expense on the Companys revolving credit facility, as well as lower interest income earned due to lower average investment balances, offset in part by the recognition of $4.4 million of income on unredeemed stored value card balances in fiscal 2006. There was no income recognized on unredeemed stored value card balances in fiscal 2005. Income taxes for fiscal 2006 resulted in an effective tax rate of 35.8%, compared to 37.9% in fiscal 2005. The decline in the effective tax rate was due to the reversal of a valuation allowance in fiscal 2006 that had been established in fiscal 2005, the settlement in the third quarter of fiscal 2006 of a multi year income tax audit in a foreign jurisdiction for which the Company had established a contingent liability, and to increased effectiveness of the Companys long term tax planning strategies. Operating Segments Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the Companys management reviews financial information for operational decision making purposes.

United States total net revenues increased 21% to $6.2 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $5.1 billion for fiscal 2005. United States Company operated retail revenues increased 21% to $5.5 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $4.5 billion for fiscal 2005. United States Company operated retail revenues increased primarily due to the opening of 810 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 7% for fiscal 2006. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 5% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 2% increase in the average value per transaction. Total United States specialty revenues increased 22% to $683 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $558 million in fiscal 2005. United States licensing revenues increased 33% to $369 million, compared to $278 million for fiscal 2005. United States licensing revenues increased due to increased product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 733 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased 12% to $314 million from $280 million for fiscal 2005. United States foodservice and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts. United States operating income increased 17% to $955 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, from $819 million for the fiscal year ended 2005. Operating margin decreased to 15.5% of related revenues from 16.1% in fiscal 2005. The decrease was due to the recognition of stock based compensation expense.

International total net revenues increased 27% to $1.3 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $1.0 billion for fiscal 2005. International Company operated retail revenues increased 28% to $1.1 billion for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $852 million for fiscal 2005. International Company operated revenues increased due to the opening of 233 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months, comparable store sales growth of 8% for fiscal 2006, and the weakening of the U.S. dollar against the Canadian dollar. The increase in comparable store sales resulted from a 5% increase in the number of customer transactions and a 3% increase in the average value per transaction. Total International specialty revenues increased 26% to $215 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $170 million for fiscal 2005. International licensing revenues increased 28% to $186 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $146 million in fiscal 2005. International licensing revenues increased due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 423 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. International foodservice and other revenues increased 19% to $29 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $24 million in fiscal 2005. International foodservice and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in the total number of foodservice accounts. International operating income increased to $108 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $82 million in fiscal 2005. Operating margin increased to 8.3% of related revenues from 8.0% in fiscal 2005, primarily due to lower cost of sales including occupancy costs due to leverage gained from fixed costs distributed over an expanded revenue base, as well as lower dairy costs. These improvements were partially offset by higher store operating expenses and other operating expenses due to higher payroll related expenditures primarily to support global expansion as well as the recognition of stock based compensation expense.

CPG operating income increased to $167 million for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to $131 million for fiscal 2005. Operating margin increased to 54.6% of related revenues, from 52.7% in fiscal 2005, primarily due to higher income from the Companys equity investees and lower cost of sales as a percentage of revenues. The increase in equity investee income was primarily due to volume driven results for The North American Coffee Partnership, which produces ready to drink beverages which include, among others, bottled Frappuccino beverages and 31 Table of Contents Starbucks DoubleShot espresso drinks. Lower cost of sales was due to a sales mix shift to products with higher gross margins.

The increase was due to higher payroll related expenditures from the recognition of stock based compensation expense and to additional employees, as well as higher professional fees primarily in support of global systems infrastructure development. Total unallocated corporate expenses as a percentage of total net revenues were 4.3% for the fiscal year ended 2006, compared to 3.9% for fiscal 2005. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The primary sources of the Companys liquidity are cash flows generated from retail store operations and other business channels, borrowings under available commercial paper programs and credit agreements, proceeds from the issuance of long term debt securities and the Companys existing cash and liquid investments, which were $460 million and $459 million as of September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006, respectively. Components of the Companys most liquid assets are as follows (in thousands): Sept 30, Oct 1, Fiscal Year Ended 2007 2006 Cash and cash equivalents $ 281,261 $ 312,606 Short term investments available for sale securities 83,845 87,542 Short term investments trading securities 73,588 53,496 Long term investments available for sale securities 21,022 5,811 Total cash and liquid investments $ 459,716 $ 459,455 In order to hedge its liability under its Management Deferred Compensation Plan (MDCP), the Company maintains a portfolio of unrestricted trading securities, the value of which was $74 million as of September 30, 2007. In addition, unrestricted cash and liquid securities held within the Companys wholly owned captive insurance company to fund claim payouts totaled approximately $98 million as of September 30, 2007. The Company manages the balance of its cash and liquid investments in order to internally fund operating needs and make scheduled payments on short term borrowings. In determining the appropriate capital structure for the Company, management considers, among other things, how debt may reduce its total cost of capital when used to fund increased distributions to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases. The Company also evaluates its degree of cash flow risk and how much financial flexibility should be retained for future investment opportunities given its high growth rate. The Companys key metrics for monitoring its capital structure are leverage, measured as the ratio of debt to EBITDA, and coverage, measured as the ratio of EBITDA to interest expense including rent expense. Both ratios are adjusted to capitalize operating leases. The credit rating agencies, Moodys and Standard Poors, currently rate the Companys commercial paper P 2 and A 2, respectively, and its long term debt Baa1 and BBB+, respectively. The Company intends to use its cash and liquid investments, including any borrowings under its revolving credit facility, commercial paper program and proceeds from the issuance of long term debt securities, to invest in its core businesses and other new business opportunities related to its core businesses. The Company may use its available 32 Table of Contents cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to its equity method and cost method investees, as well as purchase larger ownership interests in selected equity method investees and licensed operations, particularly in international markets. Depending on market conditions, Starbucks may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. Management believes that strong cash flow generated from operations, existing cash and liquid investments, as well as borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, should be sufficient to finance capital requirements for its core businesses for the foreseeable future. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions, share repurchases and or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2008 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for new Company operated retail stores and the remodeling and refurbishment of existing Company operated retail stores, as well as potential increased investments in International licensees and for additional share repurchases, if any. Management expects capital expenditures for fiscal 2008 to be consistent with the $1.1 billion invested in fiscal 2007, primarily driven by new store development and existing store renovations. Cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.3 billion for fiscal 2007. Of this amount, net earnings provided $673 million and noncash depreciation and amortization expenses further increased cash provided by operating activities by $491 million. In addition, an increase in accrued taxes payable due to the timing of payments provided $86 million. Cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2007 totaled $1.2 billion. Net capital additions to property, plant and equipment used $1.1 billion, primarily from opening 1,342 new Company operated retail stores and remodeling certain existing stores. During fiscal 2007, the Company used $53 million for acquisitions, net of cash acquired. In addition, the net activity in the Companys portfolio of available for sale securities used $12 million. Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2007 totaled $172 million. Cash used to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock totaled $997 million. This amount includes the effect of the net change in unsettled trades from October 1, 2006. Share repurchases, up to the limit authorized by the Board of Directors, are at the discretion of management and depend on market conditions, capital requirements and other factors. As of September 30, 2007, a total of up to 13.5 million shares remained available for repurchase, under existing authorizations. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, the Company issued $550 million of 6.25% Senior Notes due in August 2017, in an underwritten registered public offering. The proceeds of $549 million, before expenses, were primarily used to repay short term borrowings and fund additional share repurchases. Net new borrowings under the Companys credit facility and commercial paper program were $10 million for fiscal 2007. As of September 30, 2007, a total of $710 million in borrowings were outstanding under the commercial paper program and $13 million in letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility, leaving $275 million of capacity available under the $1 billion combined commercial paper program and revolving credit facility. Partially offsetting cash used for share repurchases were proceeds of $177 million from the exercise of employee stock options and the sale of the Companys common stock from employee stock purchase plans. As options granted are exercised, the Company will continue to receive proceeds and a tax deduction; however, the amounts and the timing cannot be predicted. 33 Table of Contents The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and borrowings as of September 30, 2007, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on the Companys liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in thousands): Payments Due by Period Less Than 1 1 3 3 5 More Than 5 Contractual Obligations Total Year Years Years Years Debt obligations(1) $ 1,607,845 $ 747,268 $ 69,896 $ 68,806 $ 721,875 Operating lease obligations(2) 5,016,583 691,011 1,300,776 1,109,193 1,915,603 Purchase obligations(3) 427,306 267,743 141,611 13,426 4,526 Other obligations(4) 57,594 1,181 17,159 4,741 34,513 Total $ 7,109,328 $ 1,707,203 $ 1,529,442 $ 1,196,166 $ 2,676,517 (1) Debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments on commercial paper and long term debt. (2) Amounts include the direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses. (3) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Purchase obligations relate primarily to green coffee and other commodities. (4) Other obligations include other long term liabilities primarily consisting of asset retirement obligations, hedging instruments and capital lease obligations. Starbucks expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business, as well as ongoing borrowings under the commercial paper program. Off Balance Sheet Arrangement The Company has unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain Japanese yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of an unconsolidated equity investee, Starbucks Coffee Japan, Ltd. (Starbucks Japan). The guarantees continue until the loans, including accrued interest and fees, have been paid in full, with the final loan amount due in 2014. The maximum amount is limited to the sum of unpaid principal and interest amounts, as well as other related expenses. These amounts will vary based on fluctuations in the yen foreign exchange rate. As of September 30, 2007, the maximum amount of the guarantees was approximately $4.9 million. Since there has been no modification of these loan guarantees subsequent to the Companys adoption of Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Interpretation No. 45, Guarantors Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others, Starbucks has applied the disclosure provisions only and has not recorded the guarantees on its consolidated balance sheet. COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS Commodity price risk represents the Companys primary market risk, generated by its purchases of green coffee and dairy products. The Company purchases, roasts and sells high quality whole bean coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, the Company also purchases significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of its Company operated retail stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts the Companys results of operations and can be expected to impact its future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this Form 10 K. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices, and interest rates. The Company manages its exposure to various market based risks according to an umbrella risk management policy. Under this policy, market based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The umbrella risk management policy governs the 34 Table of Contents hedging instruments the business may use and limits the dollar risk to net earnings. The Company also monitors and limits the amount of associated counterparty credit risk. Additionally, this policy restricts, among other things, the amount of market based risk the Company will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading activity. In general, hedge instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years. The sensitivity analyses performed below provide only a limited, point in time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses. Commodity Price Risk The Company purchases commodity inputs, including coffee and dairy products that are used in its operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact its financial results. In addition to fixed priced contracts and price to be fixed contracts for coffee purchases, the Company may enter into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying commodity prices of its commodity hedges, as of the end of fiscal 2007, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The majority of the Companys revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in U.S. dollars. However, because a portion of the Companys operations consists of activities outside of the United States, the Company has transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, euro, and Japanese yen. As a result, Starbucks may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues, inventory purchases, assets, and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As of September 30, 2007, the Company had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as cash flow hedges under Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) No. 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended and interpreted, to hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases. In addition, Starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of its net investment in Starbucks Japan, as well as the Companys net investments in its Canadian, UK, and Chinese subsidiaries, to minimize foreign currency exposure. These contracts expire within 30 months. The Company also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes (free standing derivatives), but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables. Increases or decreases in the fair value of these hedges are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the U.S. dollar value of the Companys foreign currency denominated payables and receivables (i.e. hedged items) that would occur within the hedging period. The following table summarizes the potential impact to the Companys future net earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI) from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions): September 30, 2007 Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase in 10% Decrease in 10% Increase in 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Foreign currency hedges $ 38 (34 ) 18 (22 ) Equity Security Price Risk The Company has minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds within its trading portfolio. The trading securities approximate a portion of the Companys liability under the MDCP. A corresponding liability is included in Accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets. These investments are 35 Table of Contents recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in Net interest and other income in the consolidated statements of earnings. The offsetting changes in the MDCP liability are recorded in General and administrative expenses. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of its investments, as of the end of fiscal 2007, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. Interest Rate Risk The Company utilizes short and long term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on its existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt. At the end of fiscal years 2007 and 2006, the Company did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding. During the fiscal fourth quarter of 2007, the Company had Treasury interest rate contracts in place to mitigate a portion of the interest rate risk associated with the $550 million Senior Notes issued in August 2007. These contracts were dedesignated and settled at closing of the debt offering. The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates on the fair value of the Companys debt (in millions): September 30, 2007 Change in Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase in 100 Basis Point Decrease in Fair Value Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Debt $ 1,269 (41 ) 41 The Companys available for sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments. The primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity. Available for sale securities are investment grade and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company does not hedge the interest rate exposure on its available for sale securities. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of its available for sale securities, as of the end of fiscal 2007, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. SEASONALITY AND QUARTERLY RESULTS The Companys business is subject to seasonal fluctuations, including fluctuations resulting from the holiday season. The Companys cash flows from operations are considerably higher in the fiscal first quarter than the remainder of the year. This is largely driven by cash received as Starbucks Cards are purchased and loaded during the holiday season. Since revenues from the Starbucks Card are recognized upon redemption and not when purchased, seasonal fluctuations on the consolidated statements of earnings are much less pronounced. Quarterly results are affected by the timing of the opening of new stores, and the Companys growth may conceal the impact of other seasonal influences. For these reasons, results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be achieved for the full fiscal year. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results, and require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Starbucks considers its policies on impairment of long lived assets, stock based compensation, operating leases, self insurance reserves and income taxes to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements. 36 Table of Contents Impairment of Long Lived Assets When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets to projected future cash flows, in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses. For goodwill and other intangible assets, impairment tests are performed annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the Companys trademarks. Upon indication that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable, the Company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations. Property, plant and equipment assets are grouped at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows when assessing impairment. Cash flows for retail assets are identified at the individual store level. Long lived assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value, less estimated costs to sell. Judgments made by the Company related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability of the Company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. As the Company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its long lived assets, these factors could cause the Company to realize material impairment charges. Stock based Compensation Starbucks accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. The Company uses the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them (expected term), the estimated volatility of the Companys common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures). Changes in the subjective assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation; however based on an analysis using changes in certain assumptions that could be reasonably possible in the near term, management believes the effect on the expense recognized for fiscal 2007 would not have been material. Operating Leases Starbucks leases retail stores, roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases. The Company provides for an estimate of asset retirement obligation (ARO) expense at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term. Estimating AROs involves subjective assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs. Future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated. In addition, the large number of operating leases and the significant number of international markets in which the Company has operating leases adds administrative complexity to the calculation of ARO expense, as well as to the other technical accounting requirements of operating leases such as contingent rent. Self Insurance Reserves The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability insurance and vehicle liability. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes Starbucks accounts for income taxes in accordance with Statement of SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement 37 Table of Contents carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. These include establishing a valuation allowance related to the realizability of certain deferred tax assets, and contingent tax liabilities provided for the possibility of unfavorable outcomes in certain tax positions. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 2006, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48), which seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with the accounting and reporting for uncertainty in income tax positions. This Interpretation prescribes a comprehensive model for the financial statement recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. FIN 48 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2006, and the Company will adopt the new requirements in its first fiscal quarter of 2008. The cumulative effect of adopting FIN 48 will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The Company expects that the effect of adopting FIN 48 will result in an immaterial adjustment to fiscal year 2008 opening retained earnings. In September 2006, the FASB issued SFAS No. 157, Fair Value Measurements (SFAS 157), which defines fair value, establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements. SFAS 157 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, and interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. Starbucks must adopt these new requirements no later than its first fiscal quarter of 2009. Starbucks has not yet determined the effect on the Companys consolidated financial statements, if any, upon adoption of SFAS 157, or if it will adopt the requirements prior to the first fiscal quarter of 2009. In September 2006, the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 108, Considering the Effects of Prior Year Misstatements when Quantifying Misstatements in Current Year Financial Statements (SAB 108). The intent of SAB 108 is to reduce diversity in practice for the method companies use to quantify financial statement misstatements, including the effect of prior year uncorrected errors. SAB 108 establishes an approach that requires quantification of financial statement errors using both an income statement and cumulative balance sheet approach. SAB 108 was effective for annual financial statements for fiscal years ending after November 15, 2006, and the Company adopted the new requirements in fiscal 2007 with no impact to its consolidated financial statements. In February 2007, the FASB issued SFAS No. 159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (SFAS 159). SFAS 159 permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value. SFAS 159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November 15, 2007, or Starbucks first fiscal quarter of 2009. Early adoption is permitted. Starbucks has not yet determined if it will elect to apply any of the provisions of SFAS 159 or what the effect of adoption of the statement would have, if any, on its consolidated financial statements.
