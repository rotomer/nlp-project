Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Starbucks Corporations fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. Some fiscal years include 53 weeks. The fiscal years ended on September 28, 2008, September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006 all included 52 weeks. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. Management Overview Fiscal 2008 The Year in Review Throughout fiscal 2008, Starbucks continued to experience declining comparable store sales in its US stores, primarily due to lower customer traffic. With the US segment representing 76% of consolidated revenues, the impact of this decline on the Companys financial results for fiscal 2008 was significant. For fiscal year 2008 comparable store sales declined 5% in the US, with a declining trend over the course of the year, ending with a decline of 8% in the fourth quarter. The Company also experienced declining comparable sales in Canada and the UK, its two largest Company operated International markets, primarily due to lower traffic. The Company believes that the weaker traffic has been caused by a number of ongoing factors in the global economies that have negatively impacted consumers discretionary spending, as well as factors within the Companys control with respect to the pace of store openings in the US and store level execution. In the US, the economic factors included the higher cost of such basic consumer staples as gas and food, rising levels of unemployment and personal debt, reduced access to consumer credit, and lower home values as well as increased foreclosure activity in certain areas of the country (California and Florida) where Starbucks has a high concentration of Company operated stores. These developments combined with recent and ongoing unprecedented shocks to the global financial system and capital markets have all contributed to sharp declines in consumer confidence in the US. Starbucks business is highly sensitive to increases and decreases in customer traffic. Increased customer visits create sales leverage, meaning that fixed expenses, such as occupancy costs, are spread across a greater revenue base, thereby improving operating margins. But the reverse is also true sales de leveraging creates downward pressure on margins. The softness in US revenues during fiscal 2008 impacted nearly all consolidated and US segment operating expense line items when viewed as a percentage of sales. Since January 2008, when Company founder Howard Schultz reassumed the role of president and chief executive officer in addition to his role as chairman, Starbucks has taken steps to address the deterioration in the US retail environment and address its global support structure. These included the development and implementation of several important strategic initiatives as part of a transformation strategy designed to reinvigorate the Starbucks Experience for the Companys customers, increase customer traffic in its US stores, reduce infrastructure expenses, and improve the Companys results of operations. These significant actions have been designed to structure the Companys business for long term profitable growth. As a result of the continued weak economy and decreased customer traffic, as well as the costs associated with the store closures and other actions in its transformation strategy, the Companys fiscal 2008 results were negatively impacted in the following ways: Consolidated operating income was $503.9 million in fiscal 2008, and operating margin for the year was 4.9% compared with 11.2% in the prior year. Approximately 260 basis points of the decrease in operating margin was a result of restructuring charges, primarily related to the significant US store closures. Softness in US revenues along with higher cost of sales including occupancy costs and store operating expenses were also significant drivers in the margin decline. EPS for fiscal 2008 was $0.43, compared to EPS of $0.87 per share earned in the prior year. Restructuring charges and costs associated with the execution of the transformation agenda impacted EPS by approximately $0.28 per share in fiscal 2008. 22 Table of Contents Significant Actions Taken in Fiscal 2008 The more significant actions taken by Starbucks in fiscal 2008 to transform and reinvigorate its business included: A plan to close approximately 600 underperforming Company operated stores in the US market, of which 205 were closed as of fiscal year end with the remaining stores to be closed by the end of fiscal 2009; Restructuring the Companys Australia business by closing 61 Company operated stores, focusing on the remaining 23 stores in three key metro areas; Reducing approximately 1,000 open and filled positions within the Companys leadership structure and its non store organization, to rationalize its infrastructure for the reduced number of stores; and Introducing new beverage platforms designed to reinvigorate the Starbucks beverage offerings, new breakfast food offerings and bakery and chilled foods, including health and wellness choices, and a new, everyday brewed coffee, Pike Placetm Roast, which returned the Company to the practice of grinding whole beans in stores and brewing every 30 minutes to provide customers with the freshest coffee possible. Fiscal 2009 The View Ahead Management expects the Company to continue to face a very difficult economic environment throughout fiscal 2009, both in the US and internationally, including in its two largest Company operated markets of Canada and the UK. As the global financial crisis has broadened and intensified, other sectors of the global economy have been adversely impacted and a severe global recession of uncertain length now appears likely. As a retailer that is dependent upon consumer discretionary spending, the Company expects to face an extremely challenging fiscal 2009 because of these economic conditions. Accordingly, Starbucks expects to report negative comparable store sales for fiscal 2009. Additionally, the Companys earnings for fiscal 2009 will be impacted by lease termination and severance costs from the US and Australia store closures, totaling up to an estimated $0.12 of EPS for fiscal 2009. The Company estimates that the combination of the US and Australia store closures and head count reductions will result in a pre tax benefit to operating income of approximately $200 million to $210 million in fiscal 2009, which equates to approximately $0.17 to $0.18 of EPS. Starbucks plans to be disciplined in its approach to new store openings, in both Company operated and licensed markets, and adjust as needed in response to further worsening in the global economy. Starbucks fiscal 2009 US store opening target is approximately a negative 20 net new stores, which includes a nearly 225 Company operated store decline and approximately 205 net new licensed stores. Internationally, Starbucks is planning to open approximately 700 net new stores in fiscal 2009, two thirds of which are expected to be licensed, as it factors in the current global economic climate, with a more cautious approach in the UK and western Europe. Operating Segment Overview Starbucks has three reportable operating segments: United States, International and CPG. The United States and International segments both include Company operated retail stores, licensed retail stores and foodservice operations. Licensed stores frequently have a higher operating margin than Company operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues, but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily borne by the licensee. The International segment has a higher relative share of licensed stores versus Company operated compared to the US segment; however, the US segment has been operating significantly longer than the International segment and has developed deeper awareness of, and attachment to, the Starbucks brand and stores among its customer base. As a result, the more mature US segment has significantly more stores, and higher total revenues than the International segment. Average sales per store are also higher in the US due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels. Further, certain market costs, particularly occupancy costs, are lower in the US segment compared to the average for the International segment, which comprises a more diverse group of operations. As a result of the relative strength of the brand in the US segment, the number of stores, the higher unit volumes, and the lower market costs, the US segment, despite its higher relative percentage of Company operated stores, has a higher operating margin, excluding restructuring costs, than the less developed International segment. 23 Table of Contents The Companys International store base continues to increase and Starbucks has been achieving a growing contribution from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets, such as China, Brazil and Russia. The Companys newer international markets require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income. The CPG segment includes packaged coffee and tea as well as branded products operations worldwide. The CPG segment operates primarily through joint ventures and licensing arrangements with large consumer products business partners, most significantly The North American Coffee Partnership with the Pepsi Cola Company for distribution of ready to drink beverages, and with Kraft Foods Inc. for distribution of packaged coffees and teas. This operating model allows the CPG segment to leverage the business partners existing infrastructures and to extend the Starbucks brand in an efficient way. Most of the customer revenues from the ready to drink and packaged coffee channels are recognized as revenues by the joint venture or licensed business partner, not by the CPG segment, and the proportionate share of the results of the Companys joint ventures are included on a net basis in Income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings. As a result, the CPG segment reflects relatively lower revenues, a modest cost structure, and a resulting higher operating margin, compared to the Companys other two reporting segments, which consist primarily of retail stores. Expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. These unallocated corporate expenses include certain general and administrative expenses, related depreciation and amortization expenses, restructuring charges and amounts included in Interest income and other, net and Interest expense on the consolidated statements of earnings.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2007 Consolidated results of operations (in millions): Sep 28, Sep 30, Sep 28, Sep 30, Fiscal Year Ended 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 % of Total Net Revenues STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS DATA Net revenues: Company operated retail $ 8,771.9 $ 7,998.3 9.7 % 84.5 % 85.0 % Specialty: Licensing 1,171.6 1,026.3 14.2 11.3 10.9 Foodservice and other 439.5 386.9 13.6 4.2 4.1 Total specialty 1,611.1 1,413.2 14.0 15.5 15.0 Total net revenues $ 10,383.0 $ 9,411.5 10.3 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Net revenues for the fiscal year ended 2008 increased due to growth in both Company operated retail revenues and specialty operations. During fiscal 2008, Starbucks derived 84% of total net revenues from its Company operated retail stores. Company operated retail revenues increased, primarily attributable to the opening of 681 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months, offset by negative 3% comparable store sales for the same period. Revenue growth was slower than in previous years due to a combination of declining comparable store sales and a decrease in the number of net new stores opened during fiscal 2008. The weakness in consolidated comparable store sales was driven by the US segment, which posted a comparable store sales decline of 5% for the year. Partially offsetting this was 2% comparable store sales growth in the International segment. Within fiscal 2008, consolidated quarterly revenue 24 Table of Contents growth decelerated each quarter and comparable store sales declined each quarter, reflecting the ongoing challenging economic conditions in the US. The Company derived the remaining 16% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company operated retail stores, collectively known as specialty operations. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements as well as grocery, warehouse club and certain other branded product operations, increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 988 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. The increase in Foodservice and other revenues was primarily driven by growth in new and existing accounts in the US foodservice business. For fiscal 2009, the Company expects total revenues to be relatively flat compared to fiscal 2008, with variations driven by the level of comparable store sales. Sep 28, Sep 30, Sep 28, Sep 30, Fiscal Year Ended 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 % of Total Net Revenues Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 4,645.3 $ 3,999.1 16.2 % 44.7 % 42.5 % Store operating expenses(1) 3,745.1 3,215.9 16.5 36.1 34.2 Other operating expenses(2) 330.1 294.2 12.2 3.2 3.1 Depreciation and amortization expenses 549.3 467.2 17.6 5.3 5.0 General and administrative expenses 456.0 489.2 (6.8 ) 4.4 5.2 Restructuring charges 266.9 nm 2.6 Total operating expenses 9,992.7 8,465.6 18.0 96.2 89.9 Income from equity investees 113.6 108.0 5.2 1.1 1.1 Operating income $ 503.9 $ 1,053.9 (52.2 )% 4.9 % 11.2 % (1) As a percentage of related Company operated retail revenues, store operating expenses were 42.7% and 40.2% for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. (2) As a percentage of related total specialty revenues, other operating expenses were 20.5% and 20.8% for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. As discussed in the Management Overview section above, many of the Companys operating expenses are fixed in nature. As a result, the softness in US revenues during fiscal 2008 impacted nearly all consolidated and US segment operating expense line items when viewed as a percentage of sales, and pressured operating margins. Cost of sales including occupancy costs increased primarily due to higher distribution costs and higher rent expenses as a percentage of revenues. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company operated retail revenues increased primarily due to higher payroll expenditures as a percentage of revenues coupled with impairment provisions in the US business, primarily driven by the slowdown in projected store openings. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to the opening of 681 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months. General and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll related expenses. Restructuring charges include asset impairment, lease exit and severance costs. These costs are associated with the closure of underperforming stores in the US and Australia, and the rationalization of the Companys leadership structure and non store organization. See Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. 25 Table of Contents Operating margin compression was primarily due to lower revenues; in addition, restructuring charges accounted for approximately 40% of the decrease. Sep 28, Sep 30, Sep 28, Sep 30, Fiscal Year Ended 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 % of Total Net Revenues Interest income and other, net $ 9.0 $ 40.4 (77.7 )% 0.1 % 0.4 % Interest expense (53.4 ) (38.0 ) 40.5 (0.5 ) (0.4 ) Earnings before income taxes 459.5 1,056.3 (56.5 ) 4.4 11.2 Income taxes 144.0 383.7 (62.5 ) 1.4 4.1 Net earnings $ 315.5 $ 672.6 (53.1 )% 3.0 % 7.1 % Interest income and other net, decreased due primarily to unrealized market value losses on the Companys trading securities portfolio. As described in more detail in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, the trading securities approximate a portion of the Companys liability under its Management Deferred Compensation Plan (MDCP). The MDCP liability also increases and decreases with changes in investment performance, with this offsetting impact recorded in General and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings. Interest expense increased due to the Companys issuance of $550 million of 10 year 6.25% Senior Notes in August of fiscal 2007. Income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2008 resulted in an effective tax rate of 31.3% compared to 36.3% for fiscal 2007. The lower rate is due to the higher proportion of income earned in foreign jurisdictions which have lower tax rates, as well as an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction for manufacturing activities in the US. Operating Segments Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the Companys management reviews financial information for operational decision making purposes. Starbucks has three reportable operating segments: United States, International and CPG. Unallocated Corporate includes expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. Operating income represents earnings before Interest income and other, net, Interest expense and Income taxes. The following tables summarize the Companys results of operations by segment for fiscal 2008 and 2007 (in millions). United States The United States operating segment sells coffee and other beverages, complementary food, whole bean coffees, and coffee brewing equipment and merchandise primarily through Company operated retail stores. Specialty operations within the United States include licensed retail stores, foodservice accounts and other initiatives related to the Companys core business. Sep 28, Sep 30, Sep 28, Sep 30, Fiscal Year Ended 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 As a % of US Total Net Revenues Net revenues: Company operated retail $ 6,997.7 $ 6,560.9 6.7 % 88.7 % 89.3 % Specialty: Licensing 504.2 439.1 14.8 6.4 6.0 Foodservice and other 385.1 349.0 10.3 4.9 4.7 Total specialty 889.3 788.1 12.8 11.3 10.7 Total net revenues $ 7,887.0 $ 7,349.0 7.3 % 100.0 % 100.0 % 26 Table of Contents Company operated retail revenues increased primarily due to the opening of 445 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months, partially offset by a 5% decrease in comparable store sales for fiscal 2008. The US Company operated retail business continued to experience deteriorating trends in transactions during the year, driven by the US economic slowdown. Licensing revenues increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 438 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts. Sep 28, Sep 30, Sep 28, Sep 30, Fiscal Year Ended 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 As a % of US Total Net Revenues Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 3,371.7 $ 2,956.2 14.1 % 42.8 % 40.2 % Store operating expenses(1) 3,081.0 2,684.2 14.8 39.1 36.5 Other operating expenses(2) 219.6 204.8 7.2 2.8 2.8 Depreciation and amortization expenses 401.7 348.2 15.4 5.1 4.7 General and administrative expenses 72.7 85.9 (15.4 ) 0.9 1.2 Restructuring charges 210.9 nm 2.7 Total operating expenses 7,357.6 6,279.3 17.2 93.3 85.4 Income from equity investees (1.3 ) 0.8 nm Operating income $ 528.1 $ 1,070.5 (50.7 )% 6.7 % 14.6 % (1) As a percentage of related Company operated retail revenues, store operating expenses were 44.0% and 40.9% for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. (2) As a percentage of related total specialty revenues, other operating expenses were 24.7% and 26.0% for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. Operating margin contracted significantly primarily due to restructuring charges incurred and to softer revenues due to weak traffic, as well as higher cost of sales including occupancy costs and higher store operating expenses as a percentage of revenues. Restructuring charges of $210.9 million had a 270 basis point impact on the operating margin. The increase in cost of sales including occupancy costs was primarily due to higher distribution costs and higher rent expenses as a percentage of revenues. Higher store operating expenses was due to the softer sales, higher payroll related expenditures, and charges from canceling future store sites and asset impairments. International The International operating segment sells coffee and other beverages, complementary food, whole bean coffees, and coffee brewing equipment and merchandise through Company operated retail stores in Canada, the UK and nine other markets. Specialty operations primarily include retail store licensing operations in nearly forty other countries and foodservice accounts, primarily in Canada and Japan. The Companys International store base continues to increase and Starbucks expects to achieve a growing contribution from established areas of the business while at the same time investing in emerging markets and channels. Many of the Companys International operations are in early stages of development that require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income, than in the United States. This continuing investment is part of the Companys long term, balanced plan for profitable growth. 27 Table of Contents Sep 28, Sep 30, Sep 28, Sep 30, Fiscal Year Ended 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 As a % of International Total Net Revenues Net revenues: Company operated retail $ 1,774.2 $ 1,437.4 23.4 % 84.3 % 84.7 % Specialty: Licensing 274.8 220.9 24.4 13.1 13.0 Foodservice and other 54.4 37.9 43.5 2.6 2.2 Total specialty 329.2 258.8 27.2 15.7 15.3 Total net revenues $ 2,103.4 $ 1,696.2 24.0 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Company operated retail revenues increased due to the opening of 236 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months, favorable foreign currency exchange rates, primarily on the Canadian dollar, and comparable store sales growth of 2% for fiscal 2008. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, Company operated retail revenues grew at a slower rate year over year of 12% and comparable store sales were flat compared to the same quarter in fiscal 2007, both driven by slowdowns in the UK and Canada, due to the weakening global economy. Specialty revenues increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from opening 550 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Sep 28, Sep 30, Sep 28, Sep 30, Fiscal Year Ended 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 As a % of International Total Net Revenues Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 1,054.0 $ 824.6 27.8 % 50.1 % 48.6 % Store operating expenses(1) 664.1 531.7 24.9 31.6 31.3 Other operating expenses(2) 88.5 69.9 26.6 4.2 4.1 Depreciation and amortization expenses 108.8 84.2 29.2 5.2 5.0 General and administrative expenses 113.0 93.8 20.5 5.4 5.5 Restructuring charges 19.2 nm 0.9 Total operating expenses 2,047.6 1,604.2 27.6 97.3 94.6 Income from equity investees 54.2 45.7 18.6 2.6 2.7 Operating income $ 110.0 $ 137.7 (20.1 )% 5.2 % 8.1 % (1) As a percentage of related Company operated retail revenues, store operating expenses were 37.4% and 37.0% for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. (2) As a percentage of related total specialty revenues, other operating expenses were 26.9% and 27.0% for the fiscal years ended September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. Operating margin decreased primarily due to higher cost of sales including occupancy costs driven by continued expansion of lunch and warming programs in Canada, higher distribution costs, and higher building maintenance expense due to store renovation activities. In addition, restructuring charges of $19.2 million recognized in fiscal 2008 had a 90 basis point impact on the operating margin, nearly all due to the closure of 61 Company operated stores in Australia. Global Consumer Products Group The CPG operating segment sells a selection of whole bean and ground coffees and premium Tazo teas through licensing arrangements in United States and international markets. CPG also produces and sells a variety of ready to drink beverages through its joint ventures and marketing and distribution agreements. 28 Table of Contents Sep 28, Sep 30, Sep 28, Sep 30, Fiscal Year Ended 2008 2007 % Change 2008 2007 As a % of CPG Total Net Revenues Net revenues: Licensing $ 392.6 $ 366.3 7.2 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Total specialty 392.6 366.3 7.2 100.0 100.0 Total net revenues increased primarily due to higher royalties and product sales in the international ready to drink business and increased sales of US packaged tea and International club packaged coffee.

During the fiscal year ended 2007, Starbucks derived 85% of total net revenues from its Company operated retail stores. Company operated retail revenues increased primarily due to the opening of 1,342 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months and comparable store sales growth of 5% for the fiscal year ended 2007. The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in the average value per transaction and a 1% increase in the number of customer transactions. The Company derived the remaining 15% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company operated retail stores, collectively known as specialty operations. Licensing revenues, which are derived from retail store licensing arrangements as well as grocery, warehouse club and certain other branded product operations, increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 1,229 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months and a 20% increase in licensing revenues from the Companys CPG business. Foodservice and other revenues increased due to growth in new and existing accounts in the US foodservice business. Sep 30, Oct 1, Sep 30, Oct 1, Fiscal Year Ended 2007 2006 % Change 2007 2006 % of Total Net Revenues Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 3,999.1 $ 3,178.8 25.8 % 42.5 % 40.8 % Store operating expenses(1) 3,215.9 2,687.8 19.6 34.2 34.5 Other operating expenses(2) 294.2 253.7 16.0 3.1 3.3 Depreciation and amortization expenses 467.2 387.2 20.7 5.0 5.0 General and administrative expenses 489.2 479.4 2.0 5.2 6.2 Total operating expenses 8,465.6 6,986.9 21.2 89.9 89.7 Income from equity investees 108.0 94.0 14.9 1.1 1.2 Operating income $ 1,053.9 $ 894.0 17.9 % 11.2 % 11.5 % (1) As a percentage of related Company operated retail revenues, store operating expenses were 40.2% and 40.8% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006, respectively. (2) As a percentage of related total specialty revenues, other operating expenses were 20.8% and 21.1% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006, respectively. 30 Table of Contents Cost of sales including occupancy costs increased primarily due to a shift in sales mix to higher cost products, the rise in distribution costs, higher rent expense and higher dairy costs. Dairy expense for the US segment represents approximately 75% of the total Companys dairy expense. For the US segment the average dairy costs per gallon rose 10% in fiscal 2007 compared to fiscal 2006, resulting in approximately $20 million of additional expense. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company operated retail revenues decreased primarily due to higher provisions for incentive compensation in the prior year due to exceptionally strong performance as well as leverage on regional overhead costs in fiscal 2007. Other operating expenses decreased primarily as a result of controlled discretionary spending in fiscal 2007. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to the opening of 1,342 new Company operated retail stores in the last 12 months. General and administrative expenses increased primarily due to higher payroll related expenditures in support of continued global growth, offset in part by unusually high charitable contributions in fiscal 2006. Income from equity investees increased primarily due to higher equity income from international investees. Operating margin compression was due to higher costs of sales and occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues due to a shift in sales to higher cost products and higher distribution costs, rent expense and dairy costs. These cost pressures were offset in part by leveraging general and administrative expenses, store operating expenses, and other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues.

The US Company operated retail business experienced deteriorating trends in transactions late in the year, driven by, management believes, the US economic slowdown combined with two price increases in US retail stores implemented in fiscal 2007. Licensing revenues increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 723 new licensed retail stores in the last 12 months. Foodservice and other revenues increased primarily due to growth in new and existing foodservice accounts.

(2) As a percentage of related total specialty revenues, other operating expenses were 26.0% and 27.9% for the fiscal years ended September 30, 2007 and October 1, 2006, respectively. Operating margin decreased due to higher cost of sales including occupancy costs, primarily due to a shift in sales mix to higher cost products such as food and merchandise, higher distribution costs, higher rent expense and higher dairy costs. Partially offsetting these were lower store operating expenses, lower general and administrative expenses, and lower other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues. The decline in store operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to higher provisions for incentive compensation in the prior year as well as leverage on regional overhead costs in fiscal 2007. General and administrative expenses were lower primarily due to decreased salary and related benefits expense as well as lower professional fees. The 32 Table of Contents decline in other operating expenses as a percentage of total net revenues was primarily due to controlled discretionary spending in the current year.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companys existing cash and liquid investments were $322.3 million and $459.7 million as of September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. The decrease in liquid investments was driven primarily by $59.8 million of auction rate securities, nearly all of which are held within the Companys wholly owned captive insurance company, that are not currently considered liquid and were reclassified to long term investments in the second quarter of fiscal 2008. 34 Table of Contents Included in the cash and liquid investment balances are the following: A portfolio of unrestricted trading securities, designed to hedge the Companys liability under its Management Deferred Compensation Plan (MDCP). The value of this portfolio was $49.5 million and $73.6 million as of September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. The decrease was driven by the sale of a bond income fund to better align with the Companys total risk profile and declines in market values of the underlying equity funds, which were offset by a comparable decline in the MDCP liability. Unrestricted cash and liquid securities, held within the Companys wholly owned captive insurance company, to fund claim payouts. The value of these unrestricted cash and liquid securities was approximately $35.6 million and $98.1 million as of September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, respectively. The decrease was due primarily to reclassification of auction rate securities held by the wholly owned captive. As described in more detail in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, as of September 28, 2008, the Company had $74.4 million invested in available for sale securities, consisting primarily of auction rate securities. While the ongoing auction failures will limit the liquidity of these investments for some period of time, the Company does not believe the auction failures will materially impact its ability to fund its working capital needs, capital expenditures or other business requirements. The Company manages the balance of its cash and liquid investments in order to internally fund operating needs and make scheduled interest and principal payments on its borrowings. Following the Companys announcement on July 1, 2008 that it planned to close approximately 600 underperforming US Company operated stores and reduce new store growth in fiscal year 2009, Standard Poors placed the BBB+ long term rating and A 2 short term ratings for Starbucks on CreditWatch with negative implications. On July 3, 2008, Moodys placed the Baa1 senior unsecured rating for Starbucks on review for possible downgrade, however Moodys reaffirmed the Companys Prime 2 short term rating for commercial paper. Standard and Poors and Moodys subsequently downgraded the long term ratings as of September 4, 2008 and November 17, 2008, respectively. Credit rating agencies currently rate the Companys borrowings as follows: Description Standard Poors Moodys Short term debt A 2 P 2 Senior unsecured long term debt BBB Baa2 Outlook Stable Negative Standard Poors downgraded the Companys long term rating from BBB+ to BBB on September 4, 2008, and re affirmed the A 2 short term rating. At the same time, Standard Poors outlook was changed to stable. Moodys downgraded the Companys long term rating from Baa1 to Baa2 on November 17, 2008, and re affirmed the Companys Prime 2 short term rating for commercial paper. At the same time, Moodys outlook was changed to negative. Factors that may affect credit ratings include changes in the Companys operating performance, the economic environment and the Companys capital structure. In order to maintain its credit ratings, there is an expectation that the Company will modestly reduce its leverage during fiscal 2009. The Company expects to improve its leverage ratio below a certain target level primarily through the reduction in short term borrowings. Credit rating downgrades can adversely impact, among other things, future borrowing costs, access to capital markets, and future operating lease terms. If either of the Companys short term ratings were downgraded, it would likely make the issuance of commercial paper difficult. In these circumstances the Company could draw upon its credit facility. In normal market conditions, it is generally more favorable for the Company to issue commercial paper rather than borrow against the credit facility. However, as described in Item 1A Risk Factors the ongoing global financial crisis may result in conditions where commercial paper is not available at reasonable rates. In such situations the Company is more likely to draw on its credit facility. During the fourth quarter of fiscal 2008, the Company borrowed against the credit facility as liquidity conditions in the commercial paper market deteriorated. As of September 28, 2008, borrowings outstanding under the credit facility totaled $300 million. 35 Table of Contents The Companys credit facility contains provisions requiring Starbucks to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. As of September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, the Company was in compliance with each of these covenants. On October 31, 2008, the Company entered into an amendment to the credit facility to exclude up to $130 million of lease termination expenses and lease exit costs incurred during the period beginning on June 30, 2008 and ending September 27, 2009 from the agreements Operating Lease and Rental Expense definition. The purpose of the amendment was to limit the short term effects of lease related restructuring expenses from the Companys store closure actions on the fixed charge coverage ratio. These expenses would have otherwise put pressure on the coverage ratio and raised the risk of the Company losing access to liquidity. Over the long term, the reduction in lease expense and improvement in operating cash flows resulting from these store closures are expected to have a favorable effect on this coverage ratio. The amendment also increased the cost to borrow under the facility by an additional 0.10% to 0.40%, depending on the Companys fixed charge ratio and its senior unsecured debt rating. The $550 million of 10 year 6.25% Senior Notes, issued in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2007, also require Starbucks to maintain compliance with certain covenants that limit future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007, the Company was in compliance with each of these covenants. The Company expects to use its cash and liquid investments, including any borrowings under its revolving credit facility and commercial paper program to invest in its core businesses, including new beverage innovations, as well as other new business opportunities related to its core businesses. The Company may use its available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to its equity method and cost method investees. Any decisions to increase its ownership interest in its equity method investees or licensed operations will be driven by valuation and fit with the Companys ownership strategy and are likely to be infrequent. Depending on market conditions and within the constraint of maintaining an appropriate capital structure, Starbucks may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. Due to the current challenging operating and economic environment, the Company continues to be conservative in its uses of cash and did not repurchase any shares in the second, third or fourth quarters of fiscal 2008. Management also does not currently anticipate any share repurchases in fiscal 2009. Management believes that cash flows generated from operations and existing cash and liquid investments should be sufficient to finance capital requirements for its core businesses for the foreseeable future, as well as to fund the cost of lease termination and severance costs from the US and Australia store closures. As a result, the Company expects to decrease short term borrowings in fiscal 2009. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2009 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for new Company operated retail stores, remodeling and refurbishment of existing Company operated retail stores, and new equipment to support enhanced quality standards and expanded offerings in the stores. Other capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 are expected to consist principally of investments in information technology systems and in the Companys global supply chain operations. Total expenditures for fiscal 2009 are expected to be approximately $700 million. Cash provided by operating activities decreased by $72.5 million to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2008 compared to the corresponding period of fiscal 2007. The modest decrease was primarily due to the slowing pace of store construction which led to a decline in the balance in accounts payable year over year. Cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2008 totaled $1.1 billion. Net capital additions to property, plant and equipment used $984.5 million, primarily from opening new Company operated retail stores and remodeling certain existing stores during fiscal 2008. In addition, the sale and maturity of available for sale securities provided $75.9 million and $20.0 million, respectively, for fiscal 2008, consisting primarily of auction rate securities and agency notes. The auction rate securities were sold through the normal auction process prior to the auction failures that began in mid February 2008, as described in Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, and the agency notes, issued by government sponsored enterprises, were called in the first half of fiscal 2008. Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2008 totaled $184.5 million. Cash used to repurchase shares of the Companys common stock totaled $311.4 million, all in the first quarter of fiscal 2008. This amount includes the 36 Table of Contents effect of the net change in unsettled trades from September 30, 2007 of $16.1 million. Net repayments of commercial paper were $297.2 million and net borrowings under short term borrowings were $299.4 million for fiscal 2008. As of September 28, 2008, a total of $713.2 million in borrowings were outstanding under the combined commercial paper program and revolving credit facility, as well as $15.9 million in letters of credit which were outstanding under the credit facility, leaving $270.9 million of capacity available under the $1 billion combined commercial paper program and revolving credit facility. Partially offsetting cash used for share repurchases were proceeds of $112.3 million from the exercise of employee stock options and the sale of the Companys common stock from employee stock purchase plans. As options granted are exercised, Starbucks will continue to receive proceeds and a tax deduction, but the amount and the timing of these cash flows cannot be reliably predicted as option holders decisions to exercise options will be largely driven by movements in the Companys stock price. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and borrowings as of September 28, 2008, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on the Companys liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less than 1 1 3 3 5 More than Contractual Obligations(1) Total Year Years Years 5 Years Debt obligations(2) $ 1,573.9 $ 748.4 $ 69.2 $ 68.8 $ 687.5 Operating lease obligations(3) 5,098.1 741.0 1,367.2 1,151.1 1,838.8 Purchase obligations(4) 682.3 575.5 93.2 11.1 2.5 Other obligations(5) 102.3 4.1 11.2 8.6 78.4 Total $ 7,456.6 $ 2,069.0 $ 1,540.8 $ 1,239.6 $ 2,607.2 (1) Liabilities for incomes taxes under FIN 48 were excluded as the Company is not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments. As of September 28, 2008, the Company had $52.6 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits under FIN 48. (2) Debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments on commercial paper, credit facility borrowings, and long term debt. (3) Amounts include the direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses. (4) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Purchase obligations relate primarily to green coffee. (5) Other obligations include other long term liabilities primarily consisting of asset retirement obligations, capital lease obligations and hedging instruments. Starbucks expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business, as well as ongoing borrowings under the combined commercial paper program and revolving credit facility. Off Balance Sheet Arrangement The Companys off balance sheet arrangements relate to certain guarantees and are detailed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this 10 K. COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS Commodity price risk represents the Companys primary market risk, generated by its purchases of green coffee and dairy products. The Company purchases, roasts and sells high quality whole bean arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, the Company also purchases significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of its Company operated retail stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts the Companys results of operations and can be expected to impact its future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10 K. 37 Table of Contents FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity prices, and interest rates. The Company manages its exposure to various market based risks according to an umbrella risk management policy. Under this policy, market based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The umbrella risk management policy governs the hedging instruments the business may use and limits the dollar risk to net earnings. The Company also monitors and limits the amount of associated counterparty credit risk. Additionally, this policy restricts, among other things, the amount of market based risk the Company will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading activity. In general, hedge instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years. The sensitivity analyses performed below provide only a limited, point in time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses. Commodity Price Risk The Company purchases commodity inputs, including coffee and dairy products that are used in its operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact its financial results. In addition to fixed priced contracts and price to be fixed contracts for coffee purchases, the Company may enter into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying commodity prices of its commodity hedges, as of the end of fiscal 2008, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The majority of the Companys revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in US dollars. However, because a portion of the Companys operations consists of activities outside of the United States, the Company has transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, British pound sterling, euro, and Japanese yen. As a result, Starbucks may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues, inventory purchases, assets, and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As of September 28, 2008, the Company had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases. In addition, Starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of its net investment in Starbucks Japan, as well as the Companys net investments in its Canada, UK, and China subsidiaries, to minimize foreign currency exposure. The Company also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes (free standing derivatives), but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables. Increases or decreases in the fair value of these hedges are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the US dollar value of the Companys foreign currency denominated payables and receivables (i.e. hedged items) that would occur within the hedging period. The following table summarizes the potential impact to the Companys future net earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI) from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the US dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions): September 28, 2008 Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase in 10% Decrease in 10% Increase in 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Foreign currency hedges $ 68 (56 ) 15 (19 ) 38 Table of Contents Equity Security Price Risk The Company has minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds within its trading portfolio. The trading securities approximate a portion of the Companys liability under the MDCP. A corresponding liability is included in Accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets. These investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in Interest income and other, net in the consolidated statements of earnings. The offsetting changes in the MDCP liability are recorded in General and administrative expenses. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of its investments, as of the end of fiscal 2008, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. Interest Rate Risk The Company utilizes short term and long term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on its existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt. At the end of fiscal years 2008 and 2007, the Company did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding. The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates on the fair value of the Companys debt (in millions): September 28, 2008 Change in Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase in 100 Basis Point Decrease in Fair Value Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Debt $ 1,251 (35 ) 35 The Companys available for sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments. The primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity. Available for sale securities are investment grade and are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of Accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company does not hedge the interest rate exposure on its available for sale securities. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of its available for sale securities as of the end of fiscal 2008, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results, and require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. Starbucks considers its policies on asset impairment, stock based compensation, operating leases, self insurance reserves and income taxes to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements. Asset Impairment When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets to projected future cash flows, in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses. For goodwill and other intangible assets, impairment tests are performed annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill carrying values exceed estimated reporting unit fair values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the Companys trademarks. Upon indication that the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable, the Company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations. Judgments made by the Company related to 39 Table of Contents the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability of the Company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. As the Company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its long lived assets, these factors could cause the Company to realize material impairment charges. Stock based Compensation Starbucks accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of SFAS No. 123(R), Share Based Payment. The Company uses the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them (expected term), the estimated volatility of the Companys common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements (forfeitures). Changes in the subjective assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation; however based on an analysis using changes in certain assumptions that could be reasonably possible in the near term, management believes the effect on the expense recognized for fiscal 2008 would not have been material. Operating Leases Starbucks leases retail stores, roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases. The Company provides for an estimate of asset retirement obligation (ARO) expense at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term. Estimating AROs involves subjective assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs. Future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated. In addition, the large number of operating leases and the significant number of international markets in which the Company has operating leases adds administrative complexity to the calculation of ARO expense, as well as to the other technical accounting requirements of operating leases such as contingent rent. Starbucks accounts for lease contract termination costs in accordance with SFAS 146, Accounting for Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities. Estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions, including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income. The estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate. Self Insurance Reserves The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for the potential liabilities for workers compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance, director and officers liability insurance and vehicle liability. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes Starbucks accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No. 109, Accounting for Income Taxes, which recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities. Accruals for uncertain tax positions are accounted for under FASB Interpretation No. 48, Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes, an interpretation of FASB Statement No. 109 (FIN 48). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. These include establishing a valuation allowance related to the realizability of certain deferred tax assets. Accounting for uncertain tax positions requires significant judgments, including estimating the amount, timing and likelihood of ultimate settlement. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates. 40 Table of Contents RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements in this 10 K.
