Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Starbucks Corporations fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. The fiscal years ended on September 27, 2009, September 28, 2008 and September 30, 2007 all included 52 weeks. Starbucks 2010 fiscal year will include 53 weeks, with the 53rd week falling in its fourth fiscal quarter. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. Overview Fiscal 2009 was a challenging year for Starbucks. The Company was confronted with extraordinary economic and operating challenges in addition to facing an increasingly competitive landscape. Although the global economy has shown some signs of improvement recently, management recognizes the difficult economic situation that many consumers are still facing and does not expect that to significantly change over the course of fiscal 2010. This challenging economic environment has strained consumer discretionary spending in the US and internationally, which in turn has impacted Company revenues, comparable store sales, operating income and operating margins. Starbucks responded to this difficult environment with a more disciplined focus on operations and the introduction of initiatives to permanently improve the Companys cost structure. The result is an underlying business model that is less reliant on high revenue growth to drive profitability, and that still preserves the fundamental strengths and values of the Starbucks brand. The primary initiatives in this strategy include rationalizing the global Company operated store portfolio, right sizing the non retail support organization, and reducing the Companys cost structure, while renewing the focus on service excellence in the stores and delivering relevant innovation. Starbucks actions to rationalize its global store portfolio have included the planned closure of nearly 1,000 Company operated stores globally. At the end of fiscal 2009, nearly all of the approximately 800 US Company operated stores, 61 stores in Australia and 41 Company operated stores in other International markets had been closed. The remaining International store closures are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal 2010. Initiatives targeting reductions in the Companys cost structure in fiscal 2009 proceeded as planned, with full year costs of $580 million removed from the Companys cost structure. These targeted cost reductions and associated operational efficiency efforts, along with a more profitable Company operated store base, have moved Starbucks toward a more sustainable business model, while preserving the fundamental strengths and values of the brand. The operational efficiency efforts are primarily focused on store level execution and include improved staffing models and better management of waste in coffee, dairy and food. Starbucks actions to improve the customer experience have resulted in a more focused effort toward in store offerings, and simplifying the demands on store partners (employees), while concurrently raising already high standards for beverage and food offerings, customer service and the overall in store experience. The effects of these efforts have already been seen in the Companys improved customer satisfaction scores. Starbucks has a renewed focus on relevant product innovation and the disciplined expansion and leveraging of its existing products and sales channels. For example, Starbucks VIAtm Ready Brew coffee was launched in fiscal 2009 and is designed to capture a significant share of both the $21 billion global instant coffee category and the single serve market. The Company intends to drive sales within the retail store base and CPG channels, both in the US and internationally. The Company continues to maintain a solid financial foundation, with no short term debt outstanding at the end of fiscal 2009 and with cash and liquid investments totaling more than $650 million. This solid financial position and continued strong cash flow generation have provided Starbucks with the financial flexibility to implement its restructuring efforts as well as make ongoing investments in its core business. Fiscal 2010 The View Ahead For fiscal 2010, the Company expects revenues to grow in the low to mid single digits compared to fiscal 2009, driven by modestly positive comparable store sales, a 53rd fiscal week, and approximately 100 planned net new 21 Table of Contents stores in the US and approximately 200 net new stores in International markets. Both the US and International net new additions are expected to be primarily licensed stores. Given these revenue expectations, combined with the Companys reduced cost structure, in store operating efficiencies, and lower restructuring charges, Starbucks currently expects significant improvement in its consolidated operating margin in fiscal 2010. Operating cash flow for fiscal 2010 is currently expected to reach approximately $1.4 billion and capital expenditures are expected to range from $500 million to $550 million. Operating Segment Overview Starbucks has three reportable operating segments: US, International and CPG. The US foodservice business, which was previously reported in the US segment, is now reported in the CPG segment, as a result of internal management realignments within the US and CPG businesses. Segment information for all prior periods presented has been revised to reflect this change. The US and International segments both include Company operated retail stores and licensed retail stores. Licensed stores frequently have a higher operating margin than Company operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues, but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily borne by the licensee. The International segment has a higher relative share of licensed stores versus Company operated compared to the US segment; however, the US segment has been operating significantly longer than the International segment and has developed deeper awareness of, and attachment to, the Starbucks brand and stores among its customer base. As a result, the more mature US segment has significantly more stores, and higher total revenues than the International segment. Average sales per store are also higher in the US due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels. Further, certain market costs, particularly occupancy costs, are lower in the US segment compared to the average for the International segment, which comprises a more diverse group of operations. As a result of the relative strength of the brand in the US segment, the number of stores, the higher unit volumes, and the lower market costs, the US segment, despite its higher relative percentage of Company operated stores, has a higher operating margin, excluding restructuring costs, than the less developed International segment. The Companys International store base continues to expand and Starbucks has been focusing on achieving sustainable growth from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets, such as China, Brazil and Russia. The Companys newer international markets require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income. The CPG segment includes packaged coffee and tea, and other branded products operations worldwide, and the US foodservice business. For the packaged coffee and tea and branded products, Starbucks operates primarily through licensing arrangements and joint ventures with large consumer products business partners, most significantly with Kraft for distribution of packaged coffees and teas, and The North American Coffee Partnership with the Pepsi Cola Company for manufacturing and distribution of ready to drink beverages. This operating model allows the CPG segment to leverage the business partners existing infrastructures and to extend the Starbucks brand in an efficient way. Most of the customer revenues from the packaged coffee and ready to drink products are recognized as revenues by the licensed or joint venture business partner, not by the CPG segment. Royalties and payments from our licensing agreements are recorded under licensing revenue, and the proportionate share of the results of the Companys joint ventures are included, on a net basis, in Income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings. The US foodservice business sells coffee and other related products to institutional foodservice companies with the majority of its sales through national broadline distribution networks. The CPG segment reflects relatively lower revenues, a modest cost structure, and a resulting higher operating margin, compared to the Companys other two reporting segments, which consist primarily of retail stores. Expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. These unallocated corporate expenses include certain general and administrative expenses, related depreciation and amortization expenses, corporate restructuring charges and amounts included in Net interest income and other and Interest expense on the consolidated statements of earnings. 22 Table of Contents Acquisitions See Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements in this 10 K. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008 Financial Highlights Consolidated operating income was $562 million for fiscal 2009 compared to $504 million in fiscal 2008, and operating margin improved to 5.7% compared to 4.9% in fiscal 2008. Cost reduction initiatives and related operational efficiency efforts contributed significantly to the margin improvement, offset in part by higher restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 as Starbucks continued its work to rationalize its global store portfolio and support organization. EPS for fiscal 2009 was $0.52, compared to EPS of $0.43 reported in fiscal 2008. Restructuring charges impacted EPS by approximately $0.28 per share in fiscal 2009 and restructuring and other transformation costs impacted EPS by approximately $0.28 in fiscal 2008. Cash flow from operations was $1.4 billion in fiscal 2009 compared to $1.3 billion in fiscal 2008, while capital expenditures declined to $446 million in fiscal 2009 from $985 million in fiscal 2008. Available operating cash flow during fiscal 2009 was primarily used to reduce short term borrowings to a zero balance in fiscal 2009, down from $713 million at the beginning of the fiscal year. The Company realized approximately $580 million in reductions to its cost structure in fiscal 2009, with the initiatives focused on store closures, headcount reductions, in store efficiencies and supply chain improvements. Consolidated results of operations (in millions): Sep 27, Sep 28, Sep 27, Sep 28, Fiscal Year Ended 2009 2008 % Change 2009 2008 % of Total Net Revenues Net revenues: Company operated retail $ 8,180.1 $ 8,771.9 (6.7 )% 83.7 % 84.5 % Specialty: Licensing 1,222.3 1,171.6 4.3 12.5 11.3 Foodservice and other 372.2 439.5 (15.3 ) 3.8 4.2 Total specialty 1,594.5 1,611.1 (1.0 ) 16.3 15.5 Total net revenues $ 9,774.6 $ 10,383.0 (5.9 )% 100.0 % 100.0 % Company operated retail revenues decreased from fiscal 2008, primarily attributable to a 6% decline in comparable store sales, comprised of a 4% decline in transactions and a 2% decline in the average value per transaction. Foreign currency translation also contributed to the decline with the effects of a stronger US dollar relative to the British pound and Canadian dollar. The weakness in consolidated comparable store sales was driven by the US segment, with a comparable store sales decline of 6% for the year. The International segment experienced a 2% decline in comparable store sales. The Company derived 16% of total net revenues from channels outside the Company operated retail stores, collectively known as specialty operations. The decrease in Foodservice and other revenue was primarily due to the softness in the hospitality industry. 23 Table of Contents Sep 27, Sep 28, % Sep 27, Sep 28, Fiscal Year Ended 2009 2008 Change 2009 2008 % of Total Net Revenues Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 4,324.9 $ 4,645.3 (6.9 )% 44.2 % 44.7 % Store operating expenses 3,425.1 3,745.1 (8.5 ) 35.0 36.1 Other operating expenses 264.4 330.1 (19.9 ) 2.7 3.2 Depreciation and amortization expenses 534.7 549.3 (2.7 ) 5.5 5.3 General and administrative expenses 453.0 456.0 (0.7 ) 4.6 4.4 Restructuring charges 332.4 266.9 24.5 3.4 2.6 Total operating expenses 9,334.5 9,992.7 (6.6 ) 95.5 96.2 Income from equity investees 121.9 113.6 7.3 1.2 1.1 Operating income $ 562.0 $ 503.9 11.5 % 5.7 % 4.9 % Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 41.9 % 42.7 % Other operating expenses 16.6 % 20.5 % Cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to the implementation of in store operational efficiencies designed to reduce product waste, and due to lower dairy costs in the US, partially offset by higher coffee costs. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company operated retail revenues decreased primarily due to reduced headcount and spending in the regional support organization as a result of Starbucks restructuring efforts, and the effect of initiatives to improve store labor efficiencies. Restructuring charges include lease exit and related costs associated with the actions to rationalize the Companys global store portfolio and reduce the global cost structure. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Operating margin expansion was primarily due to the improved labor efficiency and reduced product waste in Company operated stores, partially offset by increased restructuring charges. Sep 27, Sep 28, % Sep 27, Sep 28, Fiscal Year Ended 2009 2008 Change 2009 2008 % of Total Net Revenues Operating income $ 562.0 $ 503.9 11.5 % 5.7 % 4.9 % Interest income and other, net 36.3 9.0 nm 0.4 0.1 Interest expense (39.1 ) (53.4 ) (26.8 ) (0.4 ) (0.5 ) Earnings before income taxes 559.2 459.5 21.7 5.7 4.4 Income taxes 168.4 144.0 16.9 1.7 1.4 Net earnings $ 390.8 $ 315.5 23.9 % 4.0 % 3.0 % Effective tax rate 30.1 % 31.3 % Net interest income and other increased due primarily to the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on certain balance sheet amounts. Also contributing to the increase were lower unrealized market value losses on the Companys trading securities portfolio compared to fiscal 2008. As described in more detail in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the trading securities approximate a portion of the Companys liability under its Management Deferred Compensation Plan (MDCP). The MDCP liability also increases and decreases with changes in investment performance, with this offsetting impact recorded in General and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings. Interest expense decreased due to a lower average balance of short term 24 Table of Contents borrowings and lower average short term borrowing rates in fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. At the end of fiscal 2009, the Company had no short term debt. The relatively low 2009 effective tax rate was primarily due to a tax benefit recognized for retroactive tax credits and an income tax credit related to the settlement of an employment tax audit in fiscal 2009. As a result of the audit settlement, approximately $17 million of expense was recorded in Store operating expenses, with an offsetting income tax credit and no impact to net earnings. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2010 is expected to be in the range of 34% to 35%. Operating Segments Segment information is prepared on the same basis that the Companys management reviews financial information for operational decision making purposes. Starbucks has three reportable operating segments: US, International and CPG. Unallocated Corporate includes expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support the operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. Operating income represents earnings before Net interest income and other, Interest expense and Income taxes. The US foodservice business, which was previously reported in the US segment, is now reported in the CPG segment, as a result of internal management realignments within the US and CPG businesses. Segment information for all prior periods presented has been revised to reflect this change. The following tables summarize the Companys results of operations by segment for fiscal 2009 and 2008 (in millions). United States The US operating segment sells coffee and other beverages, complementary food, whole bean coffees, and coffee brewing equipment and merchandise primarily through Company operated retail stores. Specialty operations within the US include licensed retail stores and other initiatives related to the Companys core business.

This improvement was primarily due to operational changes designed to improve labor efficiency and reduce product waste in Company operated stores, and to lower non store support costs. Partially offsetting the favorability were higher restructuring charges during the year. The Company incurred higher lease exit and related costs due to the higher number of actual store closures compared to the prior year period. International The International operating segment sells coffee and other beverages, complementary food, whole bean coffees, and coffee brewing equipment and merchandise through Company operated retail stores in Canada, the UK and several other markets. Specialty operations primarily include retail store licensing operations in nearly 40 other countries and foodservice accounts, primarily in Canada and the UK. The Companys International store base continues to expand and Starbucks expects to achieve a growing contribution from established areas of the business while at the same time investing in emerging markets and channels. Many of the Companys International operations are in early stages of development that require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income, than in the US. This continuing investment is part of the Companys long term, balanced plan for profitable growth.

Restructuring charges of $27.0 million recognized during the year had a 50 basis point impact on operating margin compared to the prior year, due to the previously announced store closures. Higher store operating expenses as of percentage of Company operated retail revenues were driven by an increase in store impairment charges and a decline in sales leverage impacting salaries and benefits. Partially offsetting the decrease in operating margin were lower other operating expenses due to headcount reductions in the non store support functions. Global Consumer Products Group CPGs licensing revenue is from selling a selection of whole bean and ground coffees and premium Tazo teas through licensing arrangements in US and international markets, and also producing and selling a variety of ready to drink beverages through its joint ventures and marketing and distribution agreements. The foodservice revenue is from the US foodservice business, which sells coffee and other related products to institutional foodservice companies with the majority of its sales through national broadline distribution networks.

During fiscal 2008, Starbucks derived 84% of total net revenues from its Company operated retail stores. Company operated retail revenues increased, primarily attributable to the opening of 681 new Company operated retail stores in fiscal 2008, offset by negative 3% comparable store sales for the same period. Revenue growth was slower than in previous years due to a combination of declining comparable store sales and a decrease in the number of net new stores opened during fiscal 2008. The weakness in consolidated comparable store sales was driven by the US segment, which posted a comparable store sales decline of 5% for the year. Partially offsetting this was 2% comparable store sales growth in the International segment. Within fiscal 2008, consolidated quarterly revenue growth decelerated each quarter and comparable store sales declined each quarter, reflecting the ongoing challenging economic conditions in the US. The Company derived the remaining 16% of total net revenues from specialty operations. Licensing revenues increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues from the opening of 988 new licensed retail stores in fiscal 2008. The increase in Foodservice and other revenues was primarily driven by growth in new and existing accounts in the foodservice business in the US. Sep 28, Sep 30, % Sep 28, Sep 30, Fiscal Year Ended 2008 2007 Change 2008 2007 % of Total Net Revenues Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 4,645.3 $ 3,999.1 16.2 % 44.7 % 42.5 % Store operating expenses 3,745.1 3,215.9 16.5 36.1 34.2 Other operating expenses 330.1 294.2 12.2 3.2 3.1 Depreciation and amortization expenses 549.3 467.2 17.6 5.3 5.0 General and administrative expenses 456.0 489.2 (6.8 ) 4.4 5.2 Restructuring charges 266.9 nm 2.6 Total operating expenses 9,992.7 8,465.6 18.0 96.2 89.9 Income from equity investees 113.6 108.0 5.2 1.1 1.1 Operating income $ 503.9 $ 1,053.9 (52.2 )% 4.9 % 11.2 % Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 42.7 % 40.2 % Other operating expenses 20.5 % 20.8 % Since many of the Companys operating expenses are fixed in nature, the softness in US revenues during fiscal 2008 impacted nearly all consolidated and US segment operating expense line items when viewed as a percentage of sales, and pressured operating margins. Cost of sales including occupancy costs increased primarily due to higher distribution costs and higher rent expenses as a percentage of revenues. Store operating expenses as a percentage of Company operated retail revenues increased primarily due to higher payroll expenditures as a percentage of revenues coupled with impairment provisions in the US business, primarily driven by the slowdown in projected store openings. Depreciation and amortization expenses increased primarily due to the opening of 681 new Company operated retail stores in fiscal 2008. General and administrative expenses decreased primarily due to lower payroll related expenses. Restructuring charges include asset impairment, lease exit and severance costs. These costs are associated with the closure of underperforming stores in the US and Australia, and the rationalization of the Companys leadership structure and non store organization. 29 Table of Contents Operating margin compression was primarily due to lower revenues; in addition, restructuring charges accounted for approximately 40% of the decrease. Sep 28, Sep 30, % Sep 28, Sep 30, Fiscal Year Ended 2008 2007 Change 2008 2007 % of Total Net Revenues Operating income $ 503.9 $ 1,053.9 (52.2 )% 4.9 % 11.2 % Interest income and other, net 9.0 40.4 (77.7 ) 0.1 0.4 Interest expense (53.4 ) (38.0 ) 40.5 (0.5 ) (0.4 ) Earnings before income taxes 459.5 1,056.3 (56.5 ) 4.4 11.2 Income taxes 144.0 383.7 (62.5 ) 1.4 4.1 Net earnings $ 315.5 $ 672.6 (53.1 )% 3.0 % 7.1 % Net interest income and other decreased due primarily to unrealized market value losses on the Companys trading securities portfolio. The trading securities approximate a portion of the Companys liability under its MDCP plan. The MDCP liability also increases and decreases with changes in investment performance, with this offsetting impact recorded in General and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings. Interest expense increased due to the Companys issuance of $550 million of 10 year 6.25% Senior Notes in August of fiscal 2007. Income taxes for fiscal 2008 resulted in an effective tax rate of 31.3% compared to 36.3% for fiscal 2007. The lower rate was due to the higher proportion of income earned in foreign jurisdictions which have lower tax rates, as well as an increase in the domestic manufacturing deduction for manufacturing activities in the US.

The US Company operated retail business continued to experience deteriorating trends in transactions during the year, driven by the US economic slowdown. Licensing revenues increased primarily due to higher product sales and royalty revenues as a result of opening 438 new licensed retail stores in fiscal 2008.

Restructuring charges of $210.9 million had a 280 basis point impact on the operating margin. The increase in cost of sales including occupancy costs was primarily due to higher distribution costs and higher rent expenses as a percentage of revenues. Higher store operating expenses was due to the softer sales, higher payroll related expenditures, and charges from canceling future store sites and asset impairments.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companys existing cash and liquid investments were $666.1 million and $322.3 million as of September 27, 2009 and September 28, 2008, respectively. The Company manages its cash and liquid investments in order to internally fund operating needs and make scheduled interest and principal payments on its borrowings. Included in the cash and liquid investment balances are the following: A portfolio of unrestricted trading securities, designed to hedge the Companys liability under the MDCP. The value of this portfolio was $44.8 million and $49.5 million as of September 27, 2009 and September 28, 2008, respectively. The decrease was primarily driven by declines in market values of the underlying equity funds. See Note 3 for further details. Unrestricted cash and liquid securities held within the Companys wholly owned captive insurance company to fund claim payouts. The value of these unrestricted cash and liquid securities was approximately $11.8 million and $24.0 million as of September 27, 2009 and September 28, 2008, respectively. 33 Table of Contents As of September 27, 2009, the Company had $92.7 million invested in available for sale securities. Included in available for sale securities were $55.7 million of auction rate securities (ARS), compared with $59.8 million of ARS held as of September 28, 2008, with the decrease due to calls of individual securities. As described in more detail in Note 3, while the ongoing auction failures will limit the liquidity of these investments for some period of time, the Company does not believe the auction failures will materially impact its ability to fund its working capital needs, capital expenditures or other business requirements. Credit rating agencies currently rate the Companys borrowings as follows: Description Standard Poors Moodys Short term debt A 2 P 3 Senior unsecured long term debt BBB Baa3 Outlook Stable Stable On August 28, 2009, Standard and Poors Ratings Services revised its outlook on the Companys credit ratings to stable from negative based on improved credit metrics and stabilizing performance. The rating agency also affirmed the BBB corporate credit rating on the Company and raised the short term rating to A 2 from A 3 to conform with the stable rating outlook. As a result of the Moodys P 3 short term rating issued in May 2009, commercial paper has become less liquid and more expensive than borrowing under the Companys credit facility. Consequently, the Company utilized its credit facility for almost all short term borrowing needs subsequent to May 2009. In the latter half of the year the Company reduced its total short term borrowings to a zero balance due to strong operating cash flows and lower capital spending on new Company operated stores. Management is unlikely to make significant use of its commercial paper program until its Moodys short term ratings improve. Despite limited access to the commercial paper markets, management believes that cash flow from operations and its existing cash and liquid investments, supplemented as needed by the $1 billion in short term borrowing capacity under the Companys revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to finance capital requirements for its core businesses for the foreseeable future, as well as to fund the cost of lease termination and related costs from the remaining international store closures. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. The Companys credit facility contains provisions requiring Starbucks to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. On June 8, 2009, the credit facility was amended to more accurately reflect the parties intent with respect to Amendment No. 4 to the credit facility. Amendment No. 5 to the credit facility did not impact the Companys borrowing terms, facility size, or covenant ratio, and was completed at minimal cost to the Company. As of September 27, 2009 and September 28, 2008, the Company was in compliance with each of these covenants. The $550 million of 10 year 6.25% Senior Notes, issued in fiscal 2007, also require Starbucks to maintain compliance with certain covenants that limit future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of September 27, 2009 and September 28, 2008, the Company was in compliance with each of these covenants. The Company generated strong operating cash flow during the year ended September 27, 2009 and used its free cash flow to reduce its short term borrowings from $713.0 million at the end of fiscal 2008 to a zero balance at the end of fiscal 2009 and to increase the balance of its cash and liquid investments. The Company expects to use its cash and liquid investments, including any borrowings under its credit facility and commercial paper program, to invest in its core businesses, including new beverage and product innovations, as well as other new business opportunities related to its core businesses. The Company may use its available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to its equity method and cost method investees. Any decisions to increase its ownership interest in its equity method investees or licensed operations will be driven by valuation and fit with the Companys ownership strategy and are likely to be infrequent. Depending on market conditions and within the constraint of maintaining an appropriate capital structure, Starbucks may repurchase shares of its common stock under its authorized share repurchase program. Starbucks 34 Table of Contents did not repurchase any shares in fiscal 2009 under the Companys share repurchase program; however, the Company will continue to evaluate share repurchases and cash dividends in the future as a use for excess cash generated by the business. Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2010 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for remodeling and refurbishment of, and equipment upgrades for, existing Company operated retail stores; systems and technology investments in the stores and in the support infrastructure; and new Company operated retail stores. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2010 are expected to range from $500 million to $550 million. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion for fiscal 2009 compared to $1.3 billion for fiscal 2008. Cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2009 totaled $421.1 million compared to $1.1 billion in fiscal 2008. The decrease was due to lower capital expenditures in fiscal 2009 compared to fiscal 2008 due to opening significantly fewer new Company operated stores. Cash used by financing activities for the year ended September 27, 2009 totaled $642.2 million, with net repayments of commercial paper and short term borrowings under the credit facility totaling $713.1 million. As of September 27, 2009, a total of $14.1 million in letters of credit were outstanding under the credit facility, leaving $985.9 million of capacity available under the $1 billion combined commercial paper program and revolving credit facility. The following table summarizes the Companys contractual obligations and borrowings as of September 27, 2009, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on the Companys liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by Period Less than 1 1 3 3 5 More than Contractual Obligations(1) Total Year Years Years 5 Years Debt obligations(2) $ 825.4 $ 34.7 $ 68.8 $ 68.8 $ 653.1 Operating lease obligations(3) 4,389.2 706.7 1,281.3 1,039.1 1,362.1 Purchase obligations(4) 308.3 264.1 34.2 9.5 0.5 Other obligations(5) 109.7 3.3 22.8 6.8 76.8 Total $ 5,632.6 $ 1,008.8 $ 1,407.1 $ 1,124.2 $ 2,092.5 (1) Income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions were excluded as the Company is not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments. As of September 27, 2009, the Company had $49.1 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. (2) Debt amounts include principal maturities and expected interest payments on the long term debt. (3) Amounts include the direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses. (4) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Purchase obligations relate primarily to green coffee. (5) Other obligations include other long term liabilities primarily consisting of asset retirement obligations, capital lease obligations and hedging instruments. Starbucks expects to fund these commitments primarily with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business, as well as ongoing borrowings under the combined commercial paper program and revolving credit facility. Off Balance Sheet Arrangement The Companys off balance sheet arrangements relate to certain guarantees and are detailed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this 10 K. 35 Table of Contents COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS Commodity price risk represents the Companys primary market risk, generated by its purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other things. The Company purchases, roasts and sells high quality whole bean arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, the Company also purchases significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of its Company operated retail stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts the Companys results of operations and can be expected to impact its future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10 K. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices, and interest rates. The Company manages its exposure to various market based risks according to an umbrella risk management policy. Under this policy, market based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The umbrella risk management policy governs the hedging instruments the business may use and limits the risk to net earnings. The Company also monitors and limits the amount of associated counterparty credit risk. Additionally, this policy restricts, among other things, the amount of market based risk the Company will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading activity. In general, hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years. The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point in time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses. Commodity Price Risk The Company purchases commodity inputs, including coffee, dairy products and diesel that are used in its operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact its financial results. In addition to fixed price contracts and price to be fixed contracts for coffee purchases, the Company has entered into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying commodity prices of its commodity hedges, as of the end of fiscal 2009, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The majority of the Companys revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in US dollars. However, because a portion of the Companys operations consists of activities outside of the US, the Company has transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, British pound, euro, and Japanese yen. As a result, Starbucks may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues, inventory purchases, assets, and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As of September 27, 2009, the Company had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases. In addition, Starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of its net investment in Starbucks Japan, as well as the Companys net investments in its Canada subsidiary, to minimize foreign currency exposure. The Company also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes (free standing derivatives), but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables. Increases or decreases in the fair value of these hedges are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the US dollar value of the Companys foreign currency denominated payables and receivables (i.e. hedged items) that would occur within the hedging period. The following table summarizes the potential impact to the Companys future net earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI) from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the 36 Table of Contents value of the US dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions): September 27, 2009 Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase in 10% Decrease in 10% Increase in 10% Decrease in Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Foreign currency hedges $ 58 (58 ) 13 (13 ) Equity Security Price Risk The Company has minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange traded funds within its trading portfolio. The trading securities approximate a portion of the Companys liability under the MDCP. A corresponding liability is included in Accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets. These investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in Net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings. The offsetting changes in the MDCP liability are recorded in General and administrative expenses. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of its investments as of the end of fiscal 2009, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. Interest Rate Risk The Company utilizes short term and long term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on its existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt. At the end of fiscal years 2009 and 2008, the Company did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding. The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates on the fair value of the Companys debt (in millions): September 27, 2009 Change in Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase in 100 Basis Point Decrease in Fair Value Underlying Rate Underlying Rate Debt $ 591.8 (39.8 ) 39.8 The Companys available for sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments. The primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity. As of September 27, 2009, the Companys long term available for sale securities included ARS. Please see Note 3 for further information. Available for sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income. The Company does not hedge the interest rate exposure on its available for sale securities. The Company performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of its available for sale securities as of the end of fiscal 2009, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the Companys financial condition and results, and require managements most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. 37 Table of Contents Starbucks considers its policies on asset impairment, stock based compensation, operating leases, self insurance reserves and income taxes to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements. Asset Impairment When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may be impaired, an evaluation of recoverability is performed by comparing the carrying values of the assets to projected future cash flows, in addition to other quantitative and qualitative analyses. For goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets, impairment tests are performed annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate carrying values exceed estimated fair values and if indefinite useful lives are no longer appropriate for the Companys trademarks. Upon determination that the carrying values of such assets are in excess of their estimated fair values, the Company recognizes an impairment loss as a charge against current operations. Judgments made by the Company related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability of the Company to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets, changes in economic conditions and changes in operating performance. As the Company assesses the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of its long lived assets, these factors could cause the Company to realize material impairment charges. Stock based Compensation Starbucks accounts for stock based compensation in accordance with fair value recognition provisions, under which the Company uses the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them (expected term), the estimated volatility of the Companys common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not complete their vesting requirements. Changes in the subjective assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation; however based on an analysis using changes in certain assumptions that could be reasonably possible in the near term, management believes the effect on the expense recognized for fiscal 2009 would not have been material. Operating Leases Starbucks leases retail stores, roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases. The Company provides for an estimate of asset retirement obligation (ARO) expense at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term. Estimating AROs involves subjective assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs. Future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated. In addition, the large number of operating leases and the significant number of international markets in which the Company has operating leases adds administrative complexity to the calculation of ARO expense, as well as to the other technical accounting requirements of operating leases such as contingent rent. Estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions, including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income. The estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate. Self Insurance Reserves The Company uses a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance pool, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including workers compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance, and director and officers liability insurance. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by the Company are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. 38 Table of Contents Income Taxes Starbucks recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities and accrues for uncertain tax positions. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse. Judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and related accruals, deferred tax assets and liabilities. These include establishing a valuation allowance related to the ability to realize certain deferred tax assets. Accounting for uncertain tax positions requires significant judgments, including estimating the amount, timing and likelihood of ultimate settlement. Although the Company believes that its estimates are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates.
