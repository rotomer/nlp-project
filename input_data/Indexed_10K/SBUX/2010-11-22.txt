Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations General Starbucks Corporations fiscal year ends on the Sunday closest to September 30. The fiscal year ended on October 3, 2010 included 53 weeks with the 53rd week falling in our fourth fiscal quarter. Fiscal years ended on September 27, 2009 and September 28, 2008 both included 52 weeks. Comparable store sales percentages below are calculated excluding the 53rd week. All references to store counts, including data for new store openings, are reported net of related store closures, unless otherwise noted. Financial Highlights Consolidated operating income was $1.4 billion for fiscal 2010 compared to $562 million in fiscal 2009, and the operating margin increased to 13.3% compared to 5.7% in fiscal 2009. The operating margin expansion was driven by increased sales leverage and the continued benefits from operational efficiencies. Comparable store sales growth at company operated stores was 7% in fiscal 2010 compared to a decline of 6% in fiscal 2009. Lower restructuring charges in fiscal 2010 compared to the prior year also contributed approximately 290 basis points of the increase in operating margin. EPS for fiscal 2010 was $1.24, compared to EPS of $0.52 reported in fiscal 2009, with the increase driven by the improved sales leverage and the continued benefits from operational efficiencies. Restructuring charges impacted EPS by approximately $0.04 per share in fiscal 2010 and approximately $0.28 in fiscal 2009. Cash flow from operations was $1.7 billion in fiscal 2010 compared to $1.4 billion in fiscal 2009, and capital expenditures were approximately $440 million in both fiscal years. Available operating cash flow after capital expenditures during fiscal 2010 was directed at returning approximately $460 million of cash to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends, and investing in short term investment grade securities. Overview Starbucks results for fiscal 2010 demonstrate the ongoing success of our efforts over the last two years to improve the health of our core business and to position the Company for sustained, profitable growth into the future. Strong comparable stores sales growth of 7% for the year (US 7% and International 6%), combined with a more efficient operating structure drove increased sales leverage and resulted in higher operating margins and net earnings. The operational improvements implemented throughout fiscal 2009 in our supply chain and company operated stores have driven reduced product costs and store waste as well as in store labor savings, concurrent with improved customer satisfaction scores. These improvements were partially offset by higher performance based compensation expenses in fiscal 2010 and by higher marketing expenses to support the launch of Starbucks VIA&reg; Ready Brew in the grocery channel and the introduction of our new customizable Frappuccino&reg; blended beverage. In our US business we will continue to refine our store efficiency efforts while pursuing a consistently high level of customer satisfaction. While the reinvigorated US business has been the primary driver of Starbucks improved consolidated financial results, the profitability of our international business continues to improve, driven primarily by increased sales leverage and supply chain efficiencies. Our management continues to focus on our international business by leveraging the valuable lessons learned in the US. We intend to capitalize on the large expansion opportunities that exist outside the US, including continued growth and scale in our more mature existing markets, and emphasis on expansion in key emerging markets like China and Brazil. Our global consumer products group (CPG) represents another important profitable growth opportunity for us as we accelerate both product innovation and distribution. We are aggressively pursuing the opportunities beyond our more traditional store experience to offer consumers new coffee products in multiple forms, across new categories, and through diverse channels, leveraging our strong brand and established retail store base. Examples include the ongoing expansion of our successful Starbucks VIA&reg; Ready Brew product and the ongoing growth in points of distribution for Seattles Best Coffee. Starbucks continues to generate strong operating cash flows, which provide us the financial flexibility to continue disciplined investment and spending in both our core business and new growth platforms, while also returning cash 22 Table of Contents to shareholders. We generated $1.7 billion of operating cash flow in fiscal 2010 and finished the year with $1.4 billion in cash and short term investments and no short term debt. In fiscal 2010 we returned approximately $460 million of cash to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends. Fiscal 2011 The View Ahead For fiscal 2011, we expect revenues to grow in the mid to high single digits based on a 52 week comparable year, driven by low to mid single digit comparable store sales growth. We plan to open approximately 500 net new stores globally in fiscal 2011; approximately 100 in the U.S. and approximately 400 internationally, the majority of which are expected to be licensed stores. We expect modest improvement in our consolidated operating margin in fiscal 2011 compared to the prior year, given our current revenue expectations, our anticipation of no restructuring charges in fiscal 2011, along with ongoing marketing spend for Starbucks VIA&reg; Ready Brew and higher coffee commodity costs. We expect capital expenditures to be approximately $550 million to $600 million for the full year. Operating Segment Overview Starbucks has three reportable operating segments: US, International, and CPG. In the fourth fiscal quarter of 2010, we changed the composition of our reportable segments by creating a Seattles Best Coffee operating segment and reporting it with our unallocated corporate expenses and Digital Ventures in Other. Financial information for Seattles Best Coffee was previously reported within the US, International, and CPG segments. The US and International segments both include company operated retail stores and licensed retail stores. Licensed stores generally have a higher operating margin than company operated stores. Under the licensed model, Starbucks receives a reduced share of the total store revenues, but this is more than offset by the reduction in its share of costs as these are primarily borne by the licensee. The International segment has a higher relative share of licensed stores versus company operated compared to the US segment; however, the US segment has been operating significantly longer than the International segment and has developed deeper awareness of, and attachment to, the Starbucks brand and stores among its customer base. As a result, the more mature US segment has significantly more stores, and higher total revenues than the International segment. Average sales per store are also higher in the US due to various factors including length of time in market and local income levels. Further, certain market costs, particularly occupancy costs, are lower in the US segment compared to the average for the International segment, which comprises a more diverse group of operations. As a result of the relative strength of the brand in the US segment, the number of stores, the higher unit volumes, and the lower market costs, the US segment, despite its higher relative percentage of company operated stores, has a higher operating margin, excluding restructuring costs, than the less developed International segment. Starbucks International store base continues to expand and as we continue to focus on achieving sustainable growth from established international markets while at the same time investing in emerging markets, such as China and Brazil. Newer international markets require a more extensive support organization, relative to the current levels of revenue and operating income. The CPG segment includes packaged coffee and tea and other branded products operations worldwide, and the US foodservice business. For over ten years through licensing relationships with Kraft Foods Global, Inc., we have sold a selection of Starbucks and Seattles Best Coffee branded packaged coffees and Tazo&reg; teas in grocery and warehouse club stores throughout the US, and to grocery stores in Canada, the UK and other European countries. Kraft has managed the distribution, marketing, advertising and promotion of these products. In the first quarter of fiscal 2011, Starbucks notified Kraft that we are discontinuing our licensing relationships. We intend to work closely with Kraft to ensure an orderly transition. We also sell packaged coffee and tea internationally directly to warehouse club stores, such as Costco Wholesale Corporation. Our CPG segment also includes ready to drink beverages which are manufactured and distributed through The North American Coffee Partnership, a joint venture with the Pepsi Cola Company. In the CPG segment, most of the customer revenues from the packaged coffee and ready to drink products are recognized as revenues by the licensed or joint venture business partner. Royalties and payments from our licensing agreements are recorded under licensing revenue, and the proportionate share of the results of the joint venture are included, on a net basis, in 23 Table of Contents income from equity investees on the consolidated statements of earnings. The US foodservice business sells coffee and other related products to institutional foodservice companies with the majority of its sales through national broadline distribution networks. The CPG segment reflects relatively lower revenues, a modest cost structure, and a resulting higher operating margin, compared to the other two reporting segments, which consist primarily of retail stores.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FISCAL 2010 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009 Consolidated results of operations (in millions): Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 %Change Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 % of Total NetRevenues Net revenues: Company operated retail $ 8,963.5 $ 8,180.1 9.6 % 83.7 % 83.7 % Specialty: Licensing 1,340.9 1,222.3 9.7 % 12.5 % 12.5 % Foodservice and other 403.0 372.2 8.3 % 3.8 % 3.8 % Total specialty 1,743.9 1,594.5 9.4 % 16.3 % 16.3 % Total net revenues $ 10,707.4 $ 9,774.6 9.5 % 100.0 % 100.0 % Consolidated net revenues were $10.7 billion for fiscal 2010, an increase of 9.5% over fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily due to an increase in company operated retail revenues driven by a 7% increase in global comparable stores sales (contributing approximately $551 million). The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 4% increase in number of transactions (contributing approximately $298 million) and a 3% increase in average value per transaction (contributing approximately $253 million). Also contributing to the increase in revenues was the extra week in fiscal 2010 (approximately $207 million), foreign currency translation resulting from the weakening of the US dollar primarily in relation to the Canadian dollar (approximately $101 million), and the effect of consolidating our previous joint venture in France (approximately $87 million). This increase was partially offset by a net decrease of 72 company operated stores from fiscal 2009 (approximately $119 million). Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 % of Total NetRevenues Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 4,458.6 $ 4,324.9 41.6 % 44.2 % Store operating expenses 3,551.4 3,425.1 33.2 % 35.0 % Other operating expenses 293.2 264.4 2.7 % 2.7 % Depreciation and amortization expenses 510.4 534.7 4.8 % 5.5 % General and administrative expenses 569.5 453.0 5.3 % 4.6 % Restructuring charges 53.0 332.4 0.5 % 3.4 % Total operating expenses 9,436.1 9,334.5 88.1 % 95.5 % Income from equity investees 148.1 121.9 1.4 % 1.2 % Operating income $ 1,419.4 $ 562.0 13.3 % 5.7 % Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 39.6 % 41.9 % Other operating expenses 16.8 % 16.6 % 24 Table of Contents Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenues decreased 260 basis points. The decrease was primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies which contributed to lower food costs (approximately 70 basis points) and lower beverage and paper packaging product costs (approximately 50 basis points). Also contributing to the decrease were lower occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues (approximately 80 basis points) primarily due to sales leverage. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company operated retail revenues decreased 230 basis points primarily due to increased sales leverage from increased revenues. Restructuring charges include lease exit and related costs associated with the actions to rationalize our global store portfolio and reduce the global cost structure in fiscal 2009 and 2008. The restructuring charges incurred in fiscal 2010 reflect charges incurred on the previously announced store closures. With the previously announced store closures essentially complete, we do not expect to report any further restructuring costs related to these activities. Partially offsetting these favorable fluctuations were increased advertising costs included primarily in other operating expenses and higher performance based compensation expenses, which drove the 70 basis point increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues. Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 % of Total NetRevenues Operating income $ 1,419.4 $ 562.0 13.3 % 5.7 % Interest income and other, net 50.3 37.0 0.5 % 0.4 % Interest expense (32.7 ) (39.1 ) (0.3 )% (0.4 )% Earnings before income taxes 1,437.0 559.9 13.4 % 5.7 % Income taxes 488.7 168.4 4.6 % 1.7 % Net earnings including noncontrolling interests 948.3 391.5 8.9 % 4.0 % Net earnings (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests 2.7 0.7 0 0 Net earnings attributable to Starbucks $ 945.6 $ 390.8 8.8 % 4.0 % Effective tax rate including noncontrolling interests 34.0 % 30.1 % Net interest income and other increased $13 million over the prior period. The increase was driven by the impact of an accounting gain recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2010 related to our acquisition of a controlling interest in our previous joint venture operations in France. In accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP), the carrying value of the previously held joint venture interest was adjusted to fair value upon the acquisition of the controlling interest. Also contributing to the increase were favorable fluctuations in unrealized holding gains on our trading securities portfolio of approximately $10 million. The trading securities approximate a portion of the Companys liability under the Management Deferred Compensation Plan (MDCP). The MDCP liability also increases and decreases with changes in investment performance, with this offsetting impact recorded in general and administrative expenses on the consolidated statements of earnings. This favorability was partially offset by unfavorable foreign currency fluctuations (approximately $11 million), which relate primarily to the revaluation of certain trade payables and receivables. Income taxes for the fiscal year ended 2010 resulted in an effective tax rate of 34.0% compared to 30.1% for fiscal 2009. The lower rate in fiscal 2009 was primarily due to the benefits recognized for retroactive tax credits and an audit settlement. The effective tax rate for fiscal 2011 is expected to be in the range of 34% to 35%. 25 Table of Contents Operating Segments The following tables summarize the Companys results of operations by segment for fiscal 2010 and 2009 (in millions). United States Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 As a % of US TotalNet Revenues Total net revenues $ 7,560.4 $ 7,061.7 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 2,906.1 $ 2,941.4 38.4 % 41.7 % Store operating expenses 2,831.9 2,815.1 37.5 % 39.9 % Other operating expenses 55.6 66.6 0.7 % 0.9 % Depreciation and amortization expenses 350.7 377.9 4.6 % 5.4 % General and administrative expenses 97.8 84.8 1.3 % 1.2 % Restructuring charges 27.2 246.3 0.4 % 3.5 % Total operating expenses 6,269.3 6,532.1 82.9 % 92.5 % Income from equity investees 0.0 0.5 0.0 % 0.0 % Operating income $ 1,291.1 $ 530.1 17.1 % 7.5 % Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 40.3 % 42.8 % Other operating expenses 10.5 % 13.6 % US net revenues increased primarily due to an increase in company operated retail revenues of 7%. This increase is primarily due to a 7% increase in comparable store sales (contributing approximately $452 million), comprised of a 3% increase in transactions (contributing approximately $222 million), and a 4% increase in average value per transaction (contributing approximately $230 million). Also contributing to the increase in total net revenues was the extra week in fiscal 2010 (approximately $143 million), partially offset by a net decrease of 57 company operated stores from fiscal 2009 (approximately $125 million). Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenues decreased by 330 basis points over the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by supply chain efficiencies which contributed to lower food costs (approximately 90 basis points) and lower beverage and paper packaging product costs (approximately 60 basis points). Also contributing to the decrease were lower occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues (approximately 100 basis points) primarily due to sales leverage. Store operating expenses as a percent of related retail revenues decreased 250 basis points primarily due to increased sales leverage. Restructuring charges include lease exit and related costs associated with the actions to rationalize our global store portfolio. Restructuring charges in fiscal 2010 decreased $219 million from 2009 due to the completion of our restructuring efforts in the US during the current year. 26 Table of Contents International Fiscal Year Ended Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 Oct 3,2010 Sep 27,2009 As a % ofInternational TotalNet Revenues Total net revenues $ 2,288.8 $ 1,914.3 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 1,078.2 $ 961.3 47.1 % 50.2 % Store operating expenses 719.5 610.0 31.4 % 31.9 % Other operating expenses 85.7 71.2 3.7 % 3.7 % Depreciation and amortization expenses 108.6 102.2 4.7 % 5.3 % General and administrative expenses 126.6 105.0 5.5 % 5.5 % Restructuring charges 25.8 27.0 1.1 % 1.4 % Total operating expenses 2,144.4 1,876.7 93.7 % 98.0 % Income from equity investees 80.8 53.6 3.5 % 2.8 % Operating income $ 225.2 $ 91.2 9.8 % 4.8 % Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 37.2 % 37.9 % Other operating expenses 24.0 % 23.2 % International net revenues increased due to foreign currency translation resulting from the weakening of the US dollar primarily in relation to the Canadian dollar (approximately $101 million), comparable store sales of 6% (contributing approximately $99 million), the effect of consolidating our previous joint venture in France (approximately $87 million), and the extra week in fiscal 2010 (approximately $45 million). The increase in comparable store sales was due to a 5% increase in transactions (contributing approximately $78 million), and a 1% increase in average value per transaction (contributing approximately $21 million). Cost of sales including occupancy costs as a percentage of total revenues decreased by 310 basis points compared to the prior year. The decrease was primarily driven by lower costs for food and beverage components resulting from supply chain efficiencies (approximately 120 basis points). Also contributing to the decrease were lower occupancy costs as a percentage of total net revenues (approximately 120 basis points) primarily due to sales leverage. Store operating expenses as a percent of related retail revenues decreased 70 basis points primarily due to reduced impairments in fiscal 2010 compared to fiscal 2009. Restructuring charges include lease exit and related costs associated with the actions to rationalize our global store portfolio. Restructuring charges in fiscal 2010 decreased slightly from 2009 due to the completion of our restructuring efforts internationally by the end of the current year.

The increase in revenues for Seattles Best Coffee was primarily due to sales to new national accounts (contributing approximately $13 million). Operating expenses included in Other relate to Seattles Best Coffee and Digital Ventures as well as expenses pertaining to corporate administrative functions that support our operating segments but are not specifically attributable to or managed by any segment and are not included in the reported financial results of the operating segments. Total operating expenses increased $40.5 million primarily as a result of increased general and administrative expenses ($80 million) primarily due to higher performance based compensation in 2010. This increase was partially offset by a decrease of $58 million in restructuring charges due to the completion of our restructuring activities within the non store support organization.

Foreign currency translation also contributed to the decline with the effects of a stronger US dollar relative to the British pound and Canadian dollar. The weakness in consolidated comparable store sales was driven by the US segment, with a comparable store sales decline of 6% for the year. The International segment experienced a 2% decline in comparable store sales. 28 Table of Contents Fiscal Year Ended Sep 27,2009 Sep 28,2008 Sep 27,2009 Sep 28,2008 % of Total NetRevenues Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 4,324.9 $ 4,645.3 44.2 % 44.7 % Store operating expenses 3,425.1 3,745.1 35.0 % 36.1 % Other operating expenses 264.4 330.1 2.7 % 3.2 % Depreciation and amortization expenses 534.7 549.3 5.5 % 5.3 % General and administrative expenses 453.0 456.0 4.6 % 4.4 % Restructuring charges 332.4 266.9 3.4 % 2.6 % Total operating expenses 9,334.5 9,992.7 95.5 % 96.2 % Income from equity investees 121.9 113.6 1.2 % 1.1 % Operating income $ 562.0 $ 503.9 5.7 % 4.9 % Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 41.9 % 42.7 % Other operating expenses 16.6 % 20.5 % Cost of sales including occupancy costs decreased as a percentage of revenues primarily due to the implementation of in store operational efficiencies designed to reduce product waste, and due to lower dairy costs in the US, partially offset by higher coffee costs. Store operating expenses as a percentage of company operated retail revenues decreased primarily due to reduced headcount and spending in the regional support organization as a result of our restructuring efforts, and the effect of initiatives to improve store labor efficiencies. Restructuring charges include lease exit and related costs associated with the actions to rationalize our global store portfolio and reduce the global cost structure. Operating margin expansion was primarily due to the improved labor efficiency and reduced product waste in company operated stores, partially offset by increased restructuring charges.

Also contributing to the increase were lower unrealized market value losses on our trading securities portfolio compared to fiscal 2008. Interest expense decreased due to a lower average balance of short term borrowings and lower average short term borrowing rates in fiscal 2009 compared to the prior year. At the end of fiscal 2009, we had no short term debt. The relatively low 2009 effective tax rate was primarily due to a tax benefit recognized for retroactive tax credits and an income tax credit related to the settlement of an employment tax audit in fiscal 2009. As a result of the audit settlement, approximately $17 million of expense was recorded in store operating expenses, with an offsetting income tax credit and no impact to net earnings. 29 Table of Contents United States Fiscal Year Ended Sep 27,2009 Sep 28,2008 Sep 27,2009 Sep 28,2008 As a % of US TotalNet Revenues Total net revenues $ 7,061.7 $ 7,491.2 100.0 % 100.0 % Cost of sales including occupancy costs $ 2,941.4 $ 3,184.1 41.7 % 42.5 % Store operating expenses 2,815.1 3,080.9 39.9 % 41.1 % Other operating expenses 66.6 95.6 0.9 % 1.3 % Depreciation and amortization expenses 377.9 395.1 5.4 % 5.3 % General and administrative expenses 84.8 69.3 1.2 % 0.9 % Restructuring charges 246.3 210.9 3.5 % 2.8 % Total operating expenses 6,532.1 7,035.9 92.5 % 93.9 % Income from equity investees 0.5 (1.3 ) 0.0 % 0.0 % Operating income $ 530.1 $ 454.0 7.5 % 6.1 % Supplemental ratios as a % of related revenues: Store operating expenses 42.8 % 44.0 % Other operating expenses 13.6 % 19.4 % Company operated retail revenues decreased year over year primarily due to a 6% decrease in comparable store sales, comprised of a 4% decrease in transactions, and a 2% decrease in average value per transaction. Operating margin expanded primarily due to lower store operating expenses, lower cost of sales including occupancy costs, and lower other operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues. This improvement was primarily due to operational changes designed to improve labor efficiency and reduce product waste in company operated stores, and to lower non store support costs. Partially offsetting the favorability were higher restructuring charges during the year. We incurred higher lease exit and related costs due to the higher number of actual store closures compared to the prior year period.

Partially offsetting the decrease were the net new store openings during the fiscal year. Specialty revenues decreased primarily due to continued softness in the hospitality industry and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rates. Operating margin decreased primarily due to higher restructuring charges and higher store operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues. Restructuring charges of $27.0 million recognized during the year had a 50 basis point impact on operating margin compared to the prior year, due to the previously announced store closures. Higher store operating expenses as of percentage of company operated retail revenues were driven by an increase in store impairment charges and a decline in sales leverage impacting salaries and benefits. Partially offsetting the decrease in operating margin were lower other operating expenses due to headcount reductions in the non store support functions.

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Starbucks cash and short term investments were $1.4 billion and $666 million as of October 3, 2010 and September 27, 2009, respectively. We actively manage our cash and short term investments in order to internally fund operating needs, make scheduled interest and principal payments on our borrowings, and return cash to shareholders through common stock dividend payments and share repurchases. Our short term investments consisted predominantly of US Treasury and US Agency securities. Our portfolio of long term available for sale securities consists predominantly of high investment grade corporate bonds, diversified among industries and individual issuers. We also have investments in auction rate securities (ARS), nearly all of which are classified as long term. ARS totaling $41 million and $56 million were outstanding as of October 3, 2010 and September 27, 2009, respectively. The reduction in ARS was due to $12 million in redemptions during the fiscal year with all redemptions done at par. While the ongoing auction failures will limit the liquidity of these ARS investments for some period of time, we do not believe the auction failures will materially impact our ability to fund our working capital needs, capital expenditures, shareholder dividends or other business requirements. Starbucks $1 billion unsecured credit facility (the 2005 credit facility) was available for working capital, capital expenditures, and other corporate purposes. In November of 2010, subsequent to the end of the 2010 fiscal year, we replaced the 2005 credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in August 2011. The new credit facility is described in more detail below. The 2005 credit facility was paired with a commercial paper program whereby we could issue unsecured commercial paper notes, up to a maximum amount outstanding at any time of $1 billion. The commercial paper program was secured by the credit facility, and the combined borrowing limit was $1 billion for the commercial paper program and the credit facility. During fiscal 2010 and 2009, there were no borrowings under the 2005 credit facility or commercial paper program. As of October 3, 2010, a total of $15 million in letters of credit were outstanding under our revolving credit facility. The 2005 credit facility contained provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio. As of October 3, 2010 and September 27, 2009, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. The $550 million of 10 year 6.25% Senior Notes also require us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including limits on future liens and sale and leaseback transactions on certain material properties. As of October 3, 2010 and September 27, 2009, we were in compliance with each of these covenants. In November of 2010, subsequent to the end of the 2010 fiscal year, we replaced the 2005 credit facility with a $500 million unsecured credit facility (the 2010 credit facility) with various banks, of which $100 million may be 32 Table of Contents used for issuances of letters of credit. The 2010 credit facility is available for working capital, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. The new 2010 credit facility is currently set to mature in November 2014. The interest rate for any borrowings under the credit facility, based on Starbucks current ratings and fixed charge coverage ratio, is 1.50% over LIBOR. The specific spread over LIBOR will depend upon our long term credit ratings assigned by Moodys and Standard & Poors rating agencies and our fixed charge coverage ratio. The credit facility contains provisions requiring us to maintain compliance with certain covenants, including a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio which measures our ability to cover financing expenses. Starbucks has the option, subject to negotiation and agreement with the related banks, to increase the maximum commitment amount by an additional $500 million. Under Starbucks commercial paper program we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes, up to a maximum aggregate amount outstanding at any time of $500 million, with individual maturities that may vary, but not exceed 397 days from the date of issue. The program is backstopped by the 2010 credit facility, and the combined borrowing limit is $500 million for the commercial paper program and the credit facility. Starbucks may issue commercial paper from time to time, and the proceeds of the commercial paper financing will be used for working capital needs, capital expenditures and other corporate purposes, including acquisitions and share repurchases. We expect to use our cash and short term investments, including any potential future borrowings under the credit facility and commercial paper program, to invest in our core businesses, including new product innovations and related marketing support, as well as other new business opportunities related to our core businesses. We believe that cash flow generated from operations and existing cash and short term investments should be sufficient to finance capital requirements for our core businesses as well as shareholder distributions for the foreseeable future. We may use our available cash resources to make proportionate capital contributions to our equity method and cost method investees. Any decisions to increase ownership interest in our equity method investees or licensed operations will be driven by valuation and fit with our ownership strategy. Significant new joint ventures, acquisitions and or other new business opportunities may require additional outside funding. Other than normal operating expenses, cash requirements for fiscal 2011 are expected to consist primarily of capital expenditures for remodeling and refurbishment of, and equipment upgrades for, existing company operated retail stores; systems and technology investments in the stores and in the support infrastructure; and new company operated retail stores. Total capital expenditures for fiscal 2011 are expected to range from $550 million to $600 million. In March 2010, Starbucks declared its first ever cash dividend to shareholders at $0.10 per share. This quarterly dividend was paid on April 23, 2010. The third quarter dividend was raised to $0.13 per share and was paid on August 20, 2010, bringing the total cash dividend payout for fiscal 2010 to $171 million. On September 14, 2010, we declared a cash dividend of $0.13 per share to be paid on December 3, 2010 with an expected payout of $97 million. Starbucks repurchased 11 million shares of common stock ($286 million) during fiscal 2010 under share repurchase authorizations. The number of remaining shares authorized for repurchase at the end of the fiscal year totaled 10 million. Subsequent to year end, on November 15, 2010 we announced an additional share repurchase authorization made by the Board of Directors in the amount of up to 10 million shares in addition to the 10 million remaining under the previous authorization. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.7 billion for fiscal 2010 as compared to $1.4 billion for fiscal 2009. The increase was primarily due to higher net earnings for the period. Cash used by investing activities for fiscal 2010 totaled $790 million as compared to $421 million in fiscal 2009. The increase results primarily from the use of a portion of our available cash balances to purchase US Agency and investment grade bonds. Capital expenditures in fiscal 2010 totaled $441 million, primarily for remodeling and renovating existing company operated retail stores, opening new retail stores, and investment in information technology systems. Cash used by financing activities for fiscal 2010 totaled $346 million as compared to $642 million in fiscal 2009. The change primarily reflects net repayments of commercial paper and short term borrowings under the credit facility totaling $713 million in fiscal 2009, offset by dividend payments of $171 million and common share repurchases of $286 million in fiscal 2010. 33 Table of Contents The following table summarizes our contractual obligations and borrowings as of October 3, 2010, and the timing and effect that such commitments are expected to have on our liquidity and capital requirements in future periods (in millions): Payments Due by Period Contractual Obligations(1) Total Less than1 Year 1 3Years 3 5Years More than5 Years Operating lease obligations(2) $ 4,084.2 $ 718.4 $ 1,279.4 $ 1,006.6 $ 1,079.8 Debt obligations(3) 790.8 34.4 68.8 68.8 618.8 Purchase obligations(4) 613.2 556.7 52.3 4.2 0.0 Other obligations(5) 107.7 1.8 22.3 9.5 74.1 Total $ 5,595.9 $ 1,311.3 $ 1,422.8 $ 1,089.1 $ 1,772.7 (1) Income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions were excluded as we are not able to make a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount and period of related future payments. As of October 3, 2010, we had $68.4 million of gross unrecognized tax benefits for uncertain tax positions. (2) Amounts include the direct lease obligations, excluding any taxes, insurance and other related expenses. (3) Debt amounts include principal maturities and scheduled interest payments on our long term debt. (4) Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding on Starbucks and that specify all significant terms. Purchase obligations relate primarily to green coffee, with these amounts comprising approximately 90% of the total of this item. (5) Other obligations include other long term liabilities primarily consisting of asset retirement obligations, capital lease obligations and hedging instruments. Starbucks currently expects to fund these commitments with operating cash flows generated in the normal course of business. Off Balance Sheet Arrangement Off balance sheet arrangements relate to certain guarantees and are detailed in Note 17 to the consolidated financial statements in this 10 K. COMMODITY PRICES, AVAILABILITY AND GENERAL RISK CONDITIONS Commodity price risk represents Starbucks primary market risk, generated by our purchases of green coffee and dairy products, among other things. We purchase, roast and sell high quality whole bean arabica coffee and related products and risk arises from the price volatility of green coffee. In addition to coffee, we also purchases significant amounts of dairy products to support the needs of our company operated retail stores. The price and availability of these commodities directly impacts our results of operations and can be expected to impact our future results of operations. For additional details see Product Supply in Item 1, as well as Risk Factors in Item 1A of this 10 K. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT Market risk is defined as the risk of losses due to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, equity security prices, and interest rates. We manage our exposure to various market based risks according to an umbrella risk management policy. Under this policy, market based risks are quantified and evaluated for potential mitigation strategies, such as entering into hedging transactions. The umbrella risk management policy governs the hedging instruments the business may use and limits the risk to net earnings. We also monitor and limit the amount of associated counterparty credit risk. Additionally, this policy restricts, among other things, the amount of market based risk we will tolerate before implementing approved hedging strategies and prohibits speculative trading activity. In general, hedging instruments do not have maturities in excess of five years. 34 Table of Contents The sensitivity analyses disclosed below provide only a limited, point in time view of the market risk of the financial instruments discussed. The actual impact of the respective underlying rates and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analyses. Commodity Price Risk We purchase commodity inputs, including coffee, dairy products and diesel that are used in our operations and are subject to price fluctuations that impact our financial results. In addition to fixed price and price to be fixed contracts for coffee purchases, we have entered into commodity hedges to manage commodity price risk using financial derivative instruments. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying commodity prices of our commodity hedges, as of the end of fiscal 2010, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk The majority of our revenue, expense and capital purchasing activities are transacted in US dollars. However, because a portion of our operations consists of activities outside of the US, we have transactions in other currencies, primarily the Canadian dollar, British pound, euro, and Japanese yen. As a result, we may engage in transactions involving various derivative instruments to hedge revenues, inventory purchases, assets, and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies. As of October 3, 2010, Starbucks had forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge portions of anticipated international revenue streams and inventory purchases. In addition, we had forward foreign exchange contracts that qualify as accounting hedges of our net investment in Starbucks Japan to minimize foreign currency exposure. Starbucks also had forward foreign exchange contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes (free standing derivatives), but which largely offset the financial impact of translating certain foreign currency denominated payables and receivables. Increases or decreases in the fair value of these hedges are generally offset by corresponding decreases or increases in the US dollar value of our foreign currency denominated payables and receivables (i.e. hedged items) that would occur within the hedging period. The following table summarizes the potential impact to Starbucks future net earnings and other comprehensive income (OCI) from changes in the fair value of these derivative financial instruments due in turn to a change in the value of the US dollar as compared to the level of foreign exchange rates. The information provided below relates only to the hedging instruments and does not represent the corresponding changes in the underlying hedged items (in millions): October 3, 2010 Increase/(Decrease) to Net Earnings Increase/(Decrease) to OCI 10% Increase inUnderlying Rate 10% Decrease inUnderlying Rate 10% Increase inUnderlying Rate 10% Decrease inUnderlying Rate Foreign currency hedges $ 46 $ (46 ) $ 13 $ (13 ) Equity Security Price Risk We have minimal exposure to price fluctuations on equity mutual funds and equity exchange traded funds within our trading portfolio. The trading securities approximate a portion of our liability under the MDCP. A corresponding liability is included in accrued compensation and related costs on the consolidated balance sheets. These investments are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recognized in net interest income and other in the consolidated statements of earnings. The offsetting changes in the MDCP liability are recorded in general and administrative expenses. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 10% change in the underlying equity prices of our investments as of the end of fiscal 2010 and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. 35 Table of Contents Interest Rate Risk We utilize short term and long term financing and may use interest rate hedges to manage the effect of interest rate changes on our existing debt as well as the anticipated issuance of new debt. At the end of fiscal years 2010 and 2009, we did not have any interest rate hedge agreements outstanding. The following table summarizes the impact of a change in interest rates on the fair value of Starbucks debt (in millions): October 3, 2010 Change in Fair Value Fair Value 100 Basis Point Increase inUnderlying Rate 100 Basis Point Decrease inUnderlying Rate Debt $ 637 $ (36 ) $ 36 Our available for sale securities comprise a diversified portfolio consisting mainly of fixed income instruments. The primary objectives of these investments are to preserve capital and liquidity. As of October 3, 2010, our long term available for sale securities included ARS. Please see Note 3 for further information. Available for sale securities are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. We do not hedge the interest rate exposure on our available for sale securities. We performed a sensitivity analysis based on a 100 basis point change in the underlying interest rate of our available for sale securities as of the end of fiscal 2010, and determined that such a change would not have a significant effect on the fair value of these instruments. APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require the most difficult, subjective or complex judgments, often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain. Judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions. We consider our policies on asset impairment, goodwill, stock based compensation, operating leases, self insurance reserves and income taxes to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements. Asset Impairment When facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying values of long lived assets may not be recoverable, we evaluate long lived assets for impairment. We first compare the carrying value of the asset to the assets estimated future cash flows (undiscounted). If the estimated future cash flows are less than the carrying value of the asset, we calculate an impairment loss based on the assets estimated fair value. For store assets, the fair value of the assets is estimated using a discounted cash flow model based on future store revenues and operating costs, using internal projections. For other assets, we use the valuation approach that is appropriate given the relevant facts and circumstances. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate future cash flows and asset fair values, including forecasting asset useful lives. Further, our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying values of our assets is affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvement of the assets, changes in economic conditions, and changes in operating performance. As we periodically reassess estimated future cash flows and asset fair values, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future. 36 Table of Contents Goodwill Impairment We test goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if circumstances, such as material deterioration in performance or a significant number of store closures, indicate reporting unit carrying values may exceed their fair values. If the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied estimated fair value, an impairment charge to current operations is recorded to reduce the carrying value to the implied estimated fair value. We conduct our annual goodwill impairment test for consolidated entities in our third fiscal quarter. Our impairment loss calculations contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of our reporting units, including estimating future cash flows, and if necessary, the fair value of a reporting units assets and liabilities. Further, our ability to realize the future cash flows used in our fair value calculations is affected by factors such as changes in economic conditions, changes in our operating performance, and changes in our business strategies. As we periodically reassess our fair value calculations, including estimated future cash flows, changes in our estimates and assumptions may cause us to realize material impairment charges in the future. As a part of Starbucks ongoing operations, we may close certain stores within a reporting unit containing goodwill due to underperformance of the store or inability to renew our lease, among other reasons. We abandon certain assets associated with a closed store including leasehold improvements and other non transferrable assets. Under GAAP, when a portion of a reporting unit that constitutes a business is to be disposed of, goodwill associated with the business is included in the carrying amount of the business in determining any loss on disposal. Our evaluation of whether the portion of a reporting unit being disposed of constitutes a business occurs on the date of abandonment. Although an operating store meets the accounting definition of a business prior to abandonment, it does not constitute a business on the closure date because the remaining assets on that date do not constitute an integrated set of assets that are capable of being conducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return to investors. As a result, when closing individual stores, we do not include goodwill in the calculation of any loss on disposal of the related assets. As noted above, if store closures are indicative of potential impairment of goodwill at the reporting unit level, we perform an evaluation of our reporting unit goodwill when such closures occur. Stock based Compensation We measure the fair value of stock awards at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize the expense over the related service period. For stock option awards we use the Black Scholes Merton option pricing model which requires the input of subjective assumptions. These assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their stock options before exercising them (expected term), the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the expected dividend yield. In addition, we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those stock awards expected to vest. We estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience. Changes in our assumptions could materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation; however, a 10% change in our critical assumptions including volatility and expected term would not have a material impact for fiscal year 2010. Operating Leases We lease retail stores, roasting and distribution facilities and office space under operating leases. We provide for an estimate of asset retirement obligation (ARO) expense at the lease inception date for operating leases with requirements to remove leasehold improvements at the end of the lease term. Estimating AROs involves subjective assumptions regarding both the amount and timing of actual future retirement costs. Future actual costs could differ significantly from amounts initially estimated. In addition, the large number of operating leases and the significant number of international markets in which we have operating leases adds administrative complexity to the calculation of ARO expense, as well as to the other technical accounting requirements of operating leases such as contingent rent. Estimating the cost of certain lease exit costs involves subjective assumptions, including the time it would take to sublease the leased location and the related potential sublease income. The estimated accruals for these costs could be significantly affected if future experience differs from that used in the initial estimate. 37 Table of Contents Self Insurance Reserves We use a combination of insurance and self insurance mechanisms, including a wholly owned captive insurance entity and participation in a reinsurance treaty, to provide for the potential liabilities for certain risks, including workers compensation, healthcare benefits, general liability, property insurance, and director and officers liability insurance. Liabilities associated with the risks that are retained by Starbucks are not discounted and are estimated, in part, by considering historical claims experience, demographic factors, severity factors and other actuarial assumptions. The estimated accruals for these liabilities could be significantly affected if future occurrences and claims differ from these assumptions and historical trends. Income Taxes We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the respective tax bases of our assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which we expect the temporary differences to reverse. We routinely evaluate the likelihood of realizing the benefit of our deferred tax assets and may record a valuation allowance if, based on all available evidence, we determine that some portion of the tax benefit will not be realized. In addition, our income tax returns are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities. These audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions, including the timing and amount of deductions taken and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions. We evaluate our exposures associated with our various tax filing positions and record a related liability. We adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled, the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position, or when more information becomes available. Deferred tax asset valuation allowances and our liability for unrecognized tax benefits require significant management judgment regarding applicable statutes and their related interpretation, the status of various income tax audits, and our particular facts and circumstances. We believe that our estimates are reasonable; however, actual results could differ from these estimates.
