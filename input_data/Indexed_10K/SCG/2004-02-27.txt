Through its wholly owned regulated subsidiaries, SCANA is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in parts of South Carolina and the purchase, transmission and sale of natural gas in portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. Through a wholly owned nonregulated subsidiary, SCANA markets natural gas to retail customers in Georgia and to wholesale customers primarily in the southeast. Other wholly owned nonregulated subsidiaries hold investments in the securities of certain telecommunications companies, perform power plant management and maintenance services, provide service contracts to homeowners on certain home appliances and heating and air conditioning units, and through a service company, provide administrative, management and other services to other subsidiaries of SCANA Following are percentages of SCANAs revenues and net income earned by regulated and nonregulated subsidiaries and the percentage of total assets held by them. % of Revenues 2003 2002 2001 Regulated 73% 75% 68% Nonregulated 27% 25% 32% % of Net Income (Loss) 2003 2002 (1) 2001(2) Regulated 92% 10% 45% Nonregulated 8% (110%) 55% % of Assets 2003 2002 2001 Regulated 93% 91% 85% Nonregulated 7% 9% 15% (1) In 2002, net income for regulated subsidiaries totaled $13.6 million and net loss for nonregulated subsidiaries totaled $155.3 million. Net income for regulated subsidiaries included an impairment charge related to the acquisition adjustment associated with PSNC Energy ($230 million, net of tax). Net loss for nonregulated subsidiaries included impairment charges for the Companys telecommunications investments ($189.2 million, net of tax), which were partially offset by gains the Company recognized from the sale of a radio service network ($9.4 million, net of tax) and the sale of DTAG shares ($15.3 million, net of tax). See Results of Operations for more information. (2) Net income from nonregulated subsidiaries in 2001 was significantly impacted by gains the Company recognized from the sale of shares of telecommunications investments ($354.4 million, net of tax) and the sale of the assets of a subsidiary ($4.7 million, net of tax). These gains were partially offset by impairment charges related to telecommunications investments, ($35.5 million, net of tax) and other investments ($9.0 million, net of tax). See Results of Operations for more information. Electric Operations The electric operations segment is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, GENCO and Fuel Company, and is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in South Carolina. At December 31, 2003 SCE&G provided electricity to over 570,000 customers in an area of approximately 15,000 square miles. GENCO owns and operates a coal fired generating station and sells electricity solely to SCE&G. Fuel Company acquires, owns and provides financing for SCE&Gs nuclear fuel, fossil fuel and sulfur dioxide emission allowance requirements. Operating results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for electricity, the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers. Embedded in these rates is an allowed regulatory return on equity, which is currently 12.45%. Demand for electricity is primarily affected by weather, customer growth and the economy. In addition, significant legislative and regulatory matters could significantly impact the results of operations and cash flows for the electric operations segment. In South Carolina the state legislature is not actively pursuing electric restructuring. However, both houses of the U.S. Congress passed energy legislation in 2003, with the House of Representatives passing an energy conference report. The Senate failed to pass the conference report due to its inability to reach a compromise on certain key issues unrelated to utilities. If a compromise is reached in 2004, such legislation is expected to contain provisions that would repeal PUHCA and transfer additional regulatory authority to FERC. This legislation may also impose stringent requirements on retail electric suppliers to generate electricity from renewable energy resources, which sources may or may not include hydroelectric generation. In addition, largely in response to the August 2003 blackout in eight northern states and parts of Canada, the energy legislation would likely include provisions to develop and enforce reliability standards for high voltage transmission systems and to expedite construction of transmission lines. The Company cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted, and if it is, the conditions it would impose on utilities. If the energy legislation stalls in 2004, or if it fails to address certain issues, FERC is expected to proceed with regulatory initiatives that would significantly change the countrys existing regulatory framework governing transmission, open access and energy markets and would attempt, in large measure, to standardize the national energy market. In July 2002 FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Standard Market Design (SMD) which FERC supplemented with the issuance of a "white paper" in April 2003. If implemented, the proposed rule could have a significant impact on SCE&Gs access to or cost of power for its native load customers and on SCE&Gs marketing of power outside its service territory. The Company is currently evaluating FERCs action to determine potential effects on SCE&Gs operations. Additional directives from FERC are expected, and would likely be significantly influenced by the energy legislation discussed in the preceding paragraph. The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) is comprised of utilities and other market participants who voluntarily develop and comply with NERC policies and standards which govern the planning and operation of the nations interconnected bulk power system (the Grid). Currently these policies and standards are enforceable only through voluntary compliance by NERC members. Since the August 2003 blackout, and in response to issues identified during investigation of the blackout, NERC has been developing additional reliability standards, policies, and procedures. NERC is working with the regions and utilities in North America to strengthen existing enforcement and compliance programs, and is seeking to develop contracts between the regions and utility members to require compliance with these standards. NERC is also actively pursuing federal legislation to provide it with the authority to enforce reliability standards on all market participants, not just utilities. SCE&G continues to work with NERC and directly with other utilities to develop additional reliability policies and standards and continues to comply with NERCs existing policies and standards. Gas Distribution The gas distribution segment is comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G and PSNC Energy, and is primarily engaged in the purchase, transmission and sale of natural gas in portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. At December 31, 2003 this segment provided natural gas to more than 715,000 customers in an area of approximately 34,000 square miles. Operating results for gas distribution are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas, the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers. Embedded in these rates is an allowed regulatory return on equity, which is currently 12.25% for SCE&G and 11.4% for PSNC Energy. Demand for natural gas is primarily affected by weather, customer growth, the economy and, for commercial and industrial customers, the availability and price of alternate fuels. Natural gas competes with electricity, propane and heating oil to serve the heating and, to a lesser extent, other household energy needs of residential and small commercial customers. This competition is generally based on price and convenience. Large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel, such as propane or fuel oil. Natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price. As a result, any significant disparity between supply and demand, either of natural gas or of alternate fuels, and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors, will affect price and impact the Companys ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers. Gas Transmission The gas transmission segment is comprised of SCPC. SCPC is engaged in the purchase, transmission and sale of natural gas on a wholesale basis to distribution companies (including SCE&G) and directly to industrial customers throughout most of South Carolina. Operating results for gas transmission are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas, the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers. Embedded in these rates is an allowed regulatory return on equity, which for SCPC is currently 12.5% to 16.5%. Demand for natural gas is primarily affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth. SCPC supplies natural gas to SCE&G for its resale to gas distribution customers and for certain electric generation needs. SCPC also sells natural gas to large commercial and industrial customers in South Carolina and faces the same competitive pressures as the gas distribution segment for these classes of customers. Retail Gas Marketing SCANA Energy, a division of SEMI, comprises the retail gas marketing segment. This segment markets natural gas to over 400,000 customers throughout Georgia. SCANA Energys competitors include affiliates of other large energy companies with experience in Georgias energy market as well as several electric membership cooperatives. SCANAs ability to maintain its market share depends on the prices it charges customers relative to the prices charged by its competitors, its ability to continue to provide high levels of customer service and other factors. In addition, the pipeline capacity available for SCANA Energy to serve industrial and other customers is tied to the market share held by SCANA Energy in the retail market. In December 2003 SCANA Energy signed a definitive agreement with another marketer to acquire the approximately 50,000 retail natural gas customers being served by that marketer in Georgia. The purchase, which is subject to customary closing conditions, was approved by the GPSC in January 2004 and is expected to be completed in March 2004. With this transaction, SCANA Energys total customer base will represent about a 30 percent share of the 1.5 million customers in Georgias natural gas market. SCANA Energy remains the second largest natural gas marketer in the state. In 2002 SCANA Energy was selected by the GPSC to serve as Georgias regulated provider for a two year period. In this capacity, SCANA Energy serves low income customers at a rate subsidized by Georgias Universal Service Fund, and extends service to high credit risk customers who have been denied service by other marketers. At December 31, 2003 SCANA Energys regulated division served over 40,000 customers. In 2004 the GPSC may extend SCANA Energys term for an additional year (beginning September 1) or may conduct another bidding process, in which SCANA Energy may participate, to select a regulated provider for a new term. In July 2003 the GPSC approved a joint stipulation between the GPSC staff, Atlanta Gas Light Company (AGL) and natural gas marketers (excluding SCANA Energy). The joint stipulation, among other things, reduces the frequency whereby AGL can recall capacity previously released to the various gas marketers and streamlines certain gas balancing processes. Though SCANA Energy believes the joint stipulation will improve operations for itself and the other gas marketers, SCANA Energy continues to advocate an alternate plan it proposed that would assign interstate asset capacity to those gas marketers choosing assignment and approved by the GPSC. The GPSC filed a request with FERC to obtain a declaratory order on whether FERC regulation would preempt or have jurisdiction over SCANA Energys proposal. Comments were due to FERC by December 26, 2003. It is uncertain how long it will take for FERC to issue an order. However, once an order is issued the GPSC will determine what action, if any, the GPSC should take on SCANA Energys proposal. SCANA Energy and SCANAs other natural gas distribution, transmission and marketing segments maintain gas inventory and also utilize forward contracts and financial instruments, including futures contracts and options, to manage their exposure to fluctuating commodity natural gas prices. (See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.) As a part of this risk management process, at any given time, a portion of SCANAs projected natural gas needs has been purchased or otherwise placed under contract. Since SCANA Energy operates in a competitive market, it may be unable to sustain its current levels of customers and or pricing, thereby reducing expected margins and profitability. Energy Marketing The divisions of SEMI, excluding SCANA Energy, comprise the energy marketing segment. This segment markets natural gas primarily in the southeast and provides energy related risk management services to producers and customers. The operating results for energy marketing are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas and the ability to control costs. Demand for natural gas is primarily affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Companys reported earnings (loss) are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that, in addition to reported earnings (loss) under GAAP, the GAAP adjusted net earnings from operations provides a meaningful representation of the Companys fundamental earnings power and period over period financial performance. A reconciliation of reported (GAAP) earnings (loss) per share to GAAP adjusted net earnings from operations per share is provided in the table below: Earnings (Loss) and Dividends Reported (GAAP) earnings (loss) per share and GAAP adjusted net earnings from operations per share of common stock and cash dividends declared for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: 2003 2002 2001 Reported (GAAP) earnings (loss) per share $2.54 $(1.34) $5.15 Less: Gains from sales of investments and assets .35 .24 3.42 Investment impairments (.31) (1.79) (.42) Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of (2.17) taxes GAAP adjusted net earnings from operations per share $2.50 $2.38 $2.15 Cash dividends declared (per share) $1.38 $1.30 $1.20 o 2003 vs 2002 GAAP adjusted net earnings from operations increased $.12 primarily due to higher electric margins of $.35, higher gas margins of $.25 and improved results from non regulated subsidiaries of $.04. These factors were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses of $.21 (including $.07 due to lower pension income), higher depreciation and amortization expense of $.11, higher property taxes of $.07, lower equity AFC of $.02 and the dilutive effect of additional shares outstanding of $.11. o 2002 vs 2001 GAAP adjusted net earnings from operations increased $.23 primarily due to higher electric margins of $.36, lower interest expense of $.14, improved results from non regulated subsidiaries of $.08, increased allowance for funds used during construction of $.06, lower depreciation and amortization expense of $.02 and other items totaling $.03. These factors were partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses of $.24 (including $.07 due to lower pension income), lower gas margins of $.15 and higher property taxes of $.07. In 2003 the Company recognized a gain of $.35 per share in connection with the sale of ITC Holding and the receipt of an investment interest in a newly formed entity (Magnolia Holding). The Company also recorded impairment charges totaling $.31 per share related to the other than temporary decline in market value of its investment in Knology. In 2002 the Company recorded an impairment charge of $1.72 per share related to the Companys investment in DTAG. In addition, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $.07 per share related to its investment in ITC^DeltaCom. Also, as required by SFAS 142 the Company recorded as the cumulative effect of an accounting change an impairment charge of $2.17 per share related to the acquisition adjustment associated with PSNC Energy (see Note 1G to the consolidated financial statements). In addition, the Company recognized gains of $.09 per share from the sale of the Companys radio service network and $.15 per share in connection with its sale of DTAG shares. In 2001 the Company recognized a gain of $3.38 per share in connection with the exchange of its investment in Powertel, which was acquired by DTAG in May 2001. The Company also recognized a gain of $.04 per share in connection with the sale of the assets of SCANA Security in March 2001. In addition, the Company recorded impairment charges related to investments in ITC^DeltaCom of $.34 per share, a developer of micro turbine technology of $.04 per share and a lime production plant (which was subsequently sold) of $.04 per share. Pension Income Pension income was recorded on the Companys financial statements as follows: Millions of dollars 2003 2002 2001 Income Statement Impact: (Component of) reduction in employee benefit costs $(2.3) $10.9 $22.6 Other income 7.9 11.1 12.7 Balance Sheet Impact: (Component of) reduction in capital expenditures (0.5) 3.1 6.2 Component of (reduction in) amount due to Summer Station co owner (0.1) 0.7 1.8 Total Pension Income $5.0 $25.8 $43.3 For the last several years, the market value of the Companys retirement plan (pension) assets has exceeded the total actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits. However, pension income for 2003 decreased significantly compared to 2002 and 2001, primarily as a result of a less favorable investment market. See also the discussion of pension accounting in Critical Accounting Policies. Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFC) AFC is a utility accounting practice whereby a portion of the cost of both equity and borrowed funds used to finance construction (which is shown on the balance sheet as construction work in progress) is capitalized. The Company includes an equity portion of AFC in nonoperating income and a debt portion of AFC in interest charges (credits) as noncash items, both of which have the effect of increasing reported net income. AFC represented approximately 7.2% of income before income taxes in 2003, 25.8% in 2002 and 3.0% in 2001. The ratio in 2002 was significantly higher than historical norms due to the inclusion in income before income taxes of $291 million of impairments related to the other than temporary decline in market value of the Companys investment in DTAG and ITC^DeltaCom. The ratio in 2001 was lower than historical norms due to the inclusion in income before income taxes of a gain of $545 million on the exchange of the Companys investment in Powertel for shares of DTAG. In addition to the effect of impairments, the decrease in AFC for 2003 vs 2002 is partially due to the completion of the Urquhart Station repowering project in June 2002. Also, in January 2003 the SCPSC issued an order allowing SCE&G to include all Jasper County generating project expenditures as of December 31, 2002 and other construction work in progress expenditures as of June 30, 2002 in electric rate base. At the time the expenditures were included in the rate base, AFC was no longer calculated on those amounts. These decreases were partially offset by increased AFC from subsequent construction expenditures related to the Jasper County generating and Lake Murray Dam projects (see discussion at CAPITAL PROJECTS). In addition to the effect of impairments in 2002 and the gain in 2001, the increase in AFC for 2002 vs 2001 was primarily the result of increased construction expenditures for the Urquhart Station repowering, Jasper County generating and Lake Murray Dam projects. Electric Operations Electric Operations is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, GENCO and Fuel Company. Electric operations sales margins for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: Millions of dollars 2003 % Change 2002 % Change 2001 Operating revenues $1,466.5 6.3% $1,379.5 0.8% $1,368.7 Less: Fuel used in generation 334.1 1.4% 329.6 16.3% 283.3 Purchased power 64.0 52.0% 42.1 (69.5%) 138.1 Margin $1,068.4 6.0% $1,007.8 6.4% $947.3 o 2003 vs 2002 Margin increased primarily due to the increase in retail electric base rates approved in January 2003 totaling $63.6 million and customer growth and increased consumption of $24.3 million, partially offset by $27.3 million due to less favorable weather. Fuel used in generation increased by $9.3 million due to the increased cost of natural gas and fuel oil for the Urquhart combined cycle gas turbines and by $1.1 million due to the increased cost of nuclear fuel, partially offset by $5.5 million due to planned plant outages throughout the year. Purchased Power increased due to planned plant outages throughout the year. o 2002 vs 2001 Margin increased primarily due to more favorable weather of $31.9 million and customer growth and increased consumption of $30.5 million. Fuel used in generation increased and purchased power decreased due to completion of the Urquhart Station repowering project in June 2002 and fewer plant outages during 2002. MWh sales volume by classes, related to the electric margin above, were as follows: Classification (in thousands) 2003 % Change 2002 % Change 2001 Residential 6,998 (3.2%) 7,230 11.3% 6,494 Commercial 6,607 (0.8%) 6,658 5.9% 6,288 Industrial 6,548 0.7% 6,505 2.5% 6,348 Sales for resale (excluding interchange) 1,438 (0.7%) 1,448 30.0% 1,114 Other 500 (6.5%) 535 0.2% 534 Total territorial 22,091 (1.3%) 22,376 7.7% 20,778 NMST 425 (40.0%) 709 (67.0%) 2,150 Total 22,516 (2.5%) 23,085 0.7% 22,928 o 2003 vs 2002 Territorial sales volume decreased primarily due to less favorable weather. NMST volumes decreased primarily due to planned outages at generation plants that reduced volumes available for resale. o 2002 vs 2001 Territorial sales volume increased primarily due to more favorable weather. The decrease in NMST volumes reflects the Companys recording of buy resale transactions in Other Income beginning in the third quarter of 2002. Gas Distribution Gas Distribution is comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G and PSNC Energy. Gas distribution sales margins (including transactions with affiliates) for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: Millions of dollars 2003 % Change 2002 % Change 2001 Operating revenues $869.0 32.9% $653.9 (17.6%) $793.6 Less: Gas purchased for resale 599.3 49.5% 401.0 (25.4%) 537.8 Margin $269.7 6.6% $252.9 (1.1%) $255.8 o 2003 vs 2002 Margin increased primarily due to customer growth and increased consumption totaling $20.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in industrial usage of $4.1 million primarily due to an unfavorable competitive position of natural gas relative to alternate fuels. o 2002 vs 2001 Margin decreased primarily as a result of the slowing economy and increased competition with alternate fuels. DT sales volume by classes, including transportation gas, were as follows: Classification (in thousands) 2003 % Change 2002 % Change 2001 Residential 38,542 8.0% 35,674 11.6% 31,967 Commercial 27,715 11.2% 24,927 5.7% 23,583 Industrial 20,109 (5.4%) 21,247 8.5% 19,578 Transportation gas 25,387 (15.8%) 30,166 7.1% 28,180 Sales for resale 1 1 1 Total 111,754 (0.2%) 112,015 8.4% 103,309 o 2003 vs 2002 Residential and commercial sales volumes increased primarily due to more favorable weather. Industrial and transportation volumes decreased in 2003 primarily as a result of interruptible customers using their alternate fuel sources during the year. o 2002 vs 2001 Residential and commercial sales volumes increased primarily due to more favorable weather. Industrial and transportation volumes increased in 2002 primarily due to the volatility of the natural gas market in 2001, resulting in interruptible customers using their alternate fuel sources during that year. Gas Transmission Gas Transmission is comprised of the operations of SCPC. Gas transmission sales margins (including transactions with affiliates) for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: Millions of dollars 2003 % Change 2002 % Change 2001 Operating revenues $519.8 8.5% $479.1 0.2% $478.0 Less: Gas purchased for resale 472.2 6.7% 442.4 1.9% 434.1 Margin $47.6 29.7% $36.7 (16.4%) $43.9 o 2003 vs 2002 Margin increased primarily due to the favorable competitive position of natural gas relative to alternate fuels in the first quarter of $13.6 million, partially offset by the unfavorable competitive position of natural gas relative to alternate fuels in the second, third and fourth quarters of $1.5 million. o 2002 vs 2001 Margin decreased primarily due to the unfavorable competitive position of natural gas relative to alternate fuels in the first quarter of $9.6 million, partially offset by a favorable competitive position in the remaining quarters of $1.4 million and increased sales for electric generation of $1.0 million. DT sales volume by classes including transportation were as follows: Classification (in thousands)2003 % Change 2002 % Change 2001 Commercial 107 (8.8%) 118 64.6% 71 Industrial 31,436 (32.5%) 46,578 59.7% 29,176 Transportation 12,865 * 3,757 25.8% 2,987 Sales for resale 47,538 (16.5%) 56,906 8.2% 52,606 Total 91,946 (14.4%) 107,359 26.5% 84,840 *Greater than 100% o 2003 vs 2002 Industrial volumes decreased approximately 6.0 million DTs due to decreased electric generation and approximately 8.8 million DTs due to competitiveness with alternate fuels. Transportation volumes increased approximately 9.1 million DTs and sales for resale volumes decreased approximately 9.4 million DTs primarily as a result of new transportation contracts with resale customers in 2003. o 2002 vs 2001 Industrial volumes increased approximately 3.7 million DTs due to increased electric generation and approximately 4.4 million DTs due to the emergence from bankruptcy of a large industrial customer. The remaining increase is primarily due to improved competition with alternate fuels. Sales for resale volumes increased due to more favorable weather. Retail Gas Marketing Retail Gas Marketing is comprised of SCANA Energy, a division of SCANA Energy Marketing, Inc., which operates in Georgias natural gas market. Retail Gas Marketing revenues and net income for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: Millions of dollars 2003 % Change 2002 % Change 2001 Operating revenues $448.3 18.1% $379.5 (16.4%) $453.8 Net income 20.1 40.6% 14.3 * 6.8 *Greater than 100% o 2003 vs 2002 Operating revenues increased primarily as a result of higher average retail prices and increased volumes. Net income increased primarily due to increased margins of $10.8 million, partially offset by increased bad debt expense of $3.2 million, increased interest expense of $0.5 million and higher operating expense of $0.3 million. o 2002 vs 2001 Operating revenues decreased primarily as a result of lower average retail prices and lower volumes. Net income increased primarily due to lower bad debt expense of $8.1 million, lower interest and depreciation expense of $1.6 million and a lower effective tax rate of $0.8 million, partially offset by a decrease in gas margin of $2.1 million and higher operating expenses of $0.9 million. Delivered volumes for 2003, 2002 and 2001 totaled approximately 35.6 million, 33.8 million and 36.0 million DT, respectively. Energy Marketing Energy Marketing is comprised of the Companys non regulated marketing operations, excluding SCANA Energy. Energy Marketing operating revenues and net income (loss) for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: Millions of dollars 2003 % Change 2002 % Change 2001 Operating revenues $415.7 31.2% $316.8 (48.4%) $613.4 Net income (loss) (1.1) (37.5%) (0.8) * 3.4 *Greater than 100% o 2003 vs 2002 Operating revenues increased $98.9 million which reflects a $146.0 million increase due to higher natural gas prices and a $45.9 million decrease due to lower volumes. Net loss increased primarily due to lower margins of $2.5 million partially offset by lower operating expenses of $2.3 million. o 2002 vs 2001 Operating revenues decreased primarily due to lower natural gas prices and lower volumes. Net income decreased $4.2 million which reflects decreases of $5.3 million due to the closing of SCANA Energy Trading, LLC and $1.7 million due to lower margins, partially offset by increases of $1.3 million due to the closing of the unprofitable Midwest office in 2001 and $1.5 million due to lower bad debt expense. Delivered volumes for 2003, 2002 and 2001 totaled approximately 73.6 million, 86.2 million and 114.6 million DT, respectively. Delivered volumes decreased in 2003 compared to 2002 by approximately 2.7 million DT due to decreased industrial usage and by approximately 9.8 million DT due to fewer customers caused by a sluggish economy and related customer credit constraints. Delivered volumes decreased in 2002 compared to 2001 primarily due to the closing of SCANA Energy Trading, LLC and the Midwest office in 2001. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses were as follows: Millions of dollars 2003 % Change 2002 % Change 2001 Other operation and maintenance $558.3 6.9% $522.2 8.6% $480.8 Depreciation and amortization 238.3 8.3% 220.0 (1.7%) 223.8 Other taxes 139.2 9.7% 126.9 10.1% 115.3 Total $935.8 7.7% $869.1 6.0% $819.9 o 2003 vs 2002 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to lower pension income of $13.2 million, increased labor and benefit costs of $8.3 million, increased bad debt expense of $6.5 million, increased nuclear operating expenses of $4.5 million and increased other operating expenses of $3.6 million. Depreciation and amortization increased by $11.4 million due to normal net property additions, by $4.2 million due to the completion of the Urquhart Station repowering project in June 2002 and by $2.7 million due to amortization of franchise fees. Other taxes increased primarily due to increased property taxes. o 2002 vs 2001 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to lower pension income of $11.6 million, increased labor and benefit costs of $19.2 million, increased nuclear refueling maintenance costs of $4.0 million, increased cost at Cogen South of $3.1 million, higher property insurance of $2.6 million, increased amortization of environmental costs of $3.0 million and increased storm damage expenses of $1.8 million. These increases were partially offset by lower bad debt expense of $7.0 million. Depreciation and amortization decreased primarily due to implementation of SFAS 142 and the resulting elimination of amortization expense related to goodwill of $14.0 million see Note 1G to the consolidated financial statements, which was partially offset by increases for the completion of the Urquhart Station repowering project in June 2002 of $4.8 million and normal net property additions of $5.4 million. Other taxes increased primarily due to increased property taxes. Other Income Components of other income, excluding the equity component of AFC, were as follows: Millions of dollars 2003 % Change 2002 % Change 2001 Gain on sale of investments $59.8 * $23.6 (95.7%) $545.3 Gain on sale of assets 1.2 (92.7%) 16.4 33.3% 12.3 Impairment of investments (53.1) (81.7%) (290.7) * (61.9) Other income 47.9 (0.8%) 48.3 21.7% 39.7 Total $55.8 * $(202.4) * $535.4 *Greater than 100% A $59.8 million gain on sale of investments was recognized in 2003 in connection with the sale of ITC Holding and the receipt of an investment interest in a newly formed entity (Magnolia Holding). In 2002 $23.6 million was recognized upon the sale of the Companys DTAG stock. Gain on sale of assets in 2002 included the sale of the Companys radio system to Motorola. Impairments recorded in 2002 included those related to DTAG and ITC^DeltaCom, while impairments in 2003 related solely to the investment in Knology. Interest Expense Components of interest expense, excluding the debt component of AFC, were as follows: Millions of dollars 2003 % Change 2002 % Change 2001 Interest on long term debt, net $205.2 0.1% $205.0 (8.4%) $223.8 Other interest expense 5.8 (4.9%) 6.1 (39.6%) 10.1 Total $211.0 (0.1%) $211.1 (9.8%) $233.9 o 2003 vs 2002 Interest expense remained flat due to an $8.5 million decreas e as a result of lower interest rates (including the effect of swaps) which was partially offset by an $8.3 million increase due to additional borrowings. o 2002 vs 2001 Interest expense decreased by $20.8 million as a result of lower interest rates and by $1.4 million due to lower amortization of debt expense which occurred as a result of debt reduction. Income Taxes Income taxes increased approximately $98.9 million in 2003 compared to 2002 and decreased approximately $268.7 million in 2002 compared to 2001. Changes in income taxes are primarily due to changes in Other Income described above. The Companys effective tax rate for 2003 was approximately 31.7%, which reflects the impact of the change in tax regulations effective in 2002 allowing for the tax deductibility of certain dividends paid on SCANA stock held in the Companys Stock Purchase Savings Plan. The Companys effective tax rate has also been favorably impacted in recent years by the flow through of federal investment tax credits and the recovery of the equity portion of AFC. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash requirements for SCANAs regulated subsidiaries arise primarily from their operational needs, funding their construction programs and payment of dividends to SCANA. The ability of the regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant investment, as well as to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas, will depend on their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms. Regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers. Rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs. As customer growth and inflation occur and these subsidiaries continue their ongoing construction programs, rate increases will be sought. The future financial position and results of operations of the regulated subsidiaries will be affected by their ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief, if requested. The Companys leverage ratio of debt to capital increased significantly in 2000, when SCANA issued $700 million of long term debt in connection with the purchase of PSNC Energy. At December 31, 2003 the leverage ratio was 60%. The Companys goal is to reduce this leverage ratio to between 50% to 52%. If the agencies rating the Companys credit determine that the Company will not be able to achieve sufficient improvement in the leverage ratio, these rating agencies may downgrade the Companys debt. Such a downgrade would adversely affect the interest rate the Company may obtain when issuing debt and would increase the rates applicable to the Companys short term commercial paper programs. In order to bring the leverage ratio in line with rating agency expectations, the Company may apply cash flows from operations, sell equity securities, pay down debt with proceeds from the sale of telecommunications investments, or a combination of the three. In addition, SCE&G anticipates finishing construction on its Jasper County generating station and placing it in commercial operation in mid 2004. Once the plant is complete, SCE&Gs capital expenditure budget is expected to decline significantly. The Companys current estimates of its cash requirements for construction and nuclear fuel expenditures, which are subject to continuing review and adjustment, for 2004 2006 are as follows: Type of Facilities 2004 2005 2006 (Millions of dollars) SCE&G: Electric Plant: Generation $197 $52 $135 Transmission 45 51 42 Distribution 105 113 119 Other 14 13 12 Nuclear Fuel 22 5 31 Gas 23 21 23 Common 58 16 16 Other 2 2 Total SCE&G 466 273 378 PSNC Energy 50 53 53 Other Companies Combined 66 32 44 Total $582 $358 $475 The Companys contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2003 are summarized as follows: Contractual Cash Obligations Less than After December 31, 2003 Total 1year 1 3 years 4 5 years 5 years (Millions of dollars) Long term and short term debt (including interest) $6,411 $626 $1,107 $562 $4,116 Capital leases 2 1 1 Operating leases 71 17 36 18 Purchase obligations 221 78 143 Other commercial commitments 6,776 1,271 1,500 726 3,279 Total $13,481 $1,993 $2,787 $1,306 $7,395 Included in other commercial commitments are estimated obligations under forward contracts for natural gas purchases. Many of these forward contracts include customary "make whole" or default provisions, but are not considered to be "take or pay" contracts. Certain of these contracts relate to regulated businesses; therefore, the effects of such contracts on fuel costs are reflected in electric or gas rates. Also included in other commercial commitments is a 15 year "take and pay" contract for natural gas beginning in the spring of 2004, estimated obligations for coal supply purchases and certain obligations related to the Lake Murray Dam reinforcement project. Included in purchase obligations are customary purchase orders under which the Company has the option to utilize certain vendors without the obligation to do so. The Company may terminate such purchase obligations without penalty. In addition to the contractual cash obligations above, the Company sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan and an unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plan for retirees. The pension plan is adequately funded, with no contributions having been required since 1997. No further contributions are anticipated until after 2008. Cash payments under the health care and life insurance benefit plan were approximately $13 million in 2003, and similar payments are expected in the future. In addition, the Company is party to certain NYMEX futures contracts for which any unfavorable market movements through December 31, 2003 are funded in cash. These derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, and their effects are reflected within other comprehensive income until the anticipated sales transactions occur. The Company also has nuclear fuel obligations that are not listed in the contractual cash obligations above. While no specific monetary amount is specified for nuclear fuel contracts, the Companys two thirds share of expected cost is $22.2 million for the year 2004, a total of $54.6 million for the years 2005 2007, a total of $11.9 million for the years 2008 2009 and a total of $20.0 million for the years 2010 2011. The Company also has a legal obligation associated with the decommissioning and dismantling of Summer Station that is not listed in the contractual cash obligations above. See Note 1 to the Companys consolidated financial statements. The Company anticipates that its contractual cash obligations will be met through internally generated funds and the incurrence of additional short term and long term indebtedness. Sales of additional equity securities may also occur. The Company expects that it has or can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet its projected cash requirements for the foreseeable future. Cash outlays for 2004 (estimated) and 2003 (actual) for certain expenditures are as follows: Millions of dollars 2004 2003 Property additions and construction expenditures, net of AFC $559 $725 Nuclear fuel expenditures 22 25 Investments 23 17 Total $604 $767 Included in cash outlays are the following specific projects: o FERC mandated that SCE&Gs Lake Murray Dam be reinforced to comply with new federal safety standards. Construction for the project and related activities is expected to be complete in 2005 at a cost of approximately $275 million, of which approximately $169 million had been incurred through December 31, 2003. o Construction continues on SCE&Gs 875 MW generation plant in Jasper County, South Carolina. The plant is expected to begin commercial operation in mid 2004 and cost approximately $450 million, of which approximately $425 million had been incurred through December 31, 2003. o SCG Pipeline completed construction of an 18.2 mile pipeline in November 2003 at a cost of approximately $30 million. The pipeline will be used to transport natural gas from Port Wentworth and Elba Island, Georgia, to SCE&Gs new generation plant in Jasper County, South Carolina. o In August 2003 SCPC began construction of the South System Loop. This pipeline will stretch 38.3 miles from SCE&Gs Jasper County generating facility to Yemassee in Hampton County, South Carolina, and will provide a new supply source to SCPCs current system. Completion of the pipeline is expected in the first quarter of 2004 at a cost of approximately $25 million. Financing Limits and Related Matters The Companys issuance of various securities, including long term and short term debt, is subject to customary approval or authorization by state and federal regulatory bodies including state public service commissions and the SEC. The following describes the financing programs currently utilized by the Company. At December 31, 2003 SCANA, SCE&G and PSNC Energy had available the following lines of credit and short term borrowings outstanding: (Millions) SCANA SCE&G PSNC Energy Lines of credit: Committed $100 $400 $125 Uncommitted 113 (1) 78 (1) Short term borrowings outstanding: Commercial paper (270 or fewer days) 140 55 Weighted average interest rate 1.15% 1.17% (1) Includes a $78 million uncommitted line that either SCANA or SCE&G may use. In addition, SCE&G has a three year revolving line of credit totaling $75 million, expiring in 2005, that provides backup liquidity. SCANA Corporation SCANA has in effect a medium term note program for the issuance from time to time of unsecured medium term debt securities. While issuance of these securities requires customary approvals discussed above, the Indenture under which they are issued contains no specific limit on the amount which may be issued. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company SCE&Gs First and Refunding Mortgage Bond Indenture, dated April 1, 1945 (Old Mortgage) and covering substantially all of its properties, prohibits the issuance of additional bonds (Class A Bonds) unless net earnings (as therein defined) for 12 consecutive months out of the 18 months prior to the month of issuance are at least twice the annual interest requirements on all Class A Bonds to be outstanding (Bond Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2003 the Bond Ratio was 5.08. The Old Mortgage allows the issuance of Class A Bonds up to an additional principal amount equal to (i) 70% of unfunded net property additions (which unfunded net property additions totaled approximately $1,279 million at December 31, 2003), (ii) retirements of Class A Bonds (which retirement credits totaled $156.9 million at December 31, 2003), and (iii) cash on deposit with the Trustee. SCE&G is also subject to a bond indenture dated April 1, 1993 (New Mortgage) covering substantially all of its electric properties under which its future mortgage backed debt (New Bonds) will be issued. New Bonds are issued under the New Mortgage on the basis of a like principal amount of Class A Bonds issued under the Old Mortgage which have been deposited with the Trustee of the New Mortgage. At December 31, 2003 approximately $924.6 million Class A Bonds were on deposit with the Trustee of the New Mortgage and are available to support the issuance of additional New Bonds. New Bonds will be issuable under the New Mortgage only if adjusted net earnings (as therein defined) for 12 consecutive months out of the 18 months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least twice the annual interest requirements on all outstanding bonds (including Class A Bonds) and New Bonds to be outstanding (New Bond Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2003 the New Bond Ratio was 4.87. SCE&Gs Restated Articles of Incorporation (the Articles) prohibit issuance of additional shares of preferred stock without the consent of the preferred shareholders unless net earnings (as defined therein) for the 12 consecutive months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least one and one half times the aggregate of all interest charges and preferred stock dividend requirements on all shares of preferred stock outstanding immediately after the proposed issue (Preferred Stock Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2003, the Preferred Stock Ratio was 1.55. The Articles also require the consent of a majority of the total voting power of SCE&Gs preferred stock before SCE&G may issue or assume any unsecured indebtedness if, after such issue or assumption, the total principal amount of all such unsecured indebtedness would exceed ten percent of the aggregate principal amount of all of SCE&Gs secured indebtedness and capital and surplus (the ten percent test). No such consent is required to enter into agreements for payment of principal, interest and premium for securities issued for pollution control purposes. At December 31, 2003 the ten percent test would have limited issuances of unsecured indebtedness to approximately $413.5 million. Unsecured indebtedness at December 31, 2003 totaled approximately $94.4 million, and was comprised of short term borrowings. In 2002 SCE&G entered into an agreement with the South Carolina Transportation Infrastructure Bank (the Bank) and the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) that allows SCE&G to borrow funds from the Bank to construct a roadbed for SCDOT in connection with the Lake Murray Dam remediation project. The loan agreement provides for interest free borrowings for costs incurred not to exceed $59 million, with such borrowings being repaid over ten years from the initial borrowing. At December 31, 2003 SCE&G had not borrowed under the agreement, but expects to fully draw these amounts in 2004. Any such amounts would be included in the ten percent test. Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated PSNC Energy has in effect a medium term note program for the issuance from time to time of unsecured medium term debt securities. While issuance of these securities requires regulatory approval, the Indenture under which they are issued contains no specific limit on the amount which may be issued. Financing Cash Flows During 2003 the Company experienced net cash outflows related to financing activities of approximately $105 million primarily due to the reduction of long and short term debt and payment of dividends. Conversely, SCE&G experienced net cash inflows related to financing activities of approximately $106 million primarily arising from borrowings in support of SCE&Gs construction program and for general corporate purposes. The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk. These swap agreements provide for the Company to pay variable and receive fixed rate interest payments and are designated as fair value hedges of certain debt instruments. The Company may terminate a swap agreement and may replace it with a new swap also designated as a fair value hedge. Payments received upon termination of such swaps are recorded as basis adjustments to long term debt and are amortized as reductions to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. At December 31, 2003 the estimated fair value of the Companys swaps totaled $6.3 million (gain) related to combined notional amounts of $333.1 million. In anticipation of the issuance of debt, the Company may use interest rate lock or similar agreements to manage interest rate risk. Payments received or made upon termination of such agreements are recorded within other deferred debits or credits on the balance sheet and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. In connection with the issuance of First Mortgage Bonds in May 2003, the Company paid approximately $11.9 million upon the termination of a treasury lock agreement. In connection with the issuance of First Mortgage Bonds in December 2003, the Company paid approximately $3.5 million upon the termination of a forward starting interest rate swap. On February 11, 2004 GENCO issued $100 million of senior secured promissory notes maturing February 1, 2024 and bearing a fixed interest rate of 5.49%. Proceeds from this issuance will be used to support GENCOs construction program and to repay intercompany advances borrowed for that purpose. On February 19, 2004 SCANA increased the quarterly cash dividend rate on SCANA common stock to $.365 per share, an increase of 5.8%. The new dividend is payable April 1, 2004 to stockholders of record on March 10, 2004. For additional information on significant financing transactions, see the Consolidated Statements of Capitalization and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements for the Company. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Capital Expenditures In the years 2001 through 2003, the Companys capital expenditures for environmental control totaled approximately $227.5 million. These expenditures were in addition to expenditures included in "Other operation and maintenance" expenses, which were approximately $29.2 million, $29.9 million, and $23.0 million during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. It is not possible to estimate all future costs related to environmental matters, but forecasts for capitalized environmental expenditures for the Company are $41.2 million for 2004 and $207.7 million for the four year period 2005 through 2008. These expenditures are included in the Companys construction program, discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources and include the matters discussed below. Electric Operations The CAA required electric utilities to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx) substantially by the year 2000. The Company remains in compliance with these requirements. In 1998 the EPA required the State of South Carolina, among other states, to modify its state implementation plan (SIP) to address the issue of NOx pollution. The States SIP requires additional emissions reductions in 2004 and beyond. Further, the EPA had indicated that it would finalize regulations by December 2004 for stricter limits on mercury and other pollutants generated by coal fired plants. The EPA has undertaken an aggressive enforcement initiative against the utilities industry, and the DOJ has brought suit against a number of utilities in federal court alleging violations of the CAA. At least two of these suits have either been tried or have had substantive motions decided one favorable to the industry and one not. Neither is binding as precedent on the Company. Prior to the suits, those utilities had received requests for information under Section 114 of the CAA and were issued Notices of Violation. The basis for these suits is the assertion by the EPA that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities over the past 20 or more years constitute "major modifications" which would have required the installation of costly Best Available Control Technology (BACT). SCE&G and GENCO have received and responded to Section 114 requests for information related to Canadys, Wateree and Williams Stations. The regulations under the CAA provide certain exemptions to the definition of "major modifications," including an exemption for routine repair, replacement or maintenance. On October 27, 2003 EPA published a final revised NSR rule in the Federal Register with an effective date of December 26, 2003. The new rule represents an industry favorable departure from certain positions advanced by the federal government in the NSR enforcement initiative. However, on motion of several Northeastern states, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stayed the effect of the final rule. The ultimate application of the final rule to the Company is uncertain. The Company has analyzed each of the activities covered by the EPAs requests and believes each of these activities is covered by the exemption for routine repair, replacement and maintenance under what it believes is a fair reading of both the prior regulation and the contested revised regulation. The regulations also provide an exemption for an increase in emissions resulting from increased hours of operation or production rate and from demand growth. The current state of continued DOJ enforcement actions is the subject of speculation industry wide, but it is possible that the EPA will commence enforcement actions against SCE&G and GENCO, and the EPA has the authority to seek penalties at the rate of up to $27,500 per day for each violation. The EPA also could seek installation of BACT (or equivalent) at the three plants. The Company believes that any enforcement actions relative to the Companys, SCE&Gs or GENCOs compliance with the CAA would be without merit. However, if successful, such actions could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. To comply with current and anticipated state and federal regulations, SCE&G and GENCO expect to incur capital expenditures totaling approximately $204.3 million over the 2004 2008 period to retrofit existing facilities, with increased operation and maintenance costs of approximately $2.3 million per year. To meet compliance requirements for the years 2009 through 2013, the Company anticipates additional capital expenditures totaling approximately $92.7 million. The Clean Water Act, as amended, provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require treatment for wastewater discharges. Under this Act, compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program. Discharge permits have been issued for all, and renewed for nearly all, of SCE&Gs and GENCOs generating units. Concurrent with renewal of these permits, the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program of monitoring and controlling thermal discharges and strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams. The Company is developing compliance plans for these initiatives. Congress is expected to consider further amendments to the Clean Water Act in 2004. Such legislation may include limitations to mixing zones, the implementation of technology based standards for main condenser cooling water including intake and discharge structures and toxicity based standards. These provisions, if passed, could have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company, SCE&G and GENCO. Nuclear Fuel Disposal The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 required that the United States government make available by 1998 a permanent repository for high level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel and imposes a fee of 1.0 mil per KWh of net nuclear generation after April 7, 1983. Payments, which began in 1983, are subject to change and will extend through the operating life of SCE&Gs Summer Station. SCE&G entered into a contract with the DOE in 1983 providing for permanent disposal of its spent nuclear fuel by the DOE. The DOE presently estimates that the permanent storage facility will not be available until 2010. SCE&G has on site spent nuclear fuel storage capability until at least 2018 and expects to be able to expand its storage capacity to accommodate the spent nuclear fuel output for the life of the plant through spent fuel pool reracking, dry cask storage or other technology as it becomes available. The Act also imposes on utilities the primary responsibility for storage of their spent nuclear fuel until the repository is available. On January 28, 2004 SCE&G and Santee Cooper (one third owner of Summer Station) filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims against the DOE for breach of the above contract. The contract known as the Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and or High Level Radioactive Waste (Standard Contract) required the federal government to accept and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste beginning not later than January 31, 1998, in exchange for agreed payments fixed in the Standard Contract at particular amounts. As of the date of filing, the federal government has accepted no spent fuel from Summer Station or any other utility for transport and disposal, and has indicated that it does not anticipate doing so until 2010, at the earliest. As a consequence of the federal governments breach of contract, the plaintiffs have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs. There are two additional causes of action alleged as well damages for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and a takings claim demanding just compensation for the taking of the plaintiffs real property (necessitated by the storage). This lawsuit is one of 48 similar lawsuits brought by nuclear utilities as of January 29, 2004. Gas Distribution The Company maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could require environmental cleanup. As site assessments are initiated, estimates are made of the amount of expenditures, if any, deemed necessary to investigate and clean up each site. These estimates are refined as additional information becomes available; therefore, actual expenditures could differ significantly from the original estimates. Amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and cleanup relate solely to regulated operations and are recorded in deferred debits and amortized with recovery provided through rates. Deferred amounts for SCE&G, net of amounts previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements, totaled $10.9 million and $17.9 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The deferral includes the estimated costs associated with the following matters. o SCE&G owns a decommissioned MGP site in the Calhoun Park area of Charleston, South Carolina. The site is currently being remediated for benzene contamination in the intermediate aquifer on surrounding properties. SCE&G anticipates that the remaining remediation activities will be completed by the end of 2004, with certain monitoring and other activities continuing until 2007. As of December 31, 2003, SCE&G has spent approximately $19.7 million to remediate the Calhoun Park site, and expects to spend an additional $2.2 million. o SCE&G owns three other decommissioned MGP sites in South Carolina which contain residues of by product chemicals. Two of these sites are currently being remediated under work plans approved by DHEC. SCE&G is continuing to investigate the remaining site and is monitoring the nature and extent of residual contamination. In addition, in March 2003 SCE&G signed a consent agreement with DHEC related to a site formerly owned by SCE&G. The site contained residue material that was moved from the Columbia MGP. The removal action for this site has been completed. SCE&G anticipates that major remediation activities for the three owned sites will be completed before 2006. As of December 31, 2003, SCE&G has spent approximately $3.0 million related to these three sites, and expects to spend an additional $5.0 million. In addition, PSNC Energy is responsible for environmental cleanup at five sites in North Carolina on which MGP residuals are present or suspected. PSNC Energy has recorded a liability and associated regulatory asset of approximately $7.0 million, which reflects the estimated remaining liability at December 31, 2003. Amounts incurred and deferred to date that are not currently being recovered through gas rates are approximately $2.2 million. Management believes that all MGP cleanup costs incurred will be recoverable through gas rates. REGULATORY MATTERS Material retail rate proceedings are described in more detail in Note 2 to the Companys consolidated financial statements. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company SCE&G is subject to the jurisdiction of the SCPSC as to retail electric and gas rates, service, accounting, issuance of securities (other than short term borrowings) and other matters. In conjunction with a January 2003 order, the SCPSC allowed SCE&G to include all Jasper County generating station project expenditures as of December 31, 2002 and other construction work in progress expenditures as of June 30, 2002 in electric rate base. Once this generating station is complete, SCE&G may seek to include the remaining project expenditures in its electric rate base. Construction expenditures for the Lake Murray Dam construction project, which totaled approximately $169 million as of December 31, 2003, have not been included in electric rate base. When the Lake Murray project is completed in 2005, SCE&G will determine whether to seek inclusion of such expenditures in electric rate base. Synthetic Fuel Investments SCE&G holds two equity method investments in partnerships involved in converting coal to non conventional fuel, the use of which fuel qualifies for federal income tax credits. The aggregate investment in these partnerships as of December 31, 2003 is approximately $2.5 million, and through December 31, 2003, they have generated and passed through to SCE&G approximately $97.4 million in such tax credits. At December 31, 2003 SCE&G has recorded on its balance sheet $66.6 million net deferred fuel tax benefits, which include partnership losses, net of tax. In addition, Primesouth, Inc., a non regulated subsidiary of SCANA, operates a synthetic fuel facility for a third party and receives management fees, royalties and expense reimbursements related to these services. Primesouth does not benefit from any synfuel tax credits. Under a plan approved by the SCPSC, any tax credits generated and ultimately passed through to SCE&G from synfuel produced and consumed by SCE&G, net of partnership losses and other expenses, have been and will be deferred and will be applied to offset the capital costs of projects required to comply with legislative or regulatory actions. See Note 1B to the consolidated financial statements. The IRS has completed and closed examinations of the Companys consolidated federal income tax returns through its tax year ended in 2000, with the exception of the Companys interest in the synthetic fuel partnership, S. C. Coaltech No. 1 L.P. The IRS has notified the Company that it is in the process of closing this partnership examination with no changes being proposed, and that a formal closing letter is forthcoming. The IRS audit report makes no challenge to the declaration that the synthetic fuel facility was properly placed in service, and takes no issue with evidence submitted demonstrating that the facility produces a qualifying fuel. On October 29, 2003, the IRS issued Announcement 2003 70 stating that it had completed a review of chemical change issues associated with tax credits claimed under IRC Section 29 relating to the production and sale of synthetic fuel. It further stated that it would resume the issuance of private letter rulings (PLRs) concerning synthetic fuel credits consistent with the guidelines regarding chemical change previously set forth in Revenue Procedures 2001 30 and 2001 34 and certain additional requirements related to sampling, testing and recordkeeping procedures, even though the IRS has indicated that the level of chemical change required under that guidance is not sufficient for IRC Section 29 purposes. The IRS also stated in the announcement that it would continue to issue PLRs because it recognized that many taxpayers and their investors have relied on its long standing ruling practice to make investments. In Announcement 2003 46 issued on June 27, 2003, the IRS had questioned the validity of certain test procedures and results that had been presented to it by taxpayers with interests in synfuel operations as evidence that the required significant chemical change had occurred, and had initiated a review of these test procedures and results which was completed as noted in Announcement 2003 70. Separately, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Government Affairs Committee of the United States Senate (Subcommittee) is conducting an investigation of potential abuses of tax credits by producers of synthetic fuel under IRC Section 29. The Subcommittee Chairman, in a memorandum commencing the investigation, has stated that he anticipates the investigation will focus on whether certain synthetic fuel producers are claiming tax credits even though their product is not a qualified synthetic fuel under Section 29 and IRS regulations. The memorandum also states that the investigation will address whether certain corporations are engaging in transactions solely to take advantage of unused Section 29 credits with no other business purpose, and the IRS efforts to curb abuses related to these credits. While the effect of these two developments is not clear, the Company is aware that PLRs have been issued since October 29, 2003. The Company has not had any communication with the Subcommittee staff, and with the imminent conclusion of the IRS audit, the Company continues to believe that all of its synthetic fuel tax credits have been properly claimed. Nuclear License Extension In August 2002 SCE&G filed an application with the NRC for a 20 year license extension for its Summer Station. If approved, the extension would allow the plant to operate into 2042. At December 31, 2003 SCE&G had capitalized approximately $8.0 million related to the application process and expects to capitalize an additional $1.0 million in 2004. SCE&G expects the extension to be granted in mid 2004. Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated PSNC Energy is subject to the jurisdiction of the NCUC as to gas rates, issuance of securities (other than notes with a maturity of two years or less or renewals of notes with a maturity of six years or less), accounting and other matters. As a condition to obtaining the NCUCs approval of SCANAs acquisition of PSNC Energy, PSNC Energy agreed to a moratorium on general rate cases until August 2005. General rate relief can be obtained to recover costs associated with materially adverse governmental actions and force majeure events. The U. S. Congress passed the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (the Act), which directs the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish a pipeline integrity management rule for operations of natural gas transmission pipelines that have moderate to high density population areas within close proximity. The Act requires DOT to set stringent regulations on segments of transmission pipeline where leaks or ruptures could threaten people or property. As a result, PSNC Energy must inspect and assess the physical reliability of the approximately 500 miles of its transmission line that are covered by the Act within the initial ten year deadline established by the Act. Depending on the assessment method used, PSNC Energy will be required to reinspect these same lines every five to seven years after the initial deadline. Total costs for compliance with the Act have not been determined. South Carolina Pipeline Corporation SCPC has 2,000 miles of transmission line that are covered by the Act. Total costs for compliance with the Act have not been determined. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Following are descriptions of the Companys accounting policies which are new or most critical in terms of reporting financial condition or results of operations. Utility Regulation The Companys regulated utilities are subject to the provisions of SFAS 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," which require them to record certain assets and liabilities that defer the recognition of expenses and revenues to future periods as a result of being rate regulated. In the future, as a result of deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment, the Company may no longer meet the criteria for continued application of SFAS 71 and could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the Companys Electric Distribution and Gas Distribution segments in the period the write off would be recorded. It is not expected that cash flows or financial position would be materially affected. See Note 1 of Notes to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the Companys regulatory assets and liabilities, including those associated with the Companys environmental assessment program. The Companys generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market. If market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs, the Company could be required to write down its investment in these assets. The Company cannot predict whether any write downs will be necessary and, if they are, the extent to which they would adversely affect the Companys results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded. As of December 31, 2003 the Companys net investments in fossil/hydro and nuclear generation assets were approximately $2,363 million and $563 million, respectively. Revenue Recognition and Unbilled Revenues Revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers of our utilities and retail gas operations are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual reading of their electric and gas meters, the Company records estimates for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. Such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to each customer since the date of the last reading of their respective meters. Such unbilled revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class, the effects of different rate schedules, changes in weather and, where applicable, the impact of weather normalization provisions of rate structures. The accrual of unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs. As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of $133.9 million and $107.7 million, respectively, compared to total revenues for 2003 and 2002 of $3.42 billion and $2.95 billion, respectively. Provisions for Bad Debts and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts As of each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and records allowances for doubtful accounts based on estimates of the level of expected write offs. These estimates are based on, among other things, comparisons of the relative age of accounts, assigned credit ratings for commercial and industrial accounts, and consideration of actual write off history. The distribution segments of the Companys regulated utilities have established write off histories and regulated service areas that enable the utilities to reliably estimate their respective provisions for bad debts. The Companys Retail Gas Marketing segment operates in Georgias natural gas market. As such, estimation of the provision for bad debts related to this segment is subject to greater imprecision. Nuclear Decommissioning Accounting for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future. Among the factors that could change SCE&Gs accounting estimates related to decommissioning costs are changes in technology, changes in regulatory and environmental remediation requirements, and changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and timing of cash flows. SCE&G expects to receive a 20 year license extension for Summer Station that will significantly impact the eventual cost of and funding for decommissioning. See also the discussion of the Companys adoption of SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," below. Changes in any of these estimates could significantly impact the Companys financial position and cash flows (although changes in such estimates should be earnings neutral, because these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers). SCE&Gs share of estimated site specific nuclear decommissioning costs for Summer Station, including the cost of decommissioning plant components not subject to radioactive contamination, totals approximately $357 million, stated in 1999 dollars, based on a decommissioning study completed in 2000. Santee Cooper is responsible for decommissioning costs related to its one third ownership interest in the station. The cost estimate is based on a decommissioning methodology acceptable to the NRC under which the site would be maintained over a period of approximately 60 years in such a manner as to allow for subsequent decontamination that permits release for unrestricted use. Under SCE&Gs method of funding decommissioning costs, funds collected through rates are used to pay premiums on insurance policies on the lives of certain Company personnel. SCE&G is the beneficiary of these policies. Through these insurance contracts, SCE&G is able to take advantage of income tax benefits and accrue earnings on the fund on a tax deferred basis. Amounts for decommissioning collected through electric rates, insurance proceeds, and interest on proceeds, less expenses, are transferred by SCE&G to an external trust fund. Management intends for the fund, including earnings thereon, to provide for all eventual decommissioning expenditures on an after tax basis. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits SCANA follows SFAS 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," in accounting for its defined benefit pension plan. SCANAs plan is fully funded and as such, net pension income is reflected in the financial statements (see Results of Operations). SFAS 87 requires the use of several assumptions, the selection of which may have a large impact on the resulting benefit recorded. Among the more sensitive assumptions are those surrounding discount rates and returns on assets. Net pension income of $5.0 million recorded in 2003 reflects the use of a 6.5% discount rate and an assumed 9.25% long term return on plan assets. SCANA believes that these assumptions were, and that the resulting pension income amount was, reasonable. For purposes of comparison, using a discount rate of 6.0% in 2003 would have lowered SCANAs pension income by approximately $1.9 million. Had the assumed long term return on assets been reduced to 9.0% in 2003, SCANAs pension income would have been reduced by approximately $1.6 million. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Company considers the market indices of high quality long term fixed income securities. As such, the Company selected the beginning of year discount rate of 6.5% as being within a reasonable range of interest rates for obligations rated Aa by Moodys as of January 1, 2003. This same discount rate was also selected for determination of other postemployment benefits (OPEB) costs discussed below. The following information with respect to pension assets (and returns thereon) should also be noted: The Company determines the fair value of substantially all of its pension assets utilizing market quotes rather than utilizing any calculated values, "market related" values or other modeling techniques. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumptions, the Company evaluated input from actuaries and from pension fund investment advisors, including such advisors review of the plans historical 10, 16 and 25 year cumulative actual returns of 10.8%, 12.0% and 12.7%, respectively, all of which have all been in excess of related broad indices. The Company anticipates that investment managers will continue to generate long term returns of at least 9.25%. The expected long term rate of return of 9.25% is based on a target asset allocation of 70% with equity managers and 30% with fixed income managers. Management regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the portfolio to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate. While investment performance in 2000 2002 and the recent decline in discount rate have significantly reduced the level of pension income, the pension trust has been and remains adequately funded, and no contributions have been required since 1997. As such, recent declines in pension income have had no impact on the Companys cash flows. Based on stress testing performed by the Companys actuaries, management does not anticipate the need to make pension contributions until after 2008. Similar to its pension accounting, SCANA follows SFAS 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," in accounting for its postretirement medical and life insurance benefits. This plan is unfunded, so no assumptions related to return on assets impact the net expense recorded; however, the selection of discount rates can significantly impact the actuarial determination of net expense. SCANA used a discount rate of 6.5% and recorded a net SFAS 106 cost of $17.3 million for 2003. Had the selected discount rate been 6.0%, the expense for 2003 would have been approximately $0.5 million higher. Goodwill In connection with the adoption, effective January 1, 2002, of SFAS 142, "Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets," the Company performed a valuation analysis of its investment in SCPC (the Companys Gas Transmission segment) using a discounted cash flow analysis and of PSNC Energy (part of the Companys Gas Distribution segment) using an independent appraisal. The analysis for SCPC indicated that the fair value of related goodwill exceeded its carrying amount. The independent appraisal made various assumptions related to PSNC Energys cash flow projections, discount rates, weighted average cost of capital and market multiples for comparable companies. The analysis indicated that the carrying amount of PSNC Energys acquisition adjustment (goodwill) exceeded its fair value, and as a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $230 million as the cumulative effect of an accounting change, effective January 1, 2002. Subsequent annual calculations required by SFAS 142 have indicated no need for further write downs. Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143 provides guidance for recording and disclosing liabilities related to the future obligations to retire assets (ARO). SFAS 143 applies to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of long lived tangible assets that result from their acquisition, construction, development and normal operation. Because such obligation relates solely to the Companys regulated electric utility, adoption of SFAS 143 had no impact on results of operations; however, as of January 1, 2003, the Company recorded an ARO of approximately $111 million, which exceeded the previously recorded reserve for nuclear plant decommissioning of approximately $87 million. At December 31, 2003 such ARO totaled approximately $118 million. The Company believes that there is legal uncertainty as to the existence of environmental obligations associated with certain transmission and distribution properties. The Company believes that any ARO related to this type of property would be insignificant and, due to the indeterminate life of the related assets, an ARO could not be reasonably estimated. OTHER MATTERS Unconsolidated Special Purpose Entities Although SCANA invests in securities and business ventures, it does not hold investments in unconsolidated special purpose entities such as those described in SFAS 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities," or as described in Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." SCANA does not engage in off balance sheet financing or similar transactions other than incidental operating leases in the normal course of business, generally for office space, furniture and equipment. Claims and Litigation For a description of claims and litigation see Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS and the consolidated financial statements for the Company (Note 10), SCE&G (Note 10) and PSNC Energy (Note 8). Telecommunications Investments The Companys basis in telecommunications investments at December 31, 2003 totaled $47.0 million for equity securities and $62.5 million for debt securities. For a description of such investments, see Note 9 to the Companys consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All financial instruments held by the Company described below are held for purposes other than trading. Interest rate risk The tables below provide information about long term debt issued by the Company and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the figures shown reflect notional amounts and related maturities. Fair values for debt and swaps represent quoted market prices.

At December 31, 2003 the Company held investments in the 13% senior unsecured notes (due 2009) of a telecommunications company, the cost basis of which, including accrued interest, is approximately $49.5 million. As these notes are not actively traded, determination of their fair value is not practicable. Commodity price risk The following tables provide information about the Companys financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in natural gas prices. Weighted average settlement prices are per 10,000 mmbtu. Fair values represent quoted market prices. As of December 31, 2003 Millions of dollars, except weighted average settlement price and strike price Natural Gas Derivatives: Expected Maturity in 2004 Expected Maturity in 2005 Expected Maturity in 2006 Settlement Contract Fair Settlement Contract Fair Settlement Contract Fair Price (a) Amount Value Price (a) Amount Value Price (a) Amount Value Futures Contracts: Long($) 5.74 41.6 46.9 5.05 3.5 4.0 5.12 0.5 0.6 Short($) 6.09 0.7 0.7 Strike Contract Price Amount (a) Options: Purchased call (long)($) 5.55 43.4 As of December 31, 2002 Millions of dollars, except weighted average settlement price and strike price Natural Gas Derivatives: Expected Maturity in 2003 Settlement Contract Fair Price (a) Amount Value Futures Contracts: Long($) 4.65 15.6 18.7 Short($) 4.62 3.6 4.5 Strike Contract Price Amount (a) Options: Purchased put (short)($) 4.25 8.8 Purchased call (long)($) 4.11 16.5 Sold put (long) ($) 2.30 2.7 (a) weighted average The Company uses derivative instruments to hedge forward purchases and sales of natural gas, which create market risks of different types. See Note 9 of the Companys consolidated financial statements. The NYMEX futures information above includes those financial positions of Energy Marketing, SCPC and PSNC Energy. Certain derivatives that SCPC utilizes to hedge its gas purchasing activities are recoverable through its weighted average cost of gas calculation. SCPCs tariffs include a purchased gas adjustment (PGA) clause that provides for the recovery of actual gas costs incurred. The SCPSC has ruled that the results of SCPCs hedging activities are to be included in the PGA and, as such, are subject to the SCPSCs annual prudency review. The offset to the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded as a current asset or liability. Beginning in January 2003, PSNC Energy initiated a hedging program for gas purchasing activities using NYMEX futures and options. PSNC Energys tariffs include a provision for the recovery of actual gas costs incurred. PSNC Energy records transaction fees and any realized gains or losses from derivatives acquired as part of its hedging program in deferred accounts as a regulatory asset or liability for the over or under recovery of gas costs. In an October 2003 order, in connection with PSNC Energys 2003 annual prudency review, the NCUC determined that PSNC Energys gas costs, including all hedging transactions, were reasonable and prudently incurred during the 12 month review period ended March 31, 2003. Equity price risk Investments in telecommunications companies equity securities (excluding preferred stock with significant debt characteristics) are carried at market value or, if market value is not readily determinable, at cost. The carrying value of the Companys investments in such securities totaled $50.2 million at December 31, 2003. A temporary decline in value of ten percent would result in a $5.0 million reduction in fair value and a corresponding adjustment, net of tax effect, to the related equity account for unrealized gains/losses, a component of Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). An other than temporary decline in value of ten percent would result in a $5.0 million reduction in fair value and a corresponding adjustment to net income, net of tax effect. The investment in preferred stock with significant debt characteristics is carried at cost of $13.0 million at December 31, 2003. A temporary decline in value of ten percent would result in a $1.3 million reduction in fair value and a corresponding adjustment, net of tax effect, to the related equity account for unrealized gains/losses, a component of Other Comprehensive Income (Loss). An other than temporary decline in value of ten percent would result in a $1.3 million reduction in fair value and a corresponding adjustment to net income, net of tax effect. 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Statements included in this discussion and analysis (or elsewhere in this annual report) which are not statements of historical fact are intended to be, and are hereby identified as, "forward looking statements" for purposes of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Readers are cautioned that any such forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve a number of risks and uncertainties, and that actual results could differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following: (1) that the information is of a preliminary nature and may be subject to further and or continuing review and adjustment, (2) changes in the utility regulatory environment, (3) changes in the economy, especially in SCE&Gs service territory, (4) the impact of competition from other energy suppliers, including competition from alternate fuels in industrial interruptible markets, (5) growth opportunities, (6) the results of financing efforts, (7) changes in SCE&Gs accounting policies, (8) weather conditions, especially in areas served by SCE&G, (9) performance of SCANA Corporations pension plan assets and the impact on SCE&Gs results of operations, (10) inflation, (11) changes in environmental regulations and (12) the other risks and uncertainties described from time to time in SCE&Gs periodic reports filed with the SEC. SCE&G disclaims any obligation to update any forward looking statements. OVERVIEW SCE&G is a regulated public utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and in the purchase and sale, primarily at retail, of natural gas. SCE&Gs business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Generally, sales of electricity are higher during the summer and winter months because of air conditioning and heating requirements, and sales of natural gas are greater in the winter months due to heating requirements. SCE&Gs electric service area extends into 24 counties covering more than 15,000 square miles in the central, southern and southwestern portions of South Carolina. The service area for natural gas encompasses all or part of 34 of the 46 counties in South Carolina and covers more than 22,000 square miles. Electric Operations The electric operations segment is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G and Fuel Company, and is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in South Carolina. At December 31, 2003 SCE&G provided electricity to over 570,000 customers. Fuel Company acquires, owns and provides financing for SCE&Gs nuclear fuel, fossil fuel and sulfur dioxide emission allowance requirements and is consolidated with SCE&G for financial reporting purposes. Operating results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for electricity, the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers. Embedded in these rates is an allowed regulatory return on equity, which is currently 12.45%. Demand for electricity is primarily affected by weather, customer growth and the economy. In addition, significant legislative and regulatory matters could significantly impact the results of operations and cash flows for the electric operations segment. In South Carolina the state legislature is not actively pursuing electric restructuring. However, both houses of the U.S. Congress passed energy legislation in 2003, with the House of Representatives passing an energy conference report. The Senate failed to pass the conference report due to its inability to reach a compromise on certain key issues unrelated to utilities. If a compromise is reached in 2004, such legislation is expected to contain provisions that would repeal PUHCA and transfer additional regulatory authority to FERC. This legislation may also impose stringent requirements on retail electric suppliers to generate electricity from renewable energy resources, which sources may or may not include hydroelectric generation. In addition, largely in response to the August 2003 blackout in eight northern states and parts of Canada, the energy legislation would likely include provisions to develop and enforce reliability standards for high voltage transmission systems and to expedite construction of transmission lines. SCE&G cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted, and if it is, the conditions it would impose on utilities. If the energy legislation stalls in 2004, or if it fails to address certain issues, FERC is expected to proceed with regulatory initiatives that would significantly change the countrys existing regulatory framework governing transmission, open access and energy markets and would attempt, in large measure, to standardize the national energy market. In July 2002 FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Standard Market Design (SMD) which FERC supplemented with the issuance of a "white paper" in April 2003. If implemented, the proposed rule could have a significant impact on SCE&Gs access to or cost of power for its native load customers and on SCE&Gs marketing of power outside its service territory. SCE&G is currently evaluating FERCs action to determine potential effects on SCE&Gs operations. Additional directives from FERC are expected, and would likely be significantly influenced by the energy legislation discussed in the preceding paragraph. The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) is comprised of utilities and other market participants who voluntarily develop and comply with NERC policies and standards which govern the planning and operation of the nations interconnected bulk power system (the Grid). Currently these policies and standards are enforceable only through voluntary compliance by NERC members. Since the August 2003 blackout, and in response to issues identified during investigation of the blackout, NERC has been developing additional reliability standards, policies, and procedures. NERC is working with the regions and utilities in North America to strengthen existing enforcement and compliance programs, and is seeking to develop contracts between the regions and utility members to require compliance with these standards. NERC is also actively pursuing federal legislation to provide it with the authority to enforce reliability standards on all market participants, not just utilities. SCE&G continues to work with NERC and directly with other utilities to develop additional reliability policies and standards and continues to comply with NERCs existing policies and standards. Gas Distribution The gas distribution segment is comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G and is primarily engaged in the purchase and sale, primarily at retail, of natural gas in portions of South Carolina. At December 31, 2003 this segment provided natural gas to more than 276,000 customers. Operating results for gas distribution are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas, the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers. Embedded in these rates is an allowed regulatory return on equity, which is currently 12.25%. Demand for natural gas is primarily affected by weather, customer growth, the economy and, for commercial and industrial customers, the availability and price of alternate fuels. Natural gas competes with electricity, propane and heating oil to serve the heating and, to a lesser extent, other household energy needs of residential and small commercial customers. This competition is generally based on price and convenience. Large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel, such as propane or fuel oil. Natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price. As a result, any significant disparity between supply and demand, either of natural gas or of alternate fuels, and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors, will affect price and impact SCE&Gs ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Income Net income and the percent change from the previous year for the years 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: Millions of dollars 2003 2002 2001 Net income $220.5 $219.6 $221.9 Percent increase (decrease) in net income 0.41% (12.50%) (1.04%) o 2003 vs 2002 Net income increased slightly primarily due to higher electric margins of $36.8 million, higher gas margins of $2.6 million, reduction of preferred dividend requirements of $0.9 million and other of $1.3 million, partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses of $15.9 million (including $7.1 due to lower pension income), higher depreciation and amortization expense of $10.9 million, higher property taxes of $7.2 million and higher interest expense of $6.7 million. o 2002 vs 2001 Net income decreased primarily due to higher operations and maintenance expenses of $30.4 million (including $6.3 million due to lower pension income), higher property taxes of $6.5 million, and higher interest expense of $4.7 million, partially offset by higher electric margins of $37.3 million. Pension Income Pension income was recorded on SCE&Gs financial statements as follows: Millions of dollars 2003 2002 2001 Income Statement Impact: (Component of) reduction in employee benefit costs $(1.0) $10.5 $20.7 Other income 8.2 11.2 12.7 Balance Sheet Impact: (Component of) reduction in capital expenditures (0.3) 3.1 5.9 Component of (reduction in) amount due to Summer Station co owner (0.1) 0.7 1.8 Total Pension Income $6.8 $25.5 $41.1 For the last several years, the market value of SCE&Gs retirement plan (pension) assets has exceeded the total actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits. However, pension income for 2003 decreased significantly compared to 2002 and 2001, primarily as a result of a less favorable investment market. See also the discussion of pension accounting in Critical Accounting Policies. Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFC) AFC is a utility accounting practice whereby a portion of the cost of both equity and borrowed funds used to finance construction (which is shown on the balance sheet as construction work in progress) is capitalized. An equity portion of AFC is included in nonoperating income and a debt portion of AFC is included in interest charges (credits) as noncash items, both of which have the effect of increasing reported net income. AFC represented approximately 7.8% of income before income taxes in 2003, 9.3% in 2002 and 6.5% in 2001. The decrease in AFC for 2003 vs 2002 is primarily the result of the completion of the Urquhart Station repowering project in June 2002. In addition, in January 2003 the SCPSC issued an order allowing SCE&G to include all Jasper County generating project expenditures as of December 31, 2002 and other construction work in progress expenditures as of June 30, 2002 in its electric rate base. At the time the expenditures were included in the rate base, AFC was no longer calculated on those amounts. These decreases were partially offset by increased AFC from subsequent construction expenditures related to the Jasper County generating and Lake Murray Dam projects (see discussion at CAPITAL PROJECTS). The increase in AFC for 2002 vs 2001 was primarily the result of increased construction expenditures for the Urquhart Station repowering, Jasper County generating and Lake Murray Dam projects. Dividends Declared SCE&Gs Board of Directors has declared the following dividends on common stock held by SCANA during 2003: Declaration Date Dividend Amount Quarter Ended Payment Date February 20, 2003 $35.3 million March 31, 2003 April 1, 2003 May 1, 2003 $36.5 million June 30, 2003 July 1, 2003 July 31, 2003 $37.0 million September 30, 2003 October 1, 2003 November 7, 2003 $36.0 million December 31, 2003 January 1, 2004 Electric Operations Electric Operations is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G and Fuel Company. Electric operations sales margins for 2003, 2002 and 2001, were as follows: Millions of dollars 2003 % Change 2002 % Change 2001 Operating revenues $1,471.7 6.3% $1,384.8 0.8% $1,374.0 Less: Fuel used in generation 272.5 5.8% 257.5 15.0% 223.9 Purchased power 164.0 8.2% 151.6 35.2% 233.9 Margin $1,035.2 6.1% $975.7 6.5% $916.2 o 2003 vs 2002 Margins increased primarily due to the increase in retail electric base rates approved in January 2003 totaling $63.6 million and customer growth and increased consumption of $23.2 million, partially offset by $27.3 million due to less favorable weather. Fuel used in generation increased by $9.3 million due to the increased cost of natural gas and fuel oil for the Urquhart combined cycle gas turbines and by $1.1 million due to the increased cost of nuclear fuel, partially offset by $5.5 million due to planned plant outages throughout the year. Purchased power increased due to planned plant outages throughout the year. o 2002 vs 2001 Margins increased primarily due to more favorable weather of $31.9 million and customer growth and increased consumption of $30.5 million. Fuel used in generation increased and purchased power decreased due to completion of the Urquhart Station repowering project in June 2002 and fewer plant outages during 2002. MWh sales volume by classes, related to the electric margin above, were as follows: % % Classification (in thousands) 2003 Change 2002 Change 2001 Residential 6,998 (3.2%) 7,230 11.3% 6,494 Commercial 6,622 (0.5%) 6,658 5.9% 6,288 Industrial 6,548 0.7% 6,505 2.5% 6,348 Sale for resale (excluding interchange) 1,438 (0.7%) 1,448 30.0% 1,114 Other 500 (6.5%) 535 0.2% 534 Total territorial 22,106 (1.2%) 22,376 7.7% 20,778 NMST 425 (40.0%) 709 (67.0%) 2,150 Total 22,531 (2.4%) 23,085 0.7% 22,928 o 2003 vs 2002 Territorial sales volume decreased primarily due to less favorable weather. NMST volumes decreased primarily due to planned outages at generation plants that reduced volumes available for resale. o 2002 vs 2001 Territorial sales volume increased primarily due to more favorable weather. The decrease in NMST volumes reflects SCE&Gs recording of buy resale transactions in Other Income (rather than in margin) beginning in the third quarter 2002. Gas Distribution Gas Distribution is comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G. Gas distribution sales margins (including transactions with affiliates) for 2003, 2002 and 2001 were as follows: Millions of dollars 2003 % Change 2002 % Change 2001 Operating revenues $360.1 20.8% $298.2 (12.6%) $341.0 Less: Gas purchased for resale 268.8 27.3% 211.1 (16.1%) 251.6 Margin $91.3 4.8% $87.1 (2.6%) $89.4 o 2003 vs 2002 Margin increased primarily due to customer growth and increased consumption totaling $7.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in industrial usage of $3.0 million primarily due to an unfavorable competitive position of natural gas relative to alternate fuels. o 2002 vs 2001 Margin decreased primarily as a result of the slowing economy and increased competition with alternate fuels. DT sales volume by classes, including transportation gas were as follows: Classification (in thousands) % % 2003 Change 2002 Change 2001 Residential 13,243 8.2% 12,242 8.8% 11,257 Commercial 12,322 5.2% 11,718 3.7% 11,305 Industrial 14,374 (9.8%) 15,939 11.4% 14,301 Transportation gas 2,141 (9.8%) 2,373 (3.6%) 2,461 Total 42,080 (0.5%) 42,272 7.5% 39,324 o 2003 vs 2002 Residential and commercial sales volumes increased primarily due to more favorable weather. Industrial and transportation volumes decreased in 2003 primarily as a result of interruptible customers using their alternate fuel sources during the year. o 2002 vs 2001 Residential and commercial sales volumes increased primarily due to more favorable weather. Industrial volumes increased in 2002 primarily due to the volatility of the natural gas market in 2001, resulting in interruptible customers using their alternate fuel sources during that year. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses were as follows: Millions of dollars 2003 % Change 2002 % Change 2001 Other operation and maintenance $392.4 7.0% $366.6 16.1% $315.7 Depreciation and amortization 188.1 10.3% 170.5 4.4% 163.4 Other taxes 120.6 10.7% 108.9 10.1% 98.9 Total $701.1 8.5% $646.0 11.8% $578.0 o 2003 vs 2002 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to lower pension income of $11.5 million, increased labor and benefit costs of $9.8 million, and increased nuclear operating expenses of $4.5 million. Depreciation and amortization increased by $10.7 million due to normal net property increases, by $4.2 million due to the completion of the Urquhart Station repowering project in June 2002 and by $2.7 million due to amortization of franchise fees. Other taxes increased primarily due to increased property taxes. o 2002 vs 2001 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to lower pension income of $10.2 million, increased labor and benefit costs of $19.3 million, increased nuclear refueling maintenance costs of $4.0 million, increased cost at Cogen South of $3.1 million, higher property insurance of $2.6 million, increased amortization of environmental costs of $3.0 million and increased storm damage expenses of $1.8 million. Depreciation and amortization increased by $4.8 million due to completion of the Urquhart Station repowering project in June 2002 and by $2.2 million due to normal net property additions. Other taxes increased primarily due to increased property taxes. Interest Expense Components of interest expense, excluding the debt component of AFC, were as follows: Millions of dollars 2003 % Change 2002 % Change 2001 Interest on long term debt, net $134.3 10.1% $122.0 8.1% $112.9 Other interest expense 5.3 (20.9%) 6.7 17.5% 5.7 Total $139.6 8.5% $128.7 8.5% $118.6 o 2003 vs 2002 Interest expense increased by $10.9 million, primarily due to a $22.0 million increase from additional borrowings, which was partially offset by $10.2 million as a result of lower interest rates. o 2002 vs 2001 Interest expense increased by $11.9 million as a result of increased borrowings which was partially offset by $2.8 million as a result of lower interest rates. Income Taxes Income taxes decreased approximately $5.2 million for the year 2003 compared to 2002 and decreased approximately $10.1 million for the year ended 2002 compared to 2001. Changes in income taxes are primarily due to changes in operating income. SCE&Gs effective tax rate has also been favorably impacted in recent years by the flow through of federal investment tax credits and the recovery of the equity portion of AFC. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES SCE&Gs cash requirements arise primarily from its operational needs, funding its construction program and payment of dividends to SCANA. The ability of SCE&G to replace existing plant investment, as well as to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas, will depend upon its ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms. SCE&G recovers the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers. Rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs. As customer growth and inflation occur and SCE&G continues its ongoing construction program, SCE&G expects to seek increases in rates. SCE&Gs future financial position and results of operations will be affected by its ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief, if requested. SCE&Gs current estimates of its cash requirements for construction and nuclear fuel expenditures, which are subject to continuing review and adjustment, for 2004 2006 are as follows: Type of Facilities 2004 2005 2006 (Millions of dollars) SCE&G: Electric Plant: Generation $197 $52 $135 Transmission 45 51 42 Distribution 105 113 119 Other 14 13 12 Nuclear Fuel 22 5 31 Gas 23 21 23 Common 58 16 16 Other 2 2 Total SCE&G $466 $273 $378 SCE&Gs contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2003 are summarized as follows: Contractual Cash Obligations Less than More than December 31, 2003 Total 1year 1 3 years 4 5 years 5 years (Millions of dollars) Long term and short term debt (including interest) $4,386 $377 $649 $310 $3,050 Purchase obligations 157 40 117 Operating leases 62 13 32 17 Other commercial commitments 523 257 250 6 10 Total $5,128 $687 $1,048 $333 $3,060 Included in other commercial commitments are estimated obligations for coal supply purchases. Actual purchases are included in fuel used in electric generation and recovered through electric rates. Also included in other commercial commitments are obligations for the Lake Murray Dam reinforcement project. See Note 10 to SCE&Gs consolidated financial statements. Included in purchase obligations are customary purchase orders under which SCE&G has the option to utilize certain vendors without the obligation to do so. SCE&G may terminate such purchase obligations without penalty. SCE&G also has nuclear fuel obligations that are not listed in the contractual cash obligations above. While no specific monetary amount is specified for nuclear fuel contracts, SCE&Gs two thirds share of expected cost is $22.2 million for the year 2004, a total of $54.6 million for the years 2005 2007, a total of $11.9 million for the years 2008 2009 and a total of $20.0 million for the years 2010 2011. The Company also has a legal obligation associated with the decommissioning and dismantling of Summer Station that is not listed in the contractual cash obligations above. See Note 1 to the Companys consolidated financial statements. SCE&G anticipates that its contractual cash obligations will be met through internally generated funds and the incurrence of additional short term and long term indebtedness. SCE&G expects that it has or can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet its projected cash requirements for the foreseeable future. Cash outlays for 2004 (estimated) and 2003 (actual) for certain expenditures are as follows: Millions of dollars 2004 2003 Property additions and construction expenditures, net of AFC $443 $565 Nuclear fuel expenditures 22 25 Investments 18 16 Total $483 $606 Included in cash outlays are the following specific projects: o FERC mandated that SCE&Gs Lake Murray Dam be reinforced to comply with new federal safety standards. Construction for the project and related activities is expected to be complete in 2005 at a cost of approximately $275 million, of which approximately $169 million had been incurred through December 31, 2003. o Construction continues on SCE&Gs 875 MW generation plant in Jasper County, South Carolina. The plant is expected to begin commercial operation in mid 2004 and cost approximately $450 million, of which approximately $425 million had been incurred through December 31, 2003. Financing Limits and Related Matters SCE&Gs issuance of various securities, including long term and short term debt, is subject to customary approval or authorization by state and federal regulatory bodies including the SCPSC and the SEC. The following describes the financing programs currently utilized by SCE&G. At December 31, 2003 SCE&G had available the following lines of credit and short term borrowings outstanding: (Millions) Lines of credit: SCE&G Committed $400 Uncommitted (1) $78 Short term borrowings outstanding: Commercial paper (270 or fewer days) $140 Weighted average interest rate 1.15% (1) Comprised of a $78 million uncommitted line that either SCE&G or the Company may use. In addition, SCE&G has a three year revolving line of credit totaling $75 million, expiring in 2005, that provides backup liquidity. SCE&Gs First and Refunding Mortgage Bond Indenture, dated April 1, 1945 (Old Mortgage) and covering substantially all of its properties, prohibits the issuance of additional bonds (Class A Bonds) unless net earnings (as therein defined) for 12 consecutive months out of the 18 months prior to the month of issuance are at least twice the annual interest requirements on all Class A Bonds to be outstanding (Bond Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2003 the Bond Ratio was 5.08. The Old Mortgage allows the issuance of Class A Bonds up to an additional principal amount equal to (i) 70% of unfunded net property additions (which unfunded net property additions totaled approximately $1,279 million at December 31, 2003), (ii) retirements of Class A Bonds (which retirement credits totaled $156.9 million at December 31, 2003), and (iii) cash on deposit with the Trustee. SCE&G is also subject to a bond indenture dated April 1, 1993 (New Mortgage) covering substantially all of its electric properties under which its future mortgage backed debt (New Bonds) will be issued. New Bonds are issued under the New Mortgage on the basis of a like principal amount of Class A Bonds issued under the Old Mortgage which have been deposited with the Trustee of the New Mortgage. At December 31, 2003 approximately $924.6 million Class A Bonds were on deposit with the Trustee of the New Mortgage and are available to support the issuance of additional New Bonds. New Bonds will be issuable under the New Mortgage only if adjusted net earnings (as therein defined) for 12 consecutive months out of the 18 months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least twice the annual interest requirements on all outstanding bonds (including Class A Bonds) and New Bonds to be outstanding (New Bond Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2003 the New Bond Ratio was 4.87. SCE&Gs Restated Articles of Incorporation (the Articles) prohibit issuance of additional shares of preferred stock without the consent of the preferred shareholders unless net earnings (as defined therein) for the 12 consecutive months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least one and one half times the aggregate of all interest charges and preferred stock dividend requirements on all shares of preferred stock outstanding immediately after the proposed issue (Preferred Stock Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2003 the Preferred Stock Ratio was 1.55. The Articles also require the consent of a majority of the total voting power of SCE&Gs preferred stock before SCE&G may issue or assume any unsecured indebtedness if, after such issue or assumption, the total principal amount of all such unsecured indebtedness would exceed ten percent of the aggregate principal amount of all of SCE&Gs secured indebtedness and capital and surplus (the ten percent test). No such consent is required to enter into agreements for payment of principal, interest and premium for securities issued for pollution control purposes. At December 31, 2003 the ten percent test would have limited issuances of unsecured indebtedness to approximately $413.5 million. Unsecured indebtedness at December 31, 2003 totaled approximately $94.4 million, and was comprised of short term borrowings. In 2002 SCE&G entered into an agreement with the South Carolina Transportation Infrastructure Bank (the Bank) and the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) that allows SCE&G to borrow funds from the Bank to construct a roadbed for SCDOT in connection with the Lake Murray Dam remediation project. The loan agreement provides for interest free borrowings for costs incurred not to exceed $59 million, with such borrowings being repaid over ten years from the initial borrowing. At December 31, 2003 SCE&G had not borrowed under the agreement, but expects to fully draw these amounts in 2004. Any such amounts would be included in the ten percent test. Financing Cash Flows During 2003 SCE&G experienced net cash inflows related to financing activities of approximately $106 million primarily arising from borrowings in support of SCE&Gs construction program and for other general corporate purposes. In anticipation of the issuance of debt, SCE&G may use interest rate lock or similar agreements to manage interest rate risk. Payments received or made upon termination of such agreements are recorded within other deferred debits or credits on the balance sheet and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. In connection with the issuance of First Mortgage Bonds in May 2003, SCE&G paid approximately $11.9 million upon the termination of a treasury lock agreement. In connection with the issuance of First Mortgage Bonds in December 2003, SCE&G paid approximately $3.5 million upon the termination of a forward starting interest rate swap. For additional information on significant financing transactions see the Consolidated Statements of Capitalization and Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS In the years 2001 through 2003, SCE&Gs capital expenditures for environmental control totaled approximately $168.5 million. These expenditures were in addition to expenditures included in "Other operation and maintenance" expenses, which were approximately $23.5 million, $23.7 million, and $17.0 million during 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. It is not possible to estimate all future costs related to environmental matters, but forecasts for capitalized environmental expenditures for SCE&G are $23.2 million for 2004 and $106.7 million for the four year period 2005 through 2008. These expenditures are included in SCE&Gs construction program discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources and include the matters discussed below. Electric Operations The Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990 required electric utilities to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides (NOx) substantially by the year 2000. SCE&G remains in compliance with these requirements. In 1998 the EPA required the State of South Carolina, among other states, to modify its state implementation plan (SIP) to address the issue of NOx pollution. The States SIP requires additional emissions reductions in 2004 and beyond. Further, the EPA indicated that it would finalize regulations by December 2004 for stricter limits on mercury and other pollutants generated by coal fired plants. The EPA has undertaken an aggressive enforcement initiative against the utilities industry, and the DOJ has brought suit against a number of utilities in federal court alleging violations of the CAA. At least two of these suits have either been tried or have had substantive motions decided one favorable to the industry and one not. Neither is binding as precedent on SCE&G. Prior to the suits, those utilities had received requests for information under Section 114 of the CAA and were issued Notices of Violation. The basis for these suits is the assertion by the EPA that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities over the past 20 or more years constitute "major modifications" which would have required the installation of costly Best Available Control Technology (BACT). SCE&G has received and responded to Section 114 requests for information related to Canadys and Wateree Stations. The regulations under the CAA provide certain exemptions to the definition of "major modifications," including an exemption for routine repair, replacement or maintenance. On October 27, 2003 EPA published a final revised NSR rule in the Federal Register with an effective date of December 26, 2003. The new rule represents an industry favorable departure from certain positions advanced by the federal government in the NSR enforcement initiative. However, on motion of several Northeastern states, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stayed the effect of the final rule. The ultimate application of the final rule to SCE&G is uncertain. SCE&G has analyzed each of the activities covered by the EPAs requests and believes each of these activities is covered by the exemption for routine repair, replacement and maintenance under what it believes is a fair reading of both the prior regulation and the contested revised regulation. The regulations also provide an exemption for an increase in emissions resulting from increased hours of operation or production rate and from demand growth. The current state of continued DOJ enforcement actions is the subject of speculation industry wide, but it is possible that the EPA will commence enforcement actions against SCE&G, and the EPA has the authority to seek penalties at the rate of up to $27,500 per day for each violation. The EPA also could seek installation of BACT (or equivalent) at the two plants. SCE&G believes that any enforcement actions relative to SCE&Gs compliance with the CAA would be without merit. However, if successful, such actions could have a material adverse effect on SCE&Gs financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. To comply with current and anticipated state and federal regulations, SCE&G expects to incur capital expenditures totaling approximately $129.9 million over the 2004 2008 period to retrofit existing facilities, with increased operation and maintenance costs of approximately $1.2 million per year. To meet compliance requirements for the years 2009 through 2013, SCE&G anticipates additional capital expenditures of approximately $52.6 million. The Clean Water Act, as amended, provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require treatment for wastewater discharges. Under this Act, compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program. Discharge permits have been issued for all and renewed for nearly all of SCE&Gs generating units. Concurrent with renewal of these permits, the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program of monitoring and controlling thermal discharges and strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams. SCE&G is developing compliance plans for these initiatives. Congress is expected to consider further amendments to the Clean Water Act in 2004. Such legislation may include limitations to mixing zones, the implementation of technology based standards for main condenser cooling water including intake and discharge structures and toxicity based standards. These provisions, if passed, could have a material impact on the financial condition and results of operations and cash flows of SCE&G. Nuclear Fuel Disposal The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 required that the United States government make available by 1998 a permanent repository for high level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel and imposes a fee of 1.0 mil per KWh of net nuclear generation after April 7, 1983. Payments, which began in 1983, are subject to change and will extend through the operating life of SCE&Gs Summer Station. SCE&G entered into a contract with the DOE in 1983 providing for permanent disposal of its spent nuclear fuel by the DOE. The DOE presently estimates that the permanent storage facility will not be available until 2010. SCE&G has on site spent nuclear fuel storage capability until at least 2018 and expects to be able to expand its storage capacity to accommodate the spent nuclear fuel output for the life of the plant through spent fuel pool reracking, dry cask storage or other technology as it becomes available. The Act also imposes on utilities the primary responsibility for storage of their spent nuclear fuel until the repository is available. On January 28, 2004 SCE&G and Santee Cooper (one third owner of Summer Station) filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims against the DOE for breach of the above contract. The contract known as the Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and or High Level Radioactive Waste (Standard Contract), required the federal government to accept and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and high level radioactive waste beginning not later than January 31, 1998, in exchange for agreed payments fixed in the Standard Contract at particular amounts. As of the date of filing, the federal government has accepted no spent fuel from Summer Station or any other utility for transport and disposal, and has indicated that it does not anticipate doing so until 2010, at the earliest. As a consequence of the federal governments breach of contract, the plaintiffs have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs There are two additional causes of action alleged as well damages for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and a takings claim demanding just compensation for the taking of the plaintiffs real property (necessitated by the storage). This lawsuit is one of 48 similar lawsuits brought by nuclear utilities as of January 29, 2004. Gas Distribution SCE&G maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could require environmental cleanup. As site assessments are initiated, estimates are made of the amount of expenditures, if any, deemed necessary to investigate and clean up each site. These estimates are refined as additional information becomes available; therefore, actual expenditures could differ significantly from the original estimates. Amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and cleanup relate solely to regulated operations and are recorded in deferred debits and amortized with recovery provided through rates. Deferred amounts, net of amounts previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements, totaled $10.9 million and $17.9 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively. The deferral includes the estimated costs associated with the following matters: o SCE&G owns a decommissioned MGP site in the Calhoun Park area of Charleston, South Carolina. The site is currently being remediated for benzene contamination in the intermediate aquifer on surrounding properties. SCE&G anticipates that the remaining remediation activities will be completed by the end of 2004, with certain monitoring and other activities continuing until 2007. As of December 31, 2003, SCE&G has spent approximately $19.7 million to remediate the Calhoun Park site, and expects to spend an additional $2.2 million. o SCE&G owns three other decommissioned MGP sites in South Carolina which contain residues of by product chemicals. Two of these sites are currently being remediated under work plans approved by DHEC. SCE&G is continuing to investigate the remaining site and is monitoring the nature and extent of residual contamination. In addition, in March 2003 SCE&G signed a consent agreement with DHEC related to a site formerly owned by SCE&G. The site contained residue material that was moved from an MGP. The removal action for this site has been completed. SCE&G anticipates that major remediation activities for the three owned sites will be completed before 2006. As of December 31, 2003, SCE&G has spent approximately $3.0 million related to these three sites, and expects to incur an additional $5.0 million. REGULATORY MATTERS SCE&G is subject to the jurisdiction of the SCPSC as to retail electric and gas rates, service, accounting, issuance of securities (other than short term borrowings) and other matters. Material retail rate proceedings are described in more detail in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. In conjunction with a January 2003 order, the SCPSC allowed SCE&G to include all Jasper County generating station project expenditures as of December 31, 2002 and other construction work in progress expenditures as of June 30, 2002 in electric rate base. Once this generating station is complete, SCE&G may seek to include the remaining project expenditures in electric rate base. Construction expenditures for the Lake Murray Dam construction project, which totaled approximately $169 million as of December 31, 2003, have not been included in its electric rate base. When the Lake Murray project is completed in 2005, SCE&G will determine whether to seek inclusion of such expenditures in electric rate base. Synthetic Fuel Investments SCE&G holds two equity method investments in partnerships involved in converting coal to non conventional fuel, the use of which fuel qualifies for federal income tax credits. The aggregate investment in these partnerships as of December 31, 2003 is approximately $2.5 million, and through December 31, 2003, they have generated and passed through to SCE&G approximately $97.4 million in such tax credits. At December 31, 2003 SCE&G has recorded on its balance sheet $66.6 million deferred fuel tax benefits, which include partnership losses, net of tax. Under a plan approved by the SCPSC, any tax credits generated and ultimately passed through to SCE&G from synfuel produced and consumed by SCE&G, net of partnership losses and other expenses, have been and will be deferred and will be applied to offset the capital costs of projects required to comply with legislative or regulatory actions. See Note 1B to the consolidated financial statements. The IRS has completed and closed examinations of the Companys consolidated federal income tax returns through the tax year ended in 2000, with the exception of the Companys interest in the synthetic fuel partnership, S. C. Coaltech No. 1 L.P. The IRS has notified the Company that it has begun the process of closing this partnership examination with no changes being proposed, and that a formal closing letter is forthcoming. The IRS audit report makes no challenge to the declaration that the synthetic fuel facility was properly placed in service, and takes no issue with evidence submitted demonstrating that the facility produces a qualifying fuel. On October 29, 2003, the IRS issued Announcement 2003 70 stating that it had completed a review of chemical change issues associated with tax credits claimed under IRC Section 29 relating to the production and sale of synthetic fuel. It further stated that it would resume the issuance of private letter rulings (PLRs) concerning synthetic fuel credits consistent with the guidelines regarding chemical change previously set forth in Revenue Procedures 2001 30 and 2001 34 and certain additional requirements related to sampling, testing and recordkeeping procedures, even though the IRS has indicated that the level of chemical change required under that guidance is not sufficient for IRC Section 29 purposes. The IRS also stated in the announcement that it would continue to issue PLRs because it recognized that many taxpayers and their investors have relied on its long standing ruling practice to make investments. In Announcement 2003 46 issued on June 27, 2003, the IRS had questioned the validity of certain test procedures and results that had been presented to it by taxpayers with interests in synfuel operations as evidence that the required significant chemical change had occurred, and had initiated a review of these test procedures and results which was completed as noted in Announcement 2003 70. Separately, the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations of the Government Affairs Committee of the United States Senate (Subcommittee) is conducting an investigation of potential abuses of tax credits by producers of synthetic fuel under IRC Section 29. The Subcommittee Chairman, in a memorandum commencing the investigation, has stated that he anticipates the investigation will focus on whether certain synthetic fuel producers are claiming tax credits even though their product is not a qualified synthetic fuel under Section 29 and IRS regulations. The memorandum also states that the investigation will address whether certain corporations are engaging in transactions solely to take advantage of unused Section 29 credits with no other business purpose, and the IRS efforts to curb abuses related to these credits. While the effect of these two developments is not clear, SCE&G is aware that PLRs have been issued since October 29, 2003. SCE&G has not had any communication with the Subcommittee staff, and with the imminent conclusion of the IRS audit, SCE&G continues to believe that all of its synthetic fuel tax credits have been properly claimed. Nuclear License Extension In August 2002 SCE&G filed an application with the NRC for a 20 year license extension for its Summer Station. If approved, the extension would allow the plant to operate through 2042. At December 31, 2003 SCE&G had capitalized approximately $8.0 million related to the application process and expects to capitalize an additional $1.0 million in 2004. SCE&G expects the extension to be granted in mid 2004. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Following are descriptions of SCE&Gs accounting policies which are new or most critical in terms of reporting financial condition or results of operations. Utility Regulation SCE&G is subject to the provisions of SFAS 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," which requires it to record certain assets and liabilities that defer the recognition of expenses and revenues to future periods as a result of being rate regulated. In the future, as a result of deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment, SCE&G may no longer meet the criteria for continued application of SFAS 71 and could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of SCE&Gs Electric Distribution and Gas Distribution segments in the period the write off would be recorded. It is not expected that cash flows or financial condition would be materially affected. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of SCE&Gs regulatory assets and liabilities, including those associated with SCE&Gs environmental assessment program. SCE&Gs generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market. If market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs, SCE&G could be required to write down its investment in these assets. SCE&G cannot predict whether any write downs will be necessary and, if they are, the extent to which they would adversely affect SCE&Gs results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded. As of December 31, 2003 SCE&Gs net investments in fossil/hydro and nuclear generation assets were approximately $2,113 million and $563 million, respectively. Revenue Recognition and Unbilled Revenues Revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual reading of their electric and gas meters, SCE&G records estimates for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. Such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to each customer since the date of the last reading of their respective meters. Such unbilled revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class, the effects of different rate schedules, changes in weather and, where applicable, the impact of weather normalization provisions of rate structures. The accrual of unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs. At December 31, 2003 and 2002, accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of $50.0 million and $43.9 million, respectively, compared to total revenues for 2003 and 2002 of $1.83 billion and $1.68 billion, respectively. Provisions for Bad Debts and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts As of each balance sheet date, SCE&G evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and records allowances for doubtful accounts based on estimates of the level of expected write offs. These estimates are based on, among other things, comparisons of the relative age of accounts, assigned credit ratings for commercial and industrial accounts, and consideration of actual write off history. SCE&Gs Electric Distribution and Gas Distribution segments have an established write off histories and the regulated service areas that enable them to reliably estimate their provisions for bad debts. Nuclear Decommissioning Accounting for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future. Among the factors that could change SCE&Gs accounting estimates related to decommissioning costs are changes in technology, changes in regulatory and environmental remediation requirements, as well as changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and timing of cash flows. SCE&G expects to receive a 20 year license extension for Summer Station that will significantly impact the eventual cost of and funding for decommissioning. See also the discussion of SCE&Gs adoption of SFAS 143, "Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations," below. Changes in any of these estimates could significantly impact SCE&Gs financial position and cash flows (although changes in such estimates should be earnings neutral, because these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers). SCE&Gs share of estimated site specific nuclear decommissioning costs for Summer Station, including the cost of decommissioning plant components not subject to radioactive contamination, totals approximately $357 million, stated in 1999 dollars, based on a decommissioning study completed in 2000. Santee Cooper is responsible for decommissioning costs related to its one third ownership interest in the station. The cost estimate is based on a decommissioning methodology acceptable to the NRC under which the site would be maintained over a period of approximately 60 years in such a manner as to allow for subsequent decontamination that permits release for unrestricted use. Under SCE&Gs method of funding decommissioning costs, funds collected through rates are used to pay premiums on insurance policies on the lives of certain Company and affiliate personnel. SCE&G is the beneficiary of these policies. Through these insurance contracts, SCE&G is able to take advantage of income tax benefits and accrue earnings on the fund on a tax deferred basis. Amounts for decommissioning collected through electric rates, insurance proceeds, and interest on proceeds, less expenses, are transferred by SCE&G to an external trust fund. Management intends for the fund, including earnings thereon, to provide for all eventual decommissioning expenditures on an after tax basis. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits SCE&G follows SFAS 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," in accounting for its defined benefit pension plan. SCE&Gs plan is fully funded and as such, net pension income is reflected in the financial statements (see Results of Operations). SFAS 87 requires the use of several assumptions, the selection of which may have a large impact on the resulting benefit recorded. Among the more sensitive assumptions are those surrounding discount rates and returns on assets. Net pension income of $6.8 million recorded in 2003 reflects the use of a 6.5% discount rate and an assumed 9.25% long term return on plan assets. SCE&G believes that these assumptions were, and that the resulting pension income amount was, reasonable. For purposes of comparison, using a discount rate of 6.0% in 2003 would have lowered SCE&Gs pension income approximately $1.7 million. Had the assumed long term return on assets been reduced to 9.0% in 2003, SCE&Gs pension income would have been reduced by approximately $1.5 million. In determining the appropriate discount rate, SCE&G considers the market indices of high quality long term fixed income securities. As such, SCE&G selected the beginning of year discount rate of 6.5% as being within a reasonable range of interest rates for obligations rated Aa by Moodys as of January 1, 2003. This same discount rate was also selected for determination of OPEB costs discussed below. The following information with respect to pension assets (and returns thereon) should also be noted: SCE&G determines the fair value of substantially all of its pension assets utilizing market quotes rather than utilizing any calculated values, "market related" values or other modeling techniques. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumptions, SCE&G evaluated input from actuaries and from pension fund investment advisors, including such advisors review of the plans historical 10, 16 and 25 year cumulative actual returns of 10.8%, 12.0% and 12.7%, respectively, all of which have all been in excess of related broad indices. SCE&G anticipates that the investment managers will continue to generate long term returns of at least 9.25%. The expected long term rate of return of 9.25% is based on a target asset allocation of 70% with equity managers and 30% with fixed income managers. Management regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the portfolio to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate. While investment performance in 2000 2002 and the recent decline in discount rate have significantly reduced the level of pension income, the pension trust has been and remains adequately funded, and no contributions have been required since 1997. As such, recent declines in pension income have had no impact on SCE&Gs cash flows. Based on stress testing performed by SCE&Gs actuaries, management does not anticipate the need to make pension contributions until after 2008. Similar to its pension accounting, SCE&G follows SFAS 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," in accounting for its postretirement medical and life insurance benefits. This plan is unfunded, so no assumptions related to return on assets impact the net expense recorded; however, the selection of discount rates can significantly impact the actuarial determination of net expense. SCE&G used a discount rate of 6.5% and recorded a net SFAS 106 cost of $13.1 million for 2003. Had the selected discount rate been 6.0%, the expense would have been approximately $0.4 million higher. Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143 provides guidance for recording and disclosing liabilities related to the future obligations to retire assets (ARO). SFAS 143 applies to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of long lived tangible assets that result from acquisition, construction, development and normal operation. Because such obligation relates solely to SCE&Gs regulated electric operations, adoption of SFAS 143 had no impact on results of operations; however, as of January 2003, SCE&G recorded an ARO of approximately $111 million, which exceeded the previously recorded reserve for nuclear plant decommissioning of approximately $87 million. At December 31, 2003 such ARO totaled approximately $118 million. SCE&G believes that there is legal uncertainty as to the existence of environmental obligations associated with certain transmission and distribution properties. SCE&G believes that any ARO related to this type of property would be insignificant and, due to the indeterminate life of the related assets, an ARO could not be reasonably estimated.
