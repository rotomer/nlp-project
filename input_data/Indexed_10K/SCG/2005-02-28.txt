Through its wholly owned regulated subsidiaries, SCANA is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in parts of South Carolina and the purchase, transmission and sale of natural gas in portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. Through a wholly owned nonregulated subsidiary, SCANA markets natural gas to retail customers in Georgia and to wholesale customers primarily in the southeast. Other wholly owned nonregulated subsidiaries perform power plant management and maintenance services and provide service contracts to homeowners on certain home appliances and heating and air conditioning units. Additionally, a service company subsidiary of SCANA provides administrative, management and other services to the other subsidiaries. 31 Following are percentages of the Companys revenues and net income earned by regulated and nonregulated businesses and the percentage of total assets held by them. % of Revenues 2004 2003 2002 Regulated 71 % 73 % 75 % Nonregulated 29 % 27 % 25 % % of Net Income (Loss) 2004(1) 2003 2002(2) Regulated 106 % 92 % 10 % Nonregulated (6 )% 8 % (110 )% % of Assets 2004 2003 2002 Regulated 95 % 93 % 91 % Nonregulated 5 % 7 % 9 % (1)In 2004, net income for regulated businesses totaled $272.0 million and net loss for nonregulated businesses totaled $14.9 million. Net loss for nonregulated businesses included impairments and losses recognized on the sale of certain of the Companys telecommunications investments ($29.8 million, net of tax) and a charge related to pending litigation associated with the Companys 1999 sale of its propane assets ($11.1 million, net of taxes). See Results of Operations for more information. (2)In 2002, net income for regulated businesses totaled $13.6 million and net loss for nonregulated businesses totaled $155.3 million. Net income for regulated subsidiaries included an impairment charge related to the acquisition adjustment associated with PSNC Energy ($230 million, net of tax). Net loss for nonregulated businesses included impairment charges for the Companys telecommunications investments ($189.2 million, net of tax), which were partially offset by gains the Company recognized from the sale of a radio service network ($9.4 million, net of tax) and the sale of DTAG shares ($15.3 million, net of tax). See Results of Operations for more information. Electric Operations The electric operations segment is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, GENCO and Fuel Company, and is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in South Carolina. At December 31, 2004 SCE&G provided electricity to over 580,000 customers in an area of approximately 15,000 square miles. GENCO owns and operates a coal fired generation station and sells electricity solely to SCE&G. Fuel Company acquires, owns and provides financing for SCE&Gs nuclear fuel, fossil fuel and sulfur dioxide emission allowance requirements. Operating results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for electricity, the ability to control costs and rates allowed to be charged to customers. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity. The allowed return on equity for SCE&G was 12.45% in 2004. In January 2005, as a result of an electric rate case, the allowed return on equity was lowered to a range of 10.4% to 11.4%, with rates to be set at 10.7%. See further discussion at Liquidity and Capital Resources. Demand for electricity is primarily affected by weather, customer growth and the economy. Legislative and regulatory initiatives also could significantly impact the results of operations and cash flows for the electric operations segment. In South Carolina the state legislature is not actively pursuing electric restructuring. However, both houses of the U.S. Congress introduced energy legislation in the 2003 2004 legislative sessions, but failed to reach a compromise on certain key issues unrelated to utilities. Energy legislation is expected to be reintroduced in 2005. It is anticipated that 32 such legislation would include provisions that would repeal PUHCA and transfer additional regulatory authority to FERC. Provisions in the legislation would likely impose reliability standards for high voltage transmission systems. New legislation may also impose stringent requirements on power plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and mercury. It is also possible that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The Company cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted, and if it is, the conditions it would impose on utilities. In April 2004 the joint U.S. Canada Power System Outage Task Force issued its "Final Report on the August 14, 2003 Blackout in the United States and Canada: Causes and Recommendations" (Blackout Report). The Blackout Report contains 46 recommendations that, if implemented, the Task Force believes would improve reliability of North Americas interconnected bulk power system (the grid). Full implementation of the Blackout Reports recommendations would require a number of actions by legislative, regulatory and industry participants. However, the Blackout Report asserts as its single most important recommendation that the U.S. Congress should enact tougher reliability standards. It is anticipated that any reliability legislation, if passed, would make reliability standards mandatory and enforceable with penalties for non compliance and would strengthen the role of FERC. Regardless of the outcome of any legislative activity, FERC is expected to proceed with regulatory initiatives that, if enacted, could significantly change the countrys existing regulatory framework governing transmission, open access and energy markets and would attempt, in large measure, to standardize the national energy market and attempt to disaggregate the remaining vertically integrated utilities. In July 2002 FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Standard Market Design (SMD) which FERC supplemented with the issuance of a "white paper" in April 2003. If implemented, the proposed rule could have a significant impact on SCE&Gs access to or cost of power for its native load customers and on SCE&Gs marketing of power outside its service territory. The Company is currently evaluating FERCs action to determine potential effects on SCE&Gs operations. Additional directives from FERC are expected. The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) also is expected to continue its initiatives to develop, establish and enforce additional standards for the grid. To that end, NERC is working closely with FERC to implement stronger reliability standards among NERCs voluntary membership. SCE&G, along with other NERC members, is also working closely with NERC in these efforts. Such initiatives could be significantly influenced by any reliability legislation enacted by Congress. The Company cannot predict whether Congress will enact reliability legislation or the extent to which the other recommendations contained in the Blackout Report will be implemented. Any action by Congress or initiatives by FERC or NERC could significantly impact SCE&Gs access to or cost of power for its native load customers and SCE&Gs marketing of power outside its service territory. Gas Distribution The gas distribution segment is comprised of the distribution operations of SCE&G and PSNC Energy, and is primarily engaged in the purchase, transmission and sale of natural gas in portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. At December 31, 2004 this segment provided natural gas to more than 690,000 customers in an area of approximately 34,000 square miles. Operating results for gas distribution are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas, the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity, which in 2004 was 12.25% for SCE&G and 11.4% for PSNC Energy. Demand for natural gas is primarily affected by weather, customer growth, the economy and, for commercial and industrial customers, the availability and price of alternate fuels. Natural gas competes with electricity, propane and heating oil to serve the heating and, to a lesser extent, other household energy needs of residential and small commercial customers. This competition is generally based on price and convenience. Large commercial and industrial customers 33 often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel, such as propane or fuel oil. Natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price. As a result, any significant disparity between supply and demand, either of natural gas or of alternate fuels, and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors, will affect price and impact the Companys ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers. Gas Transmission For 2004 the gas transmission segment was comprised of SCPC, which owns and operates an intrastate pipeline engaged in the purchase, transmission and sale of natural gas on a wholesale basis to distribution companies (including SCE&G) and industrial customers throughout most of South Carolina. Operating results for 2004 were primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas, the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers. Embedded in these rates is an allowed regulatory return on equity, which in 2004 was 12.5% to 16.5%. Demand for natural gas is primarily affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth. SCPC supplies natural gas to SCE&G for its resale to gas distribution customers and for certain electric generation needs. SCPC also sells natural gas to large commercial and industrial customers in South Carolina and faces the same competitive pressures as the gas distribution segment for these classes of customers. In 2005, SCANA expects to merge SCPC with another subsidiary, SCG Pipeline, which owns and operates an interstate pipeline that transports natural gas from southeast Georgia to South Carolina and delivers natural gas to SCE&Gs Jasper County Electric Generating Station. The merger is subject to customary closing conditions and FERC approval. Assuming the merger is completed, the new company will operate as an interstate pipeline engaged in the transmission of natural gas in southeast Georgia and South Carolina. The new companys rates for transmission services, including an allowed return on equity, would be set and regulated by FERC. Retail Gas Marketing SCANA Energy, a division of SEMI, comprises the retail gas marketing segment. This segment markets natural gas to over 470,000 customers (as of December 31, 2004) throughout Georgia. SCANA Energys total customer base represents about a 30 percent share of the approximately 1.5 million customers in Georgias deregulated natural gas market. SCANA Energy remains the second largest natural gas marketer in the state. SCANA Energys competitors include affiliates of other large energy companies with experience in Georgias energy market as well as several electric membership cooperatives. SCANA Energys ability to maintain its market share depends on the prices it charges customers relative to the prices charged by its competitors, its ability to continue to provide high levels of customer service and other factors. In addition, the pipeline capacity available for SCANA Energy to serve industrial and other customers is tied to the market share held by SCANA Energy in the retail market. As Georgias regulated provider, SCANA Energy serves low income customers at rates approved by the GPSC and receives funding from the Universal Service Fund for bad debts. At December 31, 2004 SCANA Energys regulated division served approximately 60,000 customers. In 2004 the GPSC extended SCANA Energys term as the regulated provider through August 2005. In 2005, using a request for proposal process, the GPSC will select a regulated provider for the two year period beginning September 1, 2005. SCANA Energy intends to submit a bid during this process. SCANA Energy and SCANAs other natural gas distribution, transmission and marketing segments maintain gas inventory and also utilize forward contracts and financial instruments, including futures contracts and options, to manage their exposure to fluctuating commodity natural gas prices. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. As a part of this risk management process, at any given time, a portion of SCANAs projected natural gas needs has been purchased or otherwise placed 34 under contract. Since SCANA Energy operates in a competitive market, it may be unable to sustain its current levels of customers and or pricing, thereby reducing expected margins and profitability. Energy Marketing The divisions of SEMI, excluding SCANA Energy, comprise the energy marketing segment. This segment markets natural gas primarily in the southeast and provides energy related risk management services to producers and customers. The operating results for energy marketing are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas and the ability to control costs. Demand for natural gas is primarily affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Companys reported earnings (loss) are prepared in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that, in addition to reported earnings (loss) under GAAP, the Companys GAAP adjusted net earnings from operations provides a meaningful representation of its fundamental earnings power and can aid in performing period over period financial analysis and comparison with peer group data. In managements opinion, GAAP adjusted net earnings from operations is a useful indicator of the financial results of the Companys primary businesses. This measure is also a basis for managements provision of earnings guidance and growth projections, and it is used by management in making resource allocation and other budgetary and operational decisions. This non GAAP performance measure is not intended to replace the GAAP measure of net earnings, but is offered as a supplement to it. A reconciliation of reported (GAAP) earnings (loss) per share to GAAP adjusted net earnings from operations per share, as well as cash dividend information, is provided in the table below: 2004 2003 2002 Reported (GAAP) earnings (loss) per share $ 2.30 $ 2.54 $ (1.34 ) Less realized gains from sales of telecommunications investments and assets (.35 ) (.24 ) Plus realized losses from sales of telecommunications investments and assets .14 Plus telecommunications investment impairments .13 .31 1.79 Plus charge related to pending litigation .10 Plus cumulative effect of accounting change 2.17 GAAP adjusted net earnings from operations per share $ 2.67 $ 2.50 $ 2.38 Cash dividends declared (per share) $ 1.46 $ 1.38 $ 1.30 Discussion of above adjustments: Realized gains (losses) on telecommunications investments of $(.14), $.35 and $.24 were recognized in 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and arose as a result of the Companys previously announced plans to monetize these telecommunications investments. All significant investments have now been monetized. The after tax loss of $.14 per share in 2004 relates to the sale of substantially all of the Company holdings in ITC^DeltaCom, Inc. (ITC^DeltaCom) and Knology, Inc. (Knology) in December of 2004. Proceeds from these sales in the amount of approximately $63 million, and the cash refund resulting from tax loss carrybacks to be received in 2005 (estimated to be $58 million) are expected to be used for debt reduction. The gain of $.35 per share in 2003 arose from the sale of the Companys interest in ITC Holding Company (ITC Holding) and the receipt of a minority investment interest in a newly 35 formed entity, Magnolia Holding Company, LLC (Magnolia Holding). In 2002, the Company recognized after tax gains of $.09 per share and $.15 per share related to the sale of a radio service network and shares of DTAG, respectively. The DTAG investment had been received in exchange for a previously held investment interest in Powertel, Inc. (Powertel). Telecommunications investment impairments were recorded as follows: 2004 2003 2002 DTAG $ (1.72 ) ITC^DeltaCom (.07 ) Knology $ (.13 ) $ (.31 ) As noted above, the Company exchanged a previous investment in Powertel for DTAG shares, resulting in the recording of a $3.38 per share gain in 2001. The DTAG shares experienced a significant decline in market value after that exchange but prior to their sale in 2002. The Companys ITC^DeltaCom shares experienced a significant impairment upon ITC^DeltaComs filing for bankruptcy in 2002, while the Companys Knology holdings experienced other than temporary impairments in 2003 and 2004. As noted previously, the Companys investments in Knology and ITC^DeltaCom were monetized in December 2004. Upon adoption of SFAS 142 in 2002, the Company recorded an impairment charge related to the goodwill recorded upon the acquisition of PSNC Energy. Annual evaluations of the carrying value of goodwill in subsequent periods have not resulted in similar charges. In 2004, a jury issued its verdict in a case in which an unsuccessful bidder for the purchase of certain of SCANAs propane gas assets in 1999 alleged breach of contract and related claims. Based on this verdict, the Company recorded a charge of $.10 per share, its best estimate of the minimum award to be granted if the courts final judgment is consistent with the jury verdict and the Companys understanding of applicable law. It is expected that the final judgment will be rendered in 2005 but that appeals may continue for a longer period. See also Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Management believes that all of the above adjustments are appropriate in determining the non GAAP financial performance measure. Management utilizes such measure itself in exerting budgetary control, managing business operations and determining eligibility for incentive compensation payments. Such non GAAP measure is based on managements decision that the telecommunications assets are not a part of the Companys core businesses and will not be available to provide earnings on a long term basis. The non GAAP measure also provides a consistent basis upon which to measure performance by properly excluding the effects on per share earnings of transactions involving the Companys telecommunications investments, the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting standard and a litigation charge related to the sale of a prior business. 36 Pension Income Pension income was recorded on the Companys financial statements as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Millions of dollars Income Statement Impact: (Component of) reduction in employee benefit costs $ 2.9 $ (2.3 ) $ 10.9 Other income 10.8 7.9 11.1 Balance Sheet Impact: (Component of) reduction in capital expenditures 1.0 (0.5 ) 3.1 Component of (reduction in) amount due to Summer Station co owner 0.4 (0.1 ) 0.7 Total Pension Income $ 15.1 $ 5.0 $ 25.8 For the last several years, the market value of the Companys retirement plan (pension) assets has exceeded the total actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits. Pension incomes sharp decline in 2003 and its increase in 2004 are consistent with overall investment market results. See also the discussion of pension accounting in Critical Accounting Estimates. Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFC) AFC is a utility accounting practice whereby a portion of the cost of both equity and borrowed funds used to finance construction (which is shown on the balance sheet as construction work in progress) is capitalized. The Company includes an equity portion of AFC in nonoperating income and a debt portion of AFC in interest charges (credits) as noncash items, both of which have the effect of increasing reported net income. AFC represented approximately 6.6% of income before income taxes in 2004, 7.2% in 2003 and 25.8% in 2002. The ratio in 2002 was significantly higher than historical norms due to the inclusion in income before income taxes of $291 million of impairments related to the other than temporary decline in market value of the Companys investment in DTAG and ITC^DeltaCom. In addition to the effect of impairments, the decrease in AFC for 2004 vs 2003 is partially due to completion of the Jasper County Electric Generating Station in May 2004. The decrease in AFC for 2003 vs 2002 is partially due to the completion of the Urquhart Station repowering project in June 2002. Also, in January 2003 the SCPSC issued an order allowing SCE&G to include all Jasper County generating project expenditures as of December 31, 2002 and other construction work in progress expenditures as of June 30, 2002 in its electric rate base. At the time the expenditures were included in the rate base, AFC was no longer calculated on those amounts. These decreases were partially offset by increased AFC from subsequent construction expenditures related to the Jasper County generating and Lake Murray Dam projects (see discussion at CAPITAL PROJECTS). Electric Operations Electric Operations is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, GENCO and Fuel Company. Electric operations sales margins for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Millions of dollars Operating revenues $ 1,687.7 15.1 % $ 1,466.5 6.3 % $ 1,379.5 Less: Fuel used in generation 466.9 39.7 % 334.1 1.4 % 329.6 Purchased power 50.7 (20.8 )% 64.0 52.0 % 42.1 Margin $ 1,170.1 9.5 % $ 1,068.4 6.0 % $ 1,007.8 37 2004 vs 2003 Margin increased primarily due to increased off system sales of $47.2 million, increased customer growth and consumption of $22.9 million, $22.3 million due to favorable weather and $7.1 million due to the increase in retail electric base rates effective February 2003. Fuel used in generation increased approximately $103.0 million due to increased availability of generation facilities and approximately $30.0 million due to increased cost of coal. Purchased power decreased due to greater availability of generation facilities. 2003 vs 2002 Margin increased primarily due to the increase in retail electric base rates effective February 2003 totaling $63.6 million and customer growth and increased consumption of $24.3 million, partially offset by $27.3 million due to less favorable weather. Fuel used in generation increased by $9.3 million due to the increased cost of natural gas and fuel oil for the Urquhart combined cycle gas turbines and by $1.1 million due to the increased cost of nuclear fuel, partially offset by $5.5 million due to planned plant outages throughout the year. Purchased power increased due to planned plant outages throughout the year. MWh sales volumes by classes, related to the electric margin above, were as follows: Classification (in thousands) 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Residential 7,460 6.6 % 6,998 (3.2 )% 7,230 Commercial 6,900 4.4 % 6,607 (0.8 )% 6,658 Industrial 6,775 3.5 % 6,548 0.7 % 6,505 Sales for resale (excluding interchange) 2,472 71.9 % 1,438 (0.7 )% 1,448 Other 526 5.2 % 500 (6.5 )% 535 Total territorial 24,133 9.2 % 22,091 (1.3 )% 22,376 NMST 898 * 425 (40.1 )% 709 Total 25,031 11.2 % 22,516 (2.5 )% 23,085 *Greater than 100% 2004 vs 2003 Territorial sales volumes increased primarily due to more favorable weather, customer growth and consumption and increased off system sales. NMST volumes increased primarily due to increased availability of generating plants that increased volumes available for resale. 2003 vs 2002 Territorial sales volume decreased primarily due to less favorable weather. NMST volumes decreased primarily due to planned outages at generation plants that reduced volumes available for resale. 38 Gas Distribution Gas Distribution is comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G and PSNC Energy. Gas distribution sales margins (including transactions with affiliates) for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Millions of dollars Operating revenues $ 913.9 5.2 % $ 869.0 32.9 % $ 653.9 Less: Gas purchased for resale 655.1 9.3 % 599.3 49.5 % 401.0 Margin $ 258.8 (4.0 )% $ 269.7 6.6 % $ 252.9 2004 vs 2003 Margin decreased primarily due to a decrease in SCE&Gs billing surcharge for the recovery of environmental remediation expenses of $5.0 million, lower residential and commercial sales volumes of $2.5 million and $5.1 million due to milder weather. This was partially offset by customer growth at PSNC of $4.0 million. 2003 vs 2002 Margin increased primarily due to customer growth and increased consumption totaling $20.9 million, partially offset by a decrease in industrial usage of $4.1 million primarily due to an unfavorable competitive position of natural gas relative to alternate fuels. DT sales volumes by classes, including transportation gas, were as follows: Classification (in thousands) 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Residential 37,231 (3.4 )% 38,542 8.0 % 35,674 Commercial 27,271 (1.6 )% 27,715 11.2 % 24,927 Industrial 19,320 (3.9 )% 20,109 (5.4 )% 21,247 Transportation gas 28,216 11.1 % 25,387 (15.8 )% 30,166 Sales for resale 1 1 1 Total 112,039 0.3 % 111,754 (0.2 )% 112,015 2004 vs 2003 Residential and commercial sales volumes decreased primarily due to unfavorable consumption patterns. Transportation volumes increased in 2004 primarily as a result of interruptible customers using gas instead of alternative fuels. 2003 vs 2002 Residential and commercial sales volumes increased primarily due to more favorable weather. Industrial and transportation volumes decreased in 2003 primarily as a result of interruptible customers using their alternate fuel sources during the year. 39  Gas Transmission Gas Transmission is comprised of the operations of SCPC. Gas transmission sales margins (including transactions with affiliates) for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Millions of dollars Operating revenues $ 550.9 6.0 % $ 519.8 8.5 % $ 479.1 Less: Gas purchased for resale 496.9 5.2 % 472.2 6.7 % 442.4 Margin $ 54.0 13.4 % $ 47.6 29.7 % $ 36.7 2004 vs 2003 Margin increased primarily due to higher transportation and reservation revenue as a result of new firm transportation contracts. 2003 vs 2002 Margin increased primarily due to the favorable competitive position of natural gas relative to alternate fuels in the first quarter of $13.6 million, partially offset by the unfavorable competitive position of natural gas relative to alternate fuels in the second, third and fourth quarters of $1.5 million. DT sales volumes by classes including transportation were as follows: Classification (in thousands) 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Commercial 113 5.6 % 107 (9.3 )% 118 Industrial 28,625 (8.9 )% 31,436 (32.5 )% 46,578 Transportation 25,252 * 12,262 * 3,757 Sales for resale 42,946 (9.4 )% 47,391 (16.7 )% 56,906 Total 96,936 6.3 % 91,196 (15.1 )% 107,359 *Greater than 100% 2004 vs 2003 Industrial volumes decreased approximately 2.8 million DTs primarily due to decreased electric generation. Transportation volumes increased approximately 7.5 million DTs due to a new contract with a firm transportation customer and approximately 4.9 million DTs due to new transportation contracts with resale customers. Sales for resale volumes decreased approximately 4.4 million DTs primarily due to the new transportation contracts with resale customers stated above. 2003 vs 2002 Industrial volumes decreased approximately 6.0 million DTs due to decreased electric generation and approximately 8.8 million DTs due to competitiveness with alternate fuels. Transportation volumes increased approximately 9.1 million DTs and sales for resale volumes decreased approximately 9.4 million DTs primarily as a result of new transportation contracts with resale customers in 2003. 40 Retail Gas Marketing Retail Gas Marketing is comprised of SCANA Energy, which operates in Georgias natural gas market. Retail Gas Marketing revenues and net income for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Millions of dollars Operating revenues $ 552.0 23.1 % $ 448.3 18.1 % $ 379.5 Net income 29.0 44.3 % 20.1 40.6 % 14.3 2004 vs 2003 Operating revenues increased primarily as a result of increased volumes and higher average retail prices. Net income increased primarily due to higher margins of $16.7 million, partially offset by increased bad debt of $2.9 million, increased depreciation expense of $0.7 million and higher customer service expenses of $2.0 million. 2003 vs 2002 Operating revenues increased primarily as a result of higher average retail prices and increased volumes. Net income increased primarily due to increased margins of $10.8 million, partially offset by increased bad debt expense of $3.2 million, increased interest expense of $0.5 million and higher operating expenses of $0.3 million. Delivered volumes for 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaled approximately 37.9 million, 35.6 million and 33.8 million DT, respectively. Energy Marketing Energy Marketing is comprised of the Companys non regulated marketing operations, excluding SCANA Energy. Energy Marketing operating revenues and net loss for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Millions of dollars Operating revenues $ 596.5 43.5 % $ 415.7 31.2 % $ 316.8 Net loss (2.0 ) (81.8 )% (1.1 ) (37.5 )% (0.8 ) 2004 vs 2003 Operating revenues increased $180.8 million due to higher market prices and higher sales volumes. Net loss increased primarily due to higher operating expenses of $2.0 million partially offset by higher margins of $0.8 million. 2003 vs 2002 Operating revenues increased $98.9 million which reflects a $146.0 million increase due to higher natural gas prices and a $45.9 million decrease due to lower volumes. Net loss increased primarily due to lower margins of $2.5 million partially offset by lower operating expenses of $2.3 million. Delivered volumes for 2004, 2003 and 2002 totaled approximately 91.8 million, 73.6 million and 86.2 million DT, respectively. Delivered volumes increased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily as a result of service to the Jasper County Electric Generating Station in 2004, which created 11.2 million DT of additional volume. Such intercompany sales are not eliminated, in accordance with SFAS 71 (see Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements). Delivered volumes decreased in 2003 compared to 2002 by approximately 2.7 million DT due to decreased industrial usage and by approximately 9.8 million DT due to fewer customers caused by a sluggish economy and related customer credit constraints. 41 Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses were as follows: 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Millions of dollars Other operation and maintenance $ 607.5 8.8 % $ 558.3 6.9 % $ 522.2 Depreciation and amortization 265.1 11.2 % 238.3 8.3 % 220.0 Other taxes 145.6 4.6 % 139.2 9.7 % 126.9 Total $ 1,018.2 8.8 % $ 935.8 7.7 % $ 869.1 2004 vs 2003 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to increased labor and benefit expense of $26.3 million, higher bad debt expense of $5.8 million, increased expenses at the generation plants of $11.0 million, winter storm expense of $2.5 million and increased gas marketing and customer billing costs of $4.2 million, partially offset by increased pension income of $5.2 million. Depreciation and amortization increased by $13.4 million due to completion of the Jasper County Electric Generating Station and $11.1 million as a result of normal net property additions. Other taxes increased primarily due to increased property taxes. 2003 vs 2002 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to lower pension income of $13.2 million, increased labor and benefit costs of $8.3 million, increased bad debt expense of $6.5 million, increased nuclear operating expenses of $4.5 million and increased other operating expenses of $3.6 million. Depreciation and amortization increased by $11.4 million due to normal net property additions, $4.2 million due to the completion of the Urquhart Station repowering project in June 2002 and $2.7 million due to amortization of franchise fees. Other taxes increased primarily due to increased property taxes. Other Income Components of other income, excluding the equity component of AFC, were as follows: 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Millions of dollars Gain (loss) on sale of investments $ (21.0 ) * $ 59.8 * $ 23.6 Gain on sale of assets 0.7 (41.7 )% 1.2 (92.7 )% 16.4 Impairment of investments (26.9 ) (49.3 )% (53.1 ) (81.7 )% (290.7 ) Other income 24.2 (49.5 )% 47.9 (0.8 )% 48.3 Total $ (23.0 ) * $ 55.8 * $ (202.4 ) *Greater than 100% In 2004 the Company recognized a $21 million loss on the sale of investments in Knology and ITC^DeltaCom. In 2003 a $59.8 million gain on sale of investments was recognized in connection with the sale of ITC Holding and the receipt of an investment interest in a newly formed entity (Magnolia Holding). In 2002 $23.6 million was recognized upon the sale of the Companys DTAG stock. Gain on sale of assets in 2002 included the sale of the Companys radio system to Motorola. Impairments recorded in 2002 included those related to DTAG and ITC^DeltaCom, while impairments in 2003 related solely to the investment in Knology. In 2004 impairments of $26.9 million were recorded on 42 Knology, ITC Holding and Magnolia Holding. Other Income decreased primarily due to an $18 million charge related to pending litigation associated with the 1999 sale of the Companys propane assets. Interest Expense Components of interest expense, excluding the debt component of AFC, were as follows: 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Millions of dollars Interest on long term debt, net $ 208.1 1.4 % $ 205.2 0.1 % $ 205.0 Other interest expense 4.3 (25.9 )% 5.8 (4.9 )% 6.1 Total $ 212.4 0.7 % $ 211.0 (0.1 )% $ 211.1 2004 vs 2003 Interest expense increased $1.4 million, primarily due to slightly higher levels of borrowing outstanding during 2004 until the payment of maturing debt late in the year. 2003 vs 2002 Interest expense remained almost flat due to an $8.5 million decrease as a result of lower interest rates (including the effect of swaps) which was partially offset by an $8.3 million increase due to additional borrowings. Income Taxes Income taxes decreased in 2004 compared to 2003 by $12.4 million and increased approximately $98.9 million in 2003 compared to 2002. Changes in income taxes are primarily due to changes in Other Income described above. The Companys effective tax rate for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was approximately 31.7%, 31.7% and 26.7%, respectively. The Companys effective tax rate has been favorably impacted in recent years by the flow through of state investment tax credits and the recovery of the equity portion of AFC. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash requirements for SCANAs regulated subsidiaries arise primarily from their operational needs, funding their construction programs and payment of dividends to SCANA. The ability of the regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant investment, as well as to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas, will depend on their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms. Regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers. Rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs. As customer growth and inflation occur and these subsidiaries continue their ongoing construction programs, rate increases will be sought. The future financial position and results of operations of the regulated subsidiaries will be affected by their ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief, if requested. In a January 2005 order the SCPSC granted SCE&G a composite increase in retail electric rates of approximately 2.89%, designed to produce additional annual revenues of approximately $41.4 million based on a test year calculation. The SCPSC lowered SCE&Gs return on common equity from 12.45% to a range of between 10.4% and 11.4%, with rates to be set at 10.7%. The new rates became effective in January 2005. As part of its order, the SCPSC approved SCE&Gs recovery of construction and operating costs for SCE&Gs new Jasper County Electric Generating Station, recovery of costs of mandatory environmental upgrades primarily related to Federal Clean Air Act regulations and the application of current and anticipated net synthetic fuel tax credits to offset the cost of constructing the back up dam at Lake Murray. The SCPSC also approved recovery over a five year period of SCE&Gs approximately $14 million of costs incurred in the formation of the GridSouth Regional Transmission 43 Organization and recovery through base rates over three years of approximately $25.6 million of purchased power costs that were previously deferred. As a part of its order, the SCPSC extended through 2010 its approval of the accelerated capital recovery plan for SCE&Gs Cope Generating Station. Under the plan, based on the level of revenues and operating expenses, SCE&G may increase depreciation of its Cope Generating Station in excess of amounts that would be recorded based upon currently approved depreciation rates, not to exceed $36 million annually, without additional approval of the SCPSC. Any unused portion of the $36 million in any given year may be carried forward for possible use in the following year. The Companys leverage ratio of debt to capital was 58% at December 31, 2004. The Companys goal is to reduce this leverage ratio to between 50% to 52%. If the agencies rating the Companys credit determine that the Company will not be able to achieve sufficient improvement in the leverage ratio, among other measures, these rating agencies may downgrade the Companys debt. Such a downgrade would adversely affect the interest rate the Company is able to obtain when issuing debt, would increase the rates applicable to the Companys short term commercial paper programs and long term debt and would limit the Companys access to capital markets. In order to bring the leverage ratio in line with rating agency expectations, the Company may apply cash flows from operations, sell equity securities, or a combination of the two. In December 2004 SCH sold its investments in two telecommunications companies. The transactions resulted in a loss of $13.9 million after taxes, but generate after tax cash proceeds of approximately $121.2 million (including cash related to certain tax benefits) which will be used to pay down debt. The Companys current estimates of its cash requirements for construction and nuclear fuel expenditures for 2005 2007, which are subject to continuing review and adjustment, are as follows: Estimated Cash Requirements 2005 2006 2007 Millions of dollars SCE&G: Electric Plant: Generation (including GENCO) $ 86 $ 145 $ 101 Transmission 44 51 27 Distribution 115 110 107 Other 15 16 17 Nuclear Fuel 23 26 25 Gas 30 30 28 Common 31 13 12 Other 4 1 Total SCE&G 348 392 317 PSNC Energy 57 62 63 Other Companies Combined 40 33 54 Total $ 445 $ 487 $ 434 44 The Companys contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2004 are summarized as follows: Contractual Cash Obligations December 31, 2004 (Millions of dollars) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Long term and short term debt (including interest and preferred stock) $ 6,303 $ 637 $ 1,068 $ 447 $ 4,151 Capital leases 2 1 1 Operating leases 56 15 33 8 Purchase obligations 166 95 63 6 2 Other commercial commitments 6,850 1,162 1,817 814 3,057 Total $ 13,377 $ 1,910 $ 2,982 $ 1,275 $ 7,210 Included in other commercial commitments are estimated obligations under forward contracts for natural gas purchases. Many of these forward contracts include customary "make whole" or default provisions, but are not considered to be "take or pay" contracts. Certain of these contracts relate to regulated businesses; therefore, the effects of such contracts on fuel costs are reflected in electric or gas rates. Also included in other commercial commitments is a 15 year "take and pay" contract for natural gas, estimated obligations for coal and nuclear fuel purchases and certain obligations related to the Lake Murray Dam reinforcement project. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Included in purchase obligations are customary purchase orders under which the Company has the option to utilize certain vendors without the obligation to do so. The Company may terminate such obligations without penalty. In addition to the contractual cash obligations above, the Company sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan and an unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plan for retirees. The pension plan is adequately funded, and no further contributions are anticipated until after 2009. Cash payments under the health care and life insurance benefit plan were approximately $11.5 million in 2004, and such payments are expected to increase to the $13 $14 million range in the future. In addition, the Company is party to certain NYMEX futures contracts for which any unfavorable market movements are funded in cash. These derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," as amended, and their effects are reflected within other comprehensive income until the anticipated sales transactions occur. The Company also has a legal obligation associated with the decommissioning and dismantling of Summer Station that is not listed in the contractual cash obligations above. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company anticipates that its contractual cash obligations will be met through internally generated funds, issuance of equity under dividend reinvestment and employee stock ownership plans, the incurrence of additional short term and long term indebtedness and other sales of equity securities. The Company expects that it has or can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet its projected cash requirements for the foreseeable future. 45 Cash outlays for 2005 (estimated) and 2004 (actual) for certain expenditures are as follows: 2005 2004 Millions of dollars Property additions and construction expenditures, net of AFC $ 422 $ 499 Nuclear fuel expenditures 23 22 Investments 18 19 Total $ 463 $ 540 Included in cash outlays are the following specific projects: FERC mandated that SCE&Gs Lake Murray Dam be reinforced to comply with new federal safety standards. Construction for the project and related activities is expected to be complete in 2005 at a cost of approximately $275 million (excluding AFC), of which approximately $240 million had been incurred through December 31, 2004. SCE&G completed construction of its 880 MW generation plant in Jasper County, South Carolina in May 2004. The plant includes three natural gas combustion turbine generators and one steam turbine generator. The total cost of the project was approximately $506 million, which includes the original construction costs for the plant itself, as well as AFC and other project related costs. All such costs have been approved for recovery in rate base. Construction of SCPCs South System Loop was completed in 2004 at a cost of approximately $21 million. This natural gas pipeline stretches 38.3 miles from SCG Pipelines connection with SCE&Gs Jasper County Electric Generating Station to Yemassee in Hampton County, South Carolina, providing a new gas supply source to SCPCs current system. Financing Limits and Related Matters The Companys issuance of various securities, including long term and short term debt, is subject to customary approval or authorization by state and federal regulatory bodies including state public service commissions and the SEC. The following describes the financing programs currently utilized by the Company. At December 31, 2004 SCANA, SCE&G (including Fuel Company) and PSNC Energy had available the following lines of credit and short term borrowings outstanding: SCANA SCE&G PSNC Energy Millions of dollars Lines of credit (total and unused): Committed Short term $ 100 Long term (expires June 2009) $ 525 $ 125 Uncommitted 113 (1) 113 (1) Short term borrowings outstanding: Commercial paper (270 or fewer days) $ 152.9 $ 57.8 Weighted average interest rate 2.40 % 2.47 % (1)Lines of credit that either SCANA or SCE&G may use. 46 SCANA Corporation SCANA has in effect a medium term note program for the issuance from time to time of unsecured medium term debt securities. While issuance of these securities requires customary approvals discussed above, the Indenture under which they are issued contains no specific limit on the amount which may be issued. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company SCE&Gs First and Refunding Mortgage Bond Indenture, dated January 1, 1945 (Old Mortgage) and covering substantially all of its properties, prohibits the issuance of additional bonds (Class A Bonds) unless net earnings (as therein defined) for 12 consecutive months out of the 18 months prior to the month of issuance are at least twice the annual interest requirements on all Class A Bonds to be outstanding (Bond Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2004 the Bond Ratio was 5.72. The Old Mortgage allows the issuance of Class A Bonds up to an additional principal amount equal to (i) 70% of unfunded net property additions (which unfunded net property additions totaled approximately $1,401.2 million at December 31, 2004), (ii) retirements of Class A Bonds (which retirement credits totaled $121.4 million at December 31, 2004), and (iii) cash on deposit with the Trustee. SCE&G is also subject to a bond indenture dated April 1, 1993 (New Mortgage) covering substantially all of its electric properties under which its future mortgage backed debt (New Bonds) will be issued. New Bonds are issued under the New Mortgage on the basis of a like principal amount of Class A Bonds issued under the Old Mortgage which have been deposited with the Trustee of the New Mortgage. At December 31, 2004 approximately $1.0 billion Class A Bonds were on deposit with the Trustee of the New Mortgage and are available to support the issuance of additional New Bonds. New Bonds will be issuable under the New Mortgage only if adjusted net earnings (as therein defined) for 12 consecutive months out of the 18 months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least twice the annual interest requirements on all outstanding bonds (including Class A Bonds) and New Bonds to be outstanding (New Bond Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2004 the New Bond Ratio was 5.57. SCE&Gs Restated Articles of Incorporation (the Articles) prohibit issuance of additional shares of preferred stock without the consent of the preferred shareholders unless net earnings (as defined therein) for the 12 consecutive months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least one and one half times the aggregate of all interest charges and preferred stock dividend requirements on all shares of preferred stock outstanding immediately after the proposed issue (Preferred Stock Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2004 the Preferred Stock Ratio was 1.71. The Articles also require the consent of a majority of the total voting power of SCE&Gs preferred stock before SCE&G may issue or assume any unsecured indebtedness if, after such issue or assumption, the total principal amount of all such unsecured indebtedness would exceed ten percent of the aggregate principal amount of all of SCE&Gs secured indebtedness and capital and surplus (the ten percent test). No such consent is required to enter into agreements for payment of principal, interest and premium for securities issued for pollution control purposes. At December 31, 2004 the ten percent test would have limited issuances of unsecured indebtedness to approximately $415.3 million. Unsecured indebtedness at December 31, 2004 totaled approximately $154.1 million, and was comprised of short term borrowings and the interest free borrowing discussed below. In 2004 SCE&G borrowed $35.4 million under an agreement with the South Carolina Transportation Infrastructure Bank (the Bank) and the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) that allows SCE&G to borrow funds from the Bank to construct a roadbed for SCDOT in connection with the Lake Murray Dam remediation project. The loan agreement provides for interest free borrowings of up to $59 million with such borrowings being repaid over ten years from the initial borrowing. At December 31, 2004 SCE&G had $32.5 million outstanding under the agreement. 47 Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated PSNC Energy has in effect a medium term note program for the issuance from time to time of unsecured medium term debt securities. While issuance of these securities requires regulatory approval, the Indenture under which they would be issued contains no specific limit on the amount which may be issued. Financing Cash Flows During 2004 the Company experienced net cash outflows related to financing activities of approximately $124 million primarily due to the reduction of long and short term debt and payment of dividends. SCE&G also experienced net cash outflows related to financing activities of approximately $110 million primarily due to the payment of dividends. The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk. These swap agreements provide for the Company to pay variable and receive fixed rate interest payments and are designated as fair value hedges of certain debt instruments. The Company may terminate a swap agreement and may replace it with a new swap also designated as a fair value hedge. Payments received upon termination of such swaps are recorded as basis adjustments to long term debt and are amortized as reductions to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. At December 31, 2004 the estimated fair value of the Companys swaps totaled $4.2 million (gain) related to combined notional amounts of $275.6 million. In anticipation of the issuance of debt, the Company may use interest rate locks or similar agreements to manage interest rate risk. Payments received or made upon termination of such agreements are recorded within other deferred debits or credits on the balance sheet and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. For additional information on significant financing transactions, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. On February 17, 2005 SCANA increased the quarterly cash dividend rate on SCANA common stock to $.39 per share, an increase of 6.8%. The new dividend is payable April 1, 2005 to stockholders of record on March 10, 2005. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Capital Expenditures In the years 2002 through 2004, the Companys capital expenditures for environmental control totaled approximately $270.4 million. These expenditures were in addition to expenditures included in "Other operation and maintenance" expenses, which were approximately $21.5 million, $29.2 million, and $29.9 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. It is not possible to estimate all future costs related to environmental matters, but forecasts for capitalized environmental expenditures for the Company are $31.7 million for 2005 and $360.4 million for the four year period 2006 through 2009. These expenditures are included in the Companys construction program, discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources, and include the matters discussed below. Electric Operations The CAA required electric utilities to substantially reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and NOx by the year 2000. The Company remains in compliance with these requirements. In 1998 the EPA required the State of South Carolina, among other states, to modify its state implementation plan (SIP) to address the issue of NOx pollution. South Carolinas SIP requires additional emissions reductions in 2004 and beyond. Further, the EPA had indicated that it would finalize regulations by March 2005 for 48 stricter limits on mercury generated by coal fired plants. Further reductions in sulfur dioxide and NOx are expected to be proposed in 2005. New legislation may also impose stringent requirements on power plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, NOx and mercury. It is also possible that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The Company cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted, and if it is, the conditions the legislation would impose on utilities. The EPA has undertaken an aggressive enforcement initiative against the utilities industry, and the DOJ has brought suit against a number of utilities in federal court alleging violations of the CAA. At least two of these suits have either been tried or have had substantive motions decided one favorable to the industry and one not. Neither is binding as precedent on the Company. Prior to the suits, those utilities had received requests for information under Section 114 of the CAA and were issued Notices of Violation. The basis for these suits is the assertion by the EPA, under a stringent rule known as New Source Review (NSR), that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities over the past 20 or more years constitute "major modifications" which would have required the installation of costly Best Available Control Technology (BACT). SCE&G and GENCO have received and responded to Section 114 requests for information related to Canadys, Wateree and Williams Stations. The regulations under the CAA provide certain exemptions to the definition of "major modifications," including an exemption for routine repair, replacement or maintenance. On October 27, 2003 EPA published a final revised NSR rule in the Federal Register with an effective date of December 26, 2003. The new rule represents an industry favorable departure from certain positions advanced by the federal government in the NSR enforcement initiative. However, on motion of several Northeastern states, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stayed the effect of the final rule. The ultimate application of the final rule to the Company is uncertain. The Company has analyzed each of the activities covered by the EPAs requests and believes each of these activities is covered by the exemption for routine repair, replacement and maintenance under what it believes is a fair reading of both the prior regulation and the contested revised regulation. The regulations also provide an exemption for an increase in emissions resulting from increased hours of operation or production rate and from demand growth. The current state of continued DOJ enforcement actions is the subject of industry wide speculation, but it is possible that the EPA will commence enforcement actions against SCE&G and GENCO, and the EPA has the authority to seek penalties at the rate of up to $27,500 per day for each violation. The EPA also could seek installation of BACT (or equivalent) at the three plants. The Company believes that any enforcement actions relative to the Companys, SCE&Gs or GENCOs compliance with the CAA would be without merit. However, if successful, such actions could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. To comply with current and anticipated state and federal regulations, SCE&G and GENCO expect to incur capital expenditures totaling approximately $193.3 million over the 2005 2008 period to retrofit existing facilities, with increased operation and maintenance costs of approximately $2.4 million per year. SCE&G and GENCO expect to have increased operation and maintenance costs of approximately $9.6 million in 2009. To meet compliance requirements for the years 2010 through 2014, the Company anticipates additional capital expenditures totaling approximately $160.1 million. The Clean Water Act, as amended, provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require treatment for wastewater discharges. Under this Act, compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program. Discharge permits have been issued for all, and renewed for nearly all, of SCE&Gs and GENCOs generating units. Concurrent with renewal of these permits, the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program of monitoring and controlling thermal discharges, has modified the requirements for cooling water intake structures, and has required strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams. The Company is developing compliance plans for these initiatives. Congress is expected to consider further amendments to the Clean Water Act. Such legislation may include limitations to mixing zones and toxicity based standards. These provisions, if passed, could have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company, SCE&G and GENCO. 49  Nuclear Fuel Disposal The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 required that the United States government, by January 31, 1998, accept and permantly dispose of high level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel and imposes a fee of 1.0 mil per KWh of net nuclear generation after April 7, 1983. The Act also imposes on utilities the primary responsibility for storage of their spent nuclear fuel until the repository is available. SCE&G entered into a Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and or High Level Radioactive Waste (Standard Contract) with the DOE in 1983 providing for permanent disposal of its spent nuclear fuel in exchange for agreed payments at particular amounts. On January 28, 2004 SCE&G and Santee Cooper (one third owner of Summer Station) filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims against the DOE for breach of the Standard Contract, because as of the date of filing, the federal government has accepted no spent fuel from Summer Station or any other utility for transport and disposal, and has indicated that it does not anticipate doing so until 2010, at the earliest. As a consequence of the federal governments breach of contract, the plaintiffs have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs. There are two additional causes of action alleged as well damages for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and a takings claim demanding just compensation for the taking of the plaintiffs real property through the cost of storage. SCE&G has on site spent nuclear fuel storage capability until at least 2018 and expects to be able to expand its storage capacity to accommodate the spent nuclear fuel output for the life of the plant through dry cask storage or other technology as it becomes available. Gas Distribution The Company maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could require environmental cleanup. As site assessments are initiated, estimates are made of the amount of expenditures, if any, deemed necessary to investigate and clean up each site. These estimates are refined as additional information becomes available; therefore, actual expenditures may differ significantly from the original estimates. Amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and cleanup relate solely to regulated operations and are recorded in deferred debits and amortized with recovery provided through rates. Deferred amounts for SCE&G, net of amounts previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements, totaled $10.5 million and $10.9 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The deferral includes the estimated costs associated with the following matters. SCE&G owns a decommissioned MGP site in the Calhoun Park area of Charleston, South Carolina. The site is currently being remediated for contamination. SCE&G anticipates that the remaining remediation activities will be completed by the end of 2005, with certain monitoring and other activities continuing until 2010. As of December 31, 2004, SCE&G has spent approximately $20.5 million to remediate the Calhoun Park site, and expects to spend an additional $1.3 million. In addition, SCE&G is party to certain claims for costs and damages from this site, for which claims the National Park Service of the Department of the Interior made an initial demand for payment of approximately $9 million. Any costs arising from these matters are expected to be recoverable through rates under South Carolina regulatory processes. SCE&G owns three other decommissioned MGP sites in South Carolina which contain residues of by product chemicals. One of the sites has been remediated and will undergo routine monitoring until released by DHEC. The other two sites are currently being investigated under work plans approved by DHEC. SCE&G anticipates that major remediation activities for the three sites will be completed in 2010. As of December 31, 2004, SCE&G has spent approximately $4 million related to these three sites, and expects to spend an additional $4 million. 50 PSNC Energy is responsible for environmental cleanup at five sites in North Carolina on which MGP residuals are present or suspected. PSNC Energys actual remediation costs for these sites will depend on a number of factors, such as actual site conditions, third party claims and recoveries from other PRPs. PSNC Energy has recorded a liability and associated regulatory asset of approximately $6.5 million, which reflects the estimated remaining liability at December 31, 2004. Amounts incurred and deferred to date, net of insurance settlements, that are not currently being recovered through gas rates are approximately $1.4 million. Management believes that all MGP cleanup costs incurred will be recoverable through gas rates. REGULATORY MATTERS Material retail rate proceedings are described in more detail in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company SCE&G is subject to the jurisdiction of the SCPSC as to retail electric and gas rates, service, accounting, issuance of securities (other than short term borrowings) and other matters. In a January 2005 order the SCPSC granted SCE&G a composite increase in retail electric rates of approximately 2.89%, designed to produce additional annual revenues of approximately $41.4 million based on a test year calculation. The SCPSC lowered SCE&Gs return on common equity from 12.45% to a range of between 10.4% and 11.4%, with rates to be set at 10.7%. The new rates became effective in January 2005. As part of its order, the SCPSC approved SCE&Gs recovery of construction and operating costs for SCE&Gs new Jasper County Electric Generating Station, recovery of costs of mandatory environmental upgrades primarily related to Federal Clean Air Act regulations and the application of current and anticipated net synthetic fuel tax credits to offset the cost of constructing the back up dam at Lake Murray. The SCPSC also approved recovery over a five year period of SCE&Gs approximately $14 million of costs incurred in the formation of the GridSouth Regional Transmission Organization and recovery through base rates over three years of approximately $25.6 million of purchased power costs that were previously deferred. As a part of its order, the SCPSC extended through 2010 its approval of the accelerated capital recovery plan for SCE&Gs Cope Generating Station. Under the plan, based on the level of revenues and operating expenses, SCE&G may increase depreciation of its Cope Generating Station in excess of amounts that would be recorded based upon currently approved depreciation rates, not to exceed $36 million annually, without additional approval of the SCPSC. Any unused portion of the $36 million in any given year may be carried forward for possible use in the following year. Synthetic Fuel Investments SCE&G holds two equity method investments in partnerships involved in converting coal to non conventional fuel, the use of which fuel qualifies for federal income tax credits. The aggregate investment in these partnerships as of December 31, 2004 is approximately $3.4 million, and through December 31, 2004, they have generated and passed through to SCE&G approximately $140.5 million in such tax credits. At December 31, 2004 SCE&G has recorded on its balance sheet $96.7 million net deferred synthetic fuel tax benefits, which includes the effects of partnership losses. In addition, Primesouth, Inc., a non regulated subsidiary of SCANA, operates a synthetic fuel facility for a third party and receives management fees, royalties and expense reimbursements related to these services. Primesouth does not benefit from any synfuel tax credits. Under a plan approved by the SCPSC, any tax credits generated by the partnerships and ultimately passed through to SCE&G from synfuel produced for and consumed by SCE&G, net of partnership 51 losses and other expenses, have been and will be deferred and will be applied to offset the capital costs of constructing the back up dam at Lake Murray. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. In March 2004, one of the partnerships, S.C. Coaltech No. l L.P., received a "No Change" letter from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to its synthetic fuel operations for the tax year 2000. After review of testing procedures and supporting documentation and conducting an independent investigation, the IRS found that the partnership produces a qualifying fuel under section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and found no reason to challenge the first placed in service status of the facility. This letter supports SCANAs position that the synthetic fuel tax credits have been properly claimed. In order to earn these tax credits, SCANA must be subject to a regular federal income tax liability in an amount at least equal to the credits generated in any taxable year. This tax liability could be insufficient if the Companys consolidated taxable income were to be significantly reduced as the result of realizing lower income or large deductions in any taxable year. Section 29 of the IRC provides for the reduction of synthetic fuel tax credits for any calendar year in which the average annual wellhead price of oil exceeds an inflation adjusted base price per barrel (as defined in the IRC, and currently estimated to be approximately $52), up to a maximum price spread (as defined in the IRC, and currently estimated to be in the range of $12 $13), at which point the credits would be completely phased out. The Company cannot predict what impact, if any, the price of oil may have on the Companys ability to earn synthetic fuel tax credits in the future. The availability of these synthetic fuel tax credits is also subject to coal availability and other operational risks related to the generating plants, including those described in the Risk Factors section within Item 1, Business. Nuclear License Extension In April 2004 the NRC approved SCE&Gs application for a 20 year license extension for its Summer Station. The extension allows the plant to operate through August 6, 2042. Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated PSNC Energy is subject to the jurisdiction of the NCUC as to gas rates, issuance of securities (other than notes with a maturity of two years or less or renewals of notes with a maturity of six years or less), accounting and other matters. As a condition to obtaining the NCUCs approval of SCANAs acquisition of PSNC Energy, PSNC Energy agreed to a moratorium on general rate increases until after August 2005. General rate relief can be obtained to recover costs associated with materially adverse governmental actions and force majeure events. The U. S. Congress passed the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (the Pipeline Safety Act), directing the U. S. Department of Transportation to establish a pipeline integrity management rule for operations of natural gas systems with transmission pipelines located near moderate to high density populations. Of PSNC Energys approximately 720 miles of transmission pipeline subject to the Pipeline Safety Act, approximately 110 miles are located within these areas. Fifty percent of these miles of pipeline must be assessed by December 2007, and the remainder by December 2012. Depending on the assessment method used, PSNC Energy will be required to reinspect these same miles of pipeline every five to seven years. Though cost estimates for this project were developed using various assumptions, each of which are subject to imprecision, PSNC Energy currently estimates the total cost to be $10 million for the initial assessments and any subsequent remediation required through December 2012. On January 21, 2005 the NCUC authorized the Company to defer for subsequent rate consideration certain expenses incurred to comply with DOTs pipeline integrity management requirements. This accounting treatment was effective November 1, 2004. 52 South Carolina Pipeline Corporation SCPC has approximately 70 miles of transmission line that are covered by the Pipeline Safety Act. Total costs for compliance with the Pipeline Safety Act have not been determined. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Following are descriptions of the Companys accounting policies which are most critical in terms of reporting financial condition or results of operations. Utility Regulation SCANAs regulated utilities are subject to the provisions of SFAS 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," which require them to record certain assets and liabilities that defer the recognition of expenses and revenues to future periods as a result of being rate regulated. In the future, as a result of deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment, the Company may no longer meet the criteria for continued application of SFAS 71 and could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the Companys Electric Distribution and Gas Distribution segments in the period the write off would be recorded. It is not expected that cash flows or financial position would be materially affected. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the Companys regulatory assets and liabilities, including those associated with the Companys environmental assessment program. The Companys generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market. If market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs, the Company could be required to write down its investment in those assets. The Company cannot predict whether any write downs will be necessary and, if they are, the extent to which they would adversely affect the Companys results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded. As of December 31, 2004 the Companys net investments in fossil/hydro and nuclear generation assets were approximately $2.5 billion and $556 million, respectively. Revenue Recognition and Unbilled Revenues Revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers of the Companys utilities and retail gas operations are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual reading of their electric and gas meters, the Company records estimates for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. Such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to each customer since the date of the last reading of their respective meters. Such unbilled revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class, the effects of different rate schedules, changes in weather and, where applicable, the impact of weather normalization provisions of rate structures. The accrual of unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of $180.5 million and $134.5 million, respectively, compared to total revenues for 2004 and 2003 of $3.9 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively. Provisions for Bad Debts and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts As of each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and records allowances for doubtful accounts based on estimates of the level of expected write offs. These estimates are based on, among other things, comparisons of the relative age of accounts, assigned credit ratings for commercial and industrial accounts, and consideration of actual write off history. The distribution segments of the Companys regulated utilities have established write off histories and 53 regulated service areas that enable the utilities to reliably estimate their respective provisions for bad debts. The Companys Retail Gas Marketing segment operates in Georgias deregulated natural gas market. As such, estimation of the provision for bad debts related to this segment is subject to greater imprecision. Nuclear Decommissioning Accounting for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future. Among the factors that could change SCE&Gs accounting estimates related to decommissioning costs are changes in technology, changes in regulatory and environmental remediation requirements, and changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and timing of cash flows. Changes in any of these estimates could significantly impact the Companys financial position and cash flows (although changes in such estimates should be earnings neutral, because these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers). SCE&Gs share of estimated site specific nuclear decommissioning costs for Summer Station, including the cost of decommissioning plant components not subject to radioactive contamination, totals approximately $357 million, stated in 1999 dollars. This estimate is based on a decommissioning study completed in 2000 and has not been updated to incorporate the 20 year license extension for Summer Station received in 2004. Santee Cooper is responsible for decommissioning costs related to its one third ownership interest in the station. The cost estimate is based on a decommissioning methodology acceptable to the NRC under which the site would be maintained over a period of approximately 60 years in such a manner as to allow for subsequent decontamination that permits release for unrestricted use. Under SCE&Gs method of funding decommissioning costs, funds collected through rates are invested in insurance policies on the lives of certain Company personnel. SCE&G is the beneficiary of these policies. Through these insurance contracts, SCE&G is able to take advantage of income tax benefits and accrue earnings on a tax deferred basis. Amounts for decommissioning collected through electric rates, insurance proceeds, and interest on proceeds, less expenses, are transferred by SCE&G to an external trust fund. Management intends for the fund, including earnings thereon, to provide for all eventual decommissioning expenditures on an after tax basis. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits SCANA follows SFAS 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," in accounting for its defined benefit pension plan. SCANAs plan is fully funded and as such, net pension income is reflected in the financial statements (see Results of Operations). SFAS 87 requires the use of several assumptions, the selection of which may have a large impact on the resulting benefit recorded. Among the more sensitive assumptions are those surrounding discount rates and returns on assets. Net pension income of $15.1 million recorded in 2004 reflects the use of a 6.0% discount rate and an assumed 9.25% long term rate of return on plan assets. SCANA believes that these assumptions were, and that the resulting pension income amount was, reasonable. For purposes of comparison, using a discount rate of 5.75% in 2004 would have increased SCANAs pension income by approximately $0.3 million. Had the assumed long term rate of return on assets been reduced to 9.0% in 2004, SCANAs pension income would have been reduced by approximately $1.9 million. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Company considers the market indices of high quality long term fixed income securities. As such, the Company selected the beginning of year discount rate of 6.0% as being within a reasonable range of interest rates for obligations rated Aa by Moodys as of January 1, 2004. This same discount rate was also selected for determination of other postemployment benefits costs discussed below. 54 The following information with respect to pension assets (and returns thereon) should also be noted: The Company determines the fair value of substantially all of its pension assets utilizing market quotes rather than utilizing any calculated values, "market related" values or other modeling techniques. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumptions, the Company evaluated input from actuaries and from pension fund investment advisors, including such advisors review of the plans historical 10, 15, 20 and 25 year cumulative actual returns of 12.1%, 11.3%, 12.5% and 12.7%, respectively, all of which have been in excess of related broad indices. The Company anticipates that the investment managers will continue to generate long term returns of at least 9.25%. The expected long term rate of return of 9.25% is based on a target asset allocation of 70% with equity managers and 30% with fixed income managers. Management regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the portfolio to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate. While investment performance in 2000 2002 and lower discount rates have significantly reduced pension income from previous or historical levels, the pension trust has been and remains adequately funded, and no contributions have been required since 1997. As such, these occurrences have had no impact on the Companys cash flows. Based on stress testing performed by the Companys actuaries, management does not anticipate the need to make pension contributions until after 2009. Similar to its pension accounting, SCANA follows SFAS 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," in accounting for its postretirement medical and life insurance benefits. This plan is unfunded, so no assumptions related to rate of return on assets impact the net expense recorded; however, the selection of discount rates can significantly impact the actuarial determination of net expense. SCANA used a discount rate of 6.0% and recorded a net SFAS 106 cost of $18.8 million for 2004. Had the selected discount rate been 5.75%, the expense for 2004 would have been approximately $0.2 million higher. Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143 provides guidance for recording and disclosing liabilities related to future legally enforceable obligations to retire assets (ARO). SFAS 143 applies to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of long lived tangible assets that result from their acquisition, construction, development and normal operation. Because such obligation relates solely to the Companys regulated electric utility, adoption of SFAS 143 had no impact on results of operations. As of January 1, 2003, the Company had recorded an ARO of approximately $111 million, which exceeded the previously recorded reserve for nuclear plant decommissioning of approximately $87 million. At December 31, 2004 such ARO totaled approximately $124 million. The Company believes that there is legal uncertainty as to the existence of environmental obligations associated with certain of its electric transmission and distribution properties. The Company believes that any ARO related to this type of property would be insignificant and, due to the indeterminate life of the related assets, an ARO could not be reasonably estimated. OTHER MATTERS Unconsolidated Special Purpose Entities Although SCANA invests in securities and business ventures, it does not hold investments in unconsolidated special purpose entities such as those described in SFAS 140, "Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities," or as described in Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities." SCANA does not engage in off balance sheet financing or similar transactions other than incidental operating leases in the normal course of business, generally for office space, furniture and equipment. 55 Claims and Litigation For a description of claims and litigation see Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All financial instruments held by the Company described below are held for purposes other than trading. Interest rate risk The tables below provide information about long term debt issued by the Company and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the figures shown reflect notional amounts and related maturities. Fair values for debt and swaps represent quoted market prices.

The above table excludes approximately $94 million and $65 million in long term debt as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which amounts do not have a stated interest rate associated with them. Commodity price risk The following tables provide information about the Companys financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in natural gas prices. Weighted average settlement prices are per 10,000 mmbtu. Fair values represent quoted market prices. 56 As of December 31, 2004 Millions of dollars, except weighted average settlement price and strike price Expected Maturity in 2005 Expected Maturity in 2006 Natural Gas Derivatives: Settlement Price(a) Contract Amount Fair Value Settlement Price(a) Contract Amount Fair Value Futures Contracts: Long($) 6.18 43.9 40.4 7.03 0.7 1.0 Short($) 6.16 2.6 2.2 Strike Price(a) Contract Amount Options: Purchased call (long)($) 7.07 65.0 As of December 31, 2003 Millions of dollars, except weighted average settlement price and strike price Expected Maturity in 2004 Expected Maturity in 2005 Expected Maturity in 2006 Natural Gas Derivatives: Settlement Price(a) Contract Amount Fair Value Settlement Price(a) Contract Amount Fair Value Settlement Price(a) Contract Amount Fair Value Futures Contracts: Long($) 5.74 41.6 46.9 5.05 3.5 4.0 5.12 0.5 0.6 Short($) 6.09 0.7 0.7 Strike Price(a) Contract Amount Options: Purchased call (long)($) 5.55 43.4 (a)weighted average The Company uses derivative instruments to hedge forward purchases and sales of natural gas, which create market risks of different types. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. The NYMEX futures information above includes those financial positions of Energy Marketing, SCPC and PSNC Energy. Certain derivatives that SCPC utilizes to hedge its gas purchasing activities are recoverable through its weighted average cost of gas calculation. SCPCs tariffs include a purchased gas adjustment (PGA) clause that provides for the recovery of actual gas costs incurred. The offset to the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded as a current asset or liability. In an October 2004 order, in connection with SCPCs 2004 annual prudency review, the SCPSC determined that SCPCs gas costs, including all hedging activities, were reasonable and prudently incurred during the 12 month review period ended December 31, 2003. PSNC Energy utilizes NYMEX futures and options to hedge gas purchasing activities. PSNC Energys tariffs also include a provision for the recovery of actual gas costs incurred. PSNC Energy records transaction fees and any realized gains or losses from derivatives acquired as part of its hedging program in deferred accounts as a regulatory asset or liability for the over or under recovery of gas costs. In a September 2004 order, in connection with PSNC Energys 2004 annual prudency review, the NCUC determined that PSNC Energys gas costs, including all hedging transactions, were reasonable and prudently incurred during the 12 month review period ended March 31, 2004. 57

The Company disclaims any obligation to update any forward looking statements. OVERVIEW SCE&G is a regulated public utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and in the purchase and sale, primarily at retail, of natural gas. SCE&Gs business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Generally, sales of electricity are higher during the summer and winter months because of air conditioning and heating requirements, and sales of natural gas are greater in the winter months due to heating requirements. SCE&Gs electric service area extends into 24 counties covering more than 15,000 square miles in the central, southern and southwestern portions of South Carolina. The service area for natural gas encompasses all or part of 34 of the 46 counties in South Carolina and covers more than 22,000 square miles. Electric Operations The electric operations segment is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, GENCO and Fuel Company, and is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in South Carolina. At December 31, 2004 SCE&G provided electricity to over 580,000 customers in an area of approximately 15,000 square miles. GENCO owns and operates a coal fired generation station and sells electricity solely to SCE&G. Fuel Company acquires, owns and provides financing for SCE&Gs nuclear fuel, fossil fuel and emission allowance requirements. Both GENCO and Fuel Company are consolidated with SCE&G for financial reporting purposes. Operating results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for electricity, the ability to control costs and rates allowed to be charged to customers. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity. The allowed return on equity for SCE&G was 12.45% in 2004. In January 2005, as a result of an electric rate case, the allowed return on equity was lowered to a range of 10.4% to 11.4%, with rates to be set at 10.7%. See further discussion at Liquidity and Capital Resources. Demand for electricity is primarily affected by weather, customer growth and the economy. 96 Legislative and regulatory initiatives also could significantly impact the results of operations and cash flows for the electric operations segment. In South Carolina the state legislature is not actively pursuing electric restructuring. However, both houses of the U.S. Congress introduced energy legislation in the 2003 2004 legislative sessions, but failed to reach a compromise on certain key issues unrelated to utilities. Energy legislation is expected to be reintroduced in 2005. It is anticipated that such legislation would include provisions that would repeal PUHCA and transfer additional regulatory authority to FERC. Provisions in the legislation would likely impose reliability standards for high voltage transmission systems. New legislation may also impose stringent requirements on power plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx) and mercury. It is also possible that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The Company cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted, and if it is, the conditions it would impose on utilities. In April 2004 the joint U.S. Canada Power System Outage Task Force issued its "Final Report on the August 14, 2003 Blackout in the United States and Canada: Causes and Recommendations" (Blackout Report). The Blackout Report contains 46 recommendations that, if implemented, the Task Force believes would improve reliability of North Americas interconnected bulk power system (the grid). Full implementation of the Blackout Reports recommendations would require a number of actions by legislative, regulatory and industry participants. However, the Blackout Report asserts as its single most important recommendation that the U.S. Congress should enact tougher reliability standards. It is anticipated that any reliability legislation, if passed, would make reliability standards mandatory and enforceable with penalties for non compliance and would strengthen the role of FERC. Regardless of the outcome of any legislative activity, FERC is expected to proceed with regulatory initiatives that, if enacted, could significantly change the countrys existing regulatory framework governing transmission, open access and energy markets and would attempt, in large measure, to standardize the national energy market and attempt to disaggregate the remaining vertically integrated utilities. In July 2002 FERC issued a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on Standard Market Design (SMD) which FERC supplemented with the issuance of a "white paper" in April 2003. If implemented, the proposed rule could have a significant impact on SCE&Gs access to or cost of power for its native load customers and on SCE&Gs marketing of power outside its service territory. The Company is currently evaluating FERCs action to determine potential effects on SCE&Gs operations. Additional directives from FERC are expected. The North American Electric Reliability Council (NERC) also is expected to continue its initiatives to develop, establish and enforce additional standards for the grid. To that end, NERC is working closely with FERC to implement stronger reliability standards among NERCs voluntary membership. SCE&G, along with other NERC members, is also working closely with NERC in these efforts. Such initiatives could be significantly influenced by any reliability legislation enacted by Congress. The Company cannot predict whether Congress will enact reliability legislation or the extent to which the other recommendations contained in the Blackout Report will be implemented. Any action by Congress or initiatives by FERC or NERC could significantly impact SCE&Gs access to or cost of power for its native load customers and SCE&Gs marketing of power outside its service territory. Gas Distribution The gas distribution segment is comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G and is primarily engaged in the purchase and sale, primarily at retail, of natural gas in portions of South Carolina. At December 31, 2004 this segment provided natural gas to approximately 282,000 customers. Operating results for gas distribution are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas, the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity, which in 2004 was 12.25%. Demand for natural gas is primarily affected by weather, customer growth, the economy and, for commercial and 97 industrial customers, the availability and price of alternate fuels. Natural gas competes with electricity, propane and heating oil to serve the heating and, to a lesser extent, other household energy needs of residential and small commercial customers. This competition is generally based on price and convenience. Large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel, such as propane or fuel oil. Natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price. As a result, any significant disparity between supply and demand, either of natural gas or of alternate fuels, and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors, will affect price and impact SCE&Gs ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Income Net income and the percent change from the previous year for the years 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Millions of dollars Net income $ 232.5 $ 220.5 $ 219.6 Percent increase (decrease) in net income 5.5 % 0.4 % (1.0 )% 2004 vs 2003 Net income increased primarily due to higher electric margins of $62.2 million, partially offset by lower gas margins of $4.6 million, increased operations and maintenance expenses of $17.4 million, higher depreciation and amortization expense of $15.3 million, higher taxes other than income of $3.3 million and lower AFC of $3.5 million. 2003 vs 2002 Net income increased slightly primarily due to higher electric margins of $36.8 million, higher gas margins of $2.6 million, reduction of preferred dividend requirements of $0.9 million and other of $1.3 million, partially offset by higher operations and maintenance expenses of $15.9 million (including $7.1 due to lower pension income), higher depreciation and amortization expense of $10.9 million, higher property taxes of $7.2 million and higher interest expense of $6.7 million. Pension Income Pension income was recorded on SCE&Gs financial statements as follows: 2004 2003 2002 Millions of dollars Income Statement Impact: (Component of) reduction in employee benefit costs $ 4.2 $ (1.0 ) $ 10.5 Other income 11.0 8.2 11.2 Balance Sheet Impact: (Component of) reduction in capital expenditures 1.2 (0.3 ) 3.1 Component of (reduction in) amount due to Summer Station co owner 0.4 (0.1 ) 0.7 Total Pension Income $ 16.8 $ 6.8 $ 25.5 For the last several years, the market value of SCE&Gs retirement plan (pension) assets has exceeded the total actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits. Pension incomes sharp decline 98 in 2003 and its increase in 2004 are consistent with overall investment market results. See also the discussion of pension accounting in Critical Accounting Estimates. Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFC) AFC is a utility accounting practice whereby a portion of the cost of both equity and borrowed funds used to finance construction (which is shown on the balance sheet as construction work in progress) is capitalized. The Company includes an equity portion of AFC in nonoperating income and a debt portion of AFC in interest charges (credits) as noncash items, both of which have the effect of increasing reported net income. AFC represented approximately 6.7% of income before income taxes in 2004, 8.6% in 2003 and 9.2% in 2002. The decrease in AFC for 2004 vs 2003 is primarily due to completion of the Jasper County Electric Generating Station in May 2004. The decrease in AFC for 2003 vs 2002 is primarily the result of the completion of the Urquhart Station repowering project in June 2002. In addition, in January 2003 the SCPSC issued an order allowing SCE&G to include all Jasper County generating project expenditures as of December 31, 2002 and other construction work in progress expenditures as of June 30, 2002 in its electric rate base. At the time the expenditures were included in the rate base, AFC was no longer calculated on those amounts. These decreases were partially offset by increased AFC from subsequent construction expenditures related to the Jasper County generating and Lake Murray Dam projects (see discussion at CAPITAL PROJECTS). Dividends Declared SCE&Gs Board of Directors has declared the following dividends on common stock held by SCANA during 2004: Declaration Date Dividend Amount Quarter Ended Payment Date February 19, 2004 $ 36.0 million March 31, 2004 April 1, 2004 April 29, 2004 $ 37.0 million June 30, 2004 July 1, 2004 July 29, 2004 $ 36.0 million September 30, 2004 October 1, 2004 October 29, 2004 $ 36.5 million December 31, 2004 January 1, 2005 Electric Operations Electric Operations is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, GENCO and Fuel Company. Electric operations sales margins for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Millions of dollars Operating revenues $ 1,692.0 15.0 % $ 1,471.7 6.3 % $ 1,384.8 Less: Fuel used in generation 466.9 39.8 % 334.1 1.4 % 329.6 Purchased power 50.7 (20.8 )% 64.0 52.0 % 42.1 Margin $ 1,174.4 9.4 % $ 1,073.6 6.0 % $ 1,013.1 99 2004 vs 2003 Margin increased primarily due to increased off system sales of $47.2 million, increased customer growth and consumption of $22.9 million, $22.3 million due to favorable weather and $7.1 million due to the increase in retail electric base rates effective February 2003. Fuel used in generation increased approximately $103.0 million due to increased availability of generation facilities and approximately $30.0 million due to increased cost of coal. Purchased power decreased due to greater availability of generation facilities. 2003 vs 2002 Margin increased primarily due to the increase in retail electric base rates effective February 2003 totaling $63.6 million and customer growth and increased consumption of $24.3 million, partially offset by $27.3 million due to less favorable weather. Fuel used in generation increased by $9.3 million due to the increased cost of natural gas and fuel oil for the Urquhart combined cycle gas turbines and by $1.1 million due to the increased cost of nuclear fuel, partially offset by $5.5 million due to planned plant outages throughout the year. Purchased power increased due to planned plant outages throughout the year. MWh sales volumes by classes, related to the electric margin above, were as follows: Classification (in thousands) 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Residential 7,460 6.6 % 6,998 (3.2 )% 7,230 Commercial 6,919 4.5 % 6,622 (0.5 )% 6,658 Industrial 6,775 3.5 % 6,548 0.7 % 6,505 Sales for resale (excluding interchange) 2,472 71.9 % 1,438 (0.7 )% 1,448 Other 526 5.2 % 500 (6.5 )% 535 Total territorial 24,152 9.3 % 22,106 (1.2 )% 22,376 NMST 898 * 425 (40.0 )% 709 Total 25,050 11.2 % 22,531 (2.4 )% 23,085 *Greater than 100% 2004 vs 2003 Territorial sales volumes increased primarily due to more favorable weather, customer growth and consumption and increased off system sales. NMST volumes increased primarily due to increased availability of generating plants that increased volumes available for resale. 2003 vs 2002 Territorial sales volume decreased primarily due to less favorable weather. NMST volumes decreased primarily due to planned outages at generation plants that reduced volumes available for resale. 100 Gas Distribution Gas Distribution is comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G. Gas distribution sales margins (including transactions with affiliates) for 2004, 2003 and 2002 were as follows: 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Millions of dollars Operating revenues $ 397.4 10.4 % $ 360.1 20.8 % $ 298.2 Less: Gas purchased for resale 313.6 16.7 % 268.8 27.3 % 211.1 Margin $ 83.8 (8.2 )% $ 91.3 4.8 % $ 87.1 2004 vs 2003 Margin decreased primarily due to a decreased billing surcharge for the recovery of environmental remediation expenses of $5.0 million and lower residential and commercial sales volumes of $2.5 million. 2003 vs 2002 Margin increased primarily due to customer growth and increased consumption totaling $7.2 million, partially offset by a decrease in industrial usage of $3.0 million primarily due to an unfavorable competitive position of natural gas relative to alternate fuels. DT sales volumes by classes, including transportation gas were as follows: Classification (in thousands) 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Residential 12,916 (2.5 )% 13,243 8.2 % 12,242 Commercial 12,155 (1.4 )% 12,322 5.2 % 11,718 Industrial 15,087 3.9 % 14,524 (11.5 )% 16,419 Transportation gas 2,272 6.1 % 2,141 (9.8 )% 2,373 Total 42,430 0.5 % 42,230 (1.2 )% 42,752 2004 vs 2003 Residential and commercial sales volumes decreased primarily due to unfavorable consumption patterns. Industrial and transportation volumes increased in 2004 primarily as a result of interruptible customers using gas instead of alternative fuels. 2003 vs 2002 Residential and commercial sales volumes increased primarily due to more favorable weather. Industrial and transportation volumes decreased in 2003 primarily as a result of interruptible customers using their alternate fuel sources during the year. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses were as follows: 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Millions of dollars Other operation and maintenance $ 431.0 6.9 % $ 403.0 7.1 % $ 376.2 Depreciation and amortization 220.9 12.6 % 196.2 10.0 % 178.4 Other taxes 131.4 4.3 % 126.0 10.1 % 114.4 Total $ 783.3 8.0 % $ 725.2 8.4 % $ 669.0 101 2004 vs 2003 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to increased labor and benefit expense of $19.5 million, $11.0 million of increased operating expenses at the electric generation plants and $2.5 million of expenses associated with winter storm restoration, partially offset by increased pension income of $5.2 million. Depreciation and amortization increased by $13.4 million due to completion of the Jasper County Electric Generating Station and $11.1 million attributed to normal additions. Other taxes increased primarily due to property taxes. 2003 vs 2002 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to lower pension income of $11.5 million, increased labor and benefit costs of $9.8 million, and increased nuclear operating expenses of $4.5 million. Depreciation and amortization increased by $10.7 million due to normal net property increases, by $4.2 million due to the completion of the Urquhart Station repowering project in June 2002 and by $2.7 million due to amortization of franchise fees. Other taxes increased primarily due to increased property taxes. Interest Expense Components of interest expense, excluding the debt component of AFC, were as follows: 2004 % Change 2003 % Change 2002 Millions of dollars Interest on long term debt, net $ 144.8 3.7 % $ 139.7 9.5 % $ 127.6 Other interest expense 3.5 (52.1 )% 7.3 7.3 Total $ 148.3 0.9 % $ 147.0 9.0 % $ 134.9 2004 vs 2003 Interest on long term debt increased $5.1 million, primarily due to slightly higher levels of borrowing outstanding during 2004 until the payment of maturing debt late in the year. 2003 vs 2002 Interest expense increased by $10.9 million, primarily due to a $22.0 million increase from additional borrowings, which was partially offset by $10.2 million as a result of lower interest rates. Income Taxes Income taxes increased approximately $10.1 million for the year 2004 compared to 2003 and decreased approximately $5.2 million for the year 2003 compared to 2002. The Companys effective tax rate for 2004, 2003 and 2002 was approximately 34.0%, 33.1% and 34.3%, respectively. Changes in income taxes are primarily due to changes in operating income. SCE&Gs effective tax rate has also been favorably impacted in recent years by the flow through of state investment tax credits and the recovery of the equity portion of AFC. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companys cash requirements arise primarily from its operational needs, funding its construction program and payment of dividends to SCANA. The ability of the Company to replace existing plant investment, as well as to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas, will depend upon its ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms. SCE&G recovers the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers. Rates for regulated services are 102 generally based on historical costs. As customer growth and inflation occur and SCE&G continues its ongoing construction program, SCE&G expects to seek increases in rates. The Companys future financial position and results of operations will be affected by SCE&Gs ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief, if requested. In a January 2005 order the SCPSC granted SCE&G a composite increase in retail electric rates of approximately 2.89%, designed to produce additional annual revenues of approximately $41.4 million based on a test year calculation. The SCPSC lowered SCE&Gs return on common equity from 12.45% to a range of between 10.4% and 11.4%, with rates to be set at 10.7%. The new rates became effective in January 2005. As part of its order, the SCPSC approved SCE&Gs recovery of construction and operating costs for SCE&Gs new Jasper County Electric Generating Station, recovery of costs of mandatory environmental upgrades primarily related to Federal Clean Air Act regulations and the application of current and anticipated net synthetic fuel tax credits to offset the cost of constructing the back up dam at Lake Murray. The SCPSC also approved recovery of SCE&Gs approximately $14 million of costs incurred in the formation of the GridSouth Regional Transmission Organization over a five year period, and recovery through base rates over three years of approximately $25.6 million of purchased power costs that were previously deferred. As a part of its order, the SCPSC extended through 2010 its approval of the accelerated capital recovery plan for SCE&Gs Cope Generating Station. Under the plan, based on the level of revenues and operating expenses, SCE&G may increase depreciation of its Cope Generating Station in excess of amounts that would be recorded based upon currently approved depreciation rates, not to exceed $36 million annually, without additional approval of the SCPSC. Any unused portion of the $36 million in any given year may be carried forward for possible use in the following year. The Companys current estimates of its cash requirements for construction and nuclear fuel expenditures for 2005 2007, which are subject to continuing review and adjustment, are as follows: Estimated Cash Requirements 2005 2006 2007 Millions of dollars SCE&G: Electric Plant: Generation (including GENCO) $ 86 $ 145 $ 101 Transmission 44 51 27 Distribution 115 110 107 Other 15 16 17 Nuclear Fuel 23 26 25 Gas 30 30 28 Common 31 13 12 Other 4 1 Total SCE&G $ 348 $ 392 $ 317 103 The Companys contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2004 are summarized as follows: Contractual Cash Obligations December 31, 2004 (Millions of dollars) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Long term and short term debt (including interest and preferred stock) $ 4,501 $ 448 $ 527 $ 329 $ 3,197 Capital leases 1 1 Operating leases 48 12 29 7 Purchase obligations 91 61 28 2 Other commercial commitments 765 311 443 1 10 Total $ 5,406 $ 833 $ 1,027 $ 337 $ 3,209 Included in other commercial commitments are estimated obligations for coal and nuclear fuel purchases and certain obligations related to the Lake Murray Dam reinforcement project. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Included in purchase obligations are customary purchase orders under which SCE&G has the option to utilize certain vendors without the obligation to do so. SCE&G may terminate such obligations without penalty. The Company also has a legal obligation associated with the decommissioning and dismantling of Summer Station that is not listed in the contractual cash obligations above. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company anticipates that its contractual cash obligations will be met through internally generated funds and the incurrence of additional short term and long term indebtedness. The Company expects that it has or can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet its projected cash requirements for the foreseeable future. Cash outlays for 2005 (estimated) and 2004 (actual) for certain expenditures are as follows: 2005 2004 Millions of dollars Property additions and construction expenditures, net of AFC $ 325 $ 422 Nuclear fuel expenditures 23 22 Investments 18 19 Total $ 366 $ 463 Included in cash outlays are the following specific projects: FERC mandated that SCE&Gs Lake Murray Dam be reinforced to comply with new federal safety standards. Construction for the project and related activities is expected to be complete in 2005 at a cost of approximately $275 million (excluding AFC), of which approximately $240 million had been incurred through December 31, 2004. SCE&G completed construction on its 880 MW generation plant in Jasper County, South Carolina in May 2004. The plant includes three natural gas combustion turbine generators and one steam turbine generator. The total cost of the project was approximately $506 million, which includes the original construction costs for the plant itself, as well as AFC and other project related costs. All such costs have been approved for recovery in rate base. 104  Financing Limits and Related Matters The Companys issuance of various securities, including long term and short term debt, is subject to customary approval or authorization by state and federal regulatory bodies including the SCPSC and the SEC. The following describes the financing programs currently utilized by the Company. At December 31, 2004 SCE&G and Fuel Company had available the following lines of credit and short term borrowings outstanding: Millions of dollars Lines of credit (total and unused): SCE&G and Fuel Company Committed (expires June 2009) $ 525 Uncommitted 113 (1) Short term borrowings outstanding: Commercial paper (270 or fewer days) $ 152.9 Weighted average interest rate 2.40 % (1)Lines of credit that either the Company or SCANA may use. SCE&Gs First and Refunding Mortgage Bond Indenture, dated January 1, 1945 (Old Mortgage) and covering substantially all of its properties, prohibits the issuance of additional bonds (Class A Bonds) unless net earnings (as therein defined) for 12 consecutive months out of the 18 months prior to the month of issuance are at least twice the annual interest requirements on all Class A Bonds to be outstanding (Bond Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2004 the Bond Ratio was 5.72. The Old Mortgage allows the issuance of Class A Bonds up to an additional principal amount equal to (i) 70% of unfunded net property additions (which unfunded net property additions totaled approximately $1,401.2 million at December 31, 2004), (ii) retirements of Class A Bonds (which retirement credits totaled $121.4 million at December 31, 2004), and (iii) cash on deposit with the Trustee. SCE&G is also subject to a bond indenture dated April 1, 1993 (New Mortgage) covering substantially all of its electric properties under which its future mortgage backed debt (New Bonds) will be issued. New Bonds are issued under the New Mortgage on the basis of a like principal amount of Class A Bonds issued under the Old Mortgage which have been deposited with the Trustee of the New Mortgage. At December 31, 2004 approximately $1.0 billion Class A Bonds were on deposit with the Trustee of the New Mortgage and are available to support the issuance of additional New Bonds. New Bonds will be issuable under the New Mortgage only if adjusted net earnings (as therein defined) for 12 consecutive months out of the 18 months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least twice the annual interest requirements on all outstanding bonds (including Class A Bonds) and New Bonds to be outstanding (New Bond Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2004 the New Bond Ratio was 5.57. SCE&Gs Restated Articles of Incorporation (the Articles) prohibit issuance of additional shares of preferred stock without the consent of the preferred shareholders unless net earnings (as defined therein) for the 12 consecutive months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least one and one half times the aggregate of all interest charges and preferred stock dividend requirements on all shares of preferred stock outstanding immediately after the proposed issue (Preferred Stock Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2004 the Preferred Stock Ratio was 1.71. The Articles also require the consent of a majority of the total voting power of SCE&Gs preferred stock before SCE&G may issue or assume any unsecured indebtedness if, after such issue or assumption, the total principal amount of all such unsecured indebtedness would exceed ten percent of the aggregate principal amount of all of SCE&Gs secured indebtedness and capital and surplus (the 105 ten percent test). No such consent is required to enter into agreements for payment of principal, interest and premium for securities issued for pollution control purposes. At December 31, 2004 the ten percent test would have limited issuances of unsecured indebtedness to approximately $415.3 million. Unsecured indebtedness at December 31, 2004 totaled approximately $154.1 million, and was comprised of short term borrowings and the interest free borrowing discussed below. In 2004 SCE&G borrowed $35.4 million under an agreement with the South Carolina Transportation Infrastructure Bank (the Bank) and the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) that allows SCE&G to borrow funds from the Bank to construct a roadbed for SCDOT in connection with the Lake Murray Dam remediation project. The loan agreement provides for interest free borrowings of up to $59 million with such borrowings being repaid over ten years from the initial borrowing. At December 31, 2004 SCE&G had $32.5 million outstanding under the agreement. Financing Cash Flows During 2004 the Company experienced net cash outflows related to financing activities of approximately $110 million primarily due to the payment of dividends. In anticipation of the issuance of debt, the Company may use interest rate lock or similar agreements to manage interest rate risk. Payments received or made upon termination of such agreements are recorded within other deferred debits or credits on the balance sheet and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. For additional information on significant financing transactions, see Note 4 to the Companys consolidated financial statements. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Capital Expenditures In the years 2002 through 2004, the Companys capital expenditures for environmental control totaled approximately $269.3 million. These expenditures were in addition to expenditures included in "Other operation and maintenance" expenses, which were approximately $21.3 million, $29.0 million, and $29.7 million during 2004, 2003 and 2002, respectively. It is not possible to estimate all future costs related to environmental matters, but forecasts for capitalized environmental expenditures for the Company are $31.6 million for 2005 and $360.1 million for the four year period 2006 through 2009. These expenditures are included in the Companys construction program discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources, and include the matters discussed below. Electric Operations The CAA required electric utilities to substantially reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide and NOx by the year 2000. The Company remains in compliance with these requirements. In 1998 the EPA required the State of South Carolina, among other states, to modify its state implementation plan (SIP) to address the issue of NOx pollution. South Carolinas SIP requires additional emissions reductions in 2004 and beyond. Further, the EPA had indicated that it would finalize regulations by March 2005 for stricter limits on mercury generated by coal fired plants. Further reductions in sulfur dioxide and NOx are expected to be proposed in 2005. New legislation may also impose stringent requirements on power plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, NOx and mercury. It is also possible that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The Company cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted, and if it is, the conditions the legislation would impose on utilities. The EPA has undertaken an aggressive enforcement initiative against the utilities industry, and the DOJ has brought suit against a number of utilities in federal court alleging violations of the CAA. At least two of these suits have either been tried or have had substantive motions decided one favorable 106 to the industry and one not. Neither is binding as precedent on the Company. Prior to the suits, those utilities had received requests for information under Section 114 of the CAA and were issued Notices of Violation. The basis for these suits is the assertion by the EPA, under a stringent rule known as New Source Review (NSR), that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities over the past 20 or more years constitute "major modifications" which would have required the installation of costly Best Available Control Technology (BACT). SCE&G and GENCO have received and responded to Section 114 requests for information related to Canadys, Wateree and Williams Stations. The regulations under the CAA provide certain exemptions to the definition of "major modifications," including an exemption for routine repair, replacement or maintenance. On October 27, 2003 EPA published a final revised NSR rule in the Federal Register with an effective date of December 26, 2003. The new rule represents an industry favorable departure from certain positions advanced by the federal government in the NSR enforcement initiative. However, on motion of several Northeastern states, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stayed the effect of the final rule. The ultimate application of the final rule to the Company is uncertain. The Company has analyzed each of the activities covered by the EPAs requests and believes each of these activities is covered by the exemption for routine repair, replacement and maintenance under what it believes is a fair reading of both the prior regulation and the contested revised regulation. The regulations also provide an exemption for an increase in emissions resulting from increased hours of operation or production rate and from demand growth. The current state of continued DOJ enforcement actions is the subject of industry wide speculation, but it is possible that the EPA will commence enforcement actions against SCE&G and GENCO, and the EPA has the authority to seek penalties at the rate of up to $27,500 per day for each violation. The EPA also could seek installation of BACT (or equivalent) at the three plants. The Company believes that any enforcement actions relative to the Companys compliance with the CAA would be without merit. However, if successful, such actions could have a material adverse effect on the Companys financial condition, cash flows and results of operations. To comply with current and anticipated state and federal regulations, SCE&G and GENCO expect to incur capital expenditures totaling approximately $193.3 million over the 2005 2008 period to retrofit existing facilities, with increased operation and maintenance costs of approximately $2.4 million per year. SCE&G and GENCO expect to have increased operation and maintenance costs of approximately $9.6 million in 2009. To meet compliance requirements for the years 2010 through 2014, the Company anticipates additional capital expenditures totaling approximately $160.1 million. The Clean Water Act, as amended, provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require treatment for wastewater discharges. Under this Act, compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program. Discharge permits have been issued for all, and renewed for nearly all, of SCE&Gs and GENCOs generating units. Concurrent with renewal of these permits, the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program of monitoring and controlling thermal discharges, has modified the requirements for cooling water intake structures, and has required strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams. The Company is developing compliance plans for these initiatives. Congress is expected to consider further amendments to the Clean Water Act. Such legislation may include limitations to mixing zones and toxicity based standards. These provisions, if passed, could have a material impact on the financial condition and results of operations and cash flows of the Company. Nuclear Fuel Disposal The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 required that the United States government, by January 31, 1998, accept and permantly dispose of high level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel and imposes a fee of 1.0 mil per KWh of net nuclear generation after April 7, 1983. The Act also imposes on utilities the primary responsibility for storage of their spent nuclear fuel until the repository is available. SCE&G entered into a Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and or High Level Radioactive Waste (Standard Contract) with the DOE in 1983 providing for permanent disposal of its 107 spent nuclear fuel in exchange for agreed payments at particular amounts. On January 28, 2004 SCE&G and Santee Cooper (one third owner of Summer Station) filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims against the DOE for breach of the Standard Contract, because as of the date of filing, the federal government has accepted no spent fuel from Summer Station or any other utility for transport and disposal, and has indicated that it does not anticipate doing so until 2010, at the earliest. As a consequence of the federal governments breach of contract, the plaintiffs have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs. There are two additional causes of action alleged as well damages for breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and a takings claim demanding just compensation for the taking of the plaintiffs real property through the cost of storage. SCE&G has on site spent nuclear fuel storage capability until at least 2018 and expects to be able to expand its storage capacity to accommodate the spent nuclear fuel output for the life of the plant through dry cask storage or other technology as it becomes available. Gas Distribution The Company maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could require environmental cleanup. As site assessments are initiated, estimates are made of the amount of expenditures, if any, deemed necessary to investigate and clean up each site. These estimates are refined as additional information becomes available; therefore, actual expenditures may differ significantly from the original estimates. Amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and cleanup relate solely to regulated operations and are recorded in deferred debits and amortized with recovery provided through rates. Deferred amounts, net of amounts previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements, totaled $10.5 million and $10.9 million at December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively. The deferral includes the estimated costs associated with the following matters: SCE&G owns a decommissioned MGP site in the Calhoun Park area of Charleston, South Carolina. The site is currently being remediated for contamination. SCE&G anticipates that the remaining remediation activities will be completed by the end of 2005, with certain monitoring and other activities continuing until 2010. As of December 31, 2004, SCE&G has spent approximately $20.5 million to remediate the Calhoun Park site, and expects to spend an additional $1.3 million. In addition, SCE&G is party to certain claims for costs and damages from this site, for which claims the National Park Service of the Department of the Interior made an initial demand for payment of approximately $9 million. Any costs arising from these matters are expected to be recoverable through rates under South Carolina regulatory processes. SCE&G owns three other decommissioned MGP sites in South Carolina which contain residues of by product chemicals. One of the sites has been remediated and will undergo routine monitoring until released by DHEC. The other two sites are currently being investigated under work plans approved by DHEC. SCE&G anticipates that major remediation activities for the three sites will be completed in 2010. As of December 31, 2004, SCE&G has spent approximately $4 million related to these three sites, and expects to spend an additional $4 million. REGULATORY MATTERS The Company is subject to the jurisdiction of the SCPSC as to retail electric and gas rates, service, accounting, issuance of securities (other than short term borrowings) and other matters. Material retail rate proceedings are described in more detail in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. In a January 2005 order the SCPSC granted SCE&G a composite increase in retail electric rates of approximately 2.89%, designed to produce additional annual revenues of approximately $41.4 million based on a test year calculation. The SCPSC lowered SCE&Gs return on common equity from 12.45% 108 to a range of between 10.4% and 11.4%, with rates to be set at 10.7%. The new rates became effective in January 2005. As part of its order, the SCPSC approved the Companys recovery of construction and operating costs for the Companys new Jasper County Electric Generating Station, recovery of costs of mandatory environmental upgrades primarily related to Federal Clean Air Act regulations and the application of current and anticipated net synthetic fuel tax credits to offset the cost of constructing the back up dam at Lake Murray. The SCPSC also approved recovery over a five year period of the Companys approximately $14 million of costs incurred in the formation of the GridSouth Regional Transmission Organization and recovery through base rates over three years of approximately $25.6 million of purchased power costs that were previously deferred. As a part of its order, the SCPSC extended through 2010 its approval of the accelerated capital recovery plan for SCE&Gs Cope Generating Station. Under the plan, based on the level of revenues and operating expenses, SCE&G may increase depreciation of its Cope Generating Station in excess of amounts that would be recorded based upon currently approved depreciation rates, not to exceed $36 million annually, without additional approval of the SCPSC. Any unused portion of the $36 million in any given year may be carried forward for possible use in the following year. Synthetic Fuel Investments SCE&G holds two equity method investments in partnerships involved in converting coal to non conventional fuel, the use of which fuel qualifies for federal income tax credits. The aggregate investment in these partnerships as of December 31, 2004 is approximately $3.4 million, and through December 31, 2004, they have generated and passed through to SCE&G approximately $140.5 million in such tax credits. At December 31, 2004 SCE&G has recorded on its balance sheet $96.7 million net deferred fuel tax benefits, which includes the effects of partnership losses. Under a plan approved by the SCPSC, any tax credits generated by the partnerships and ultimately passed through to SCE&G from synfuel produced for and consumed by SCE&G, net of partnership losses and other expenses, have been and will be deferred and will be applied to offset the capital costs of constructing the back up dam at Lake Murray. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. In March 2004, one of the partnerships, S.C. Coaltech No. l L.P., received a "No Change" letter from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) related to its synthetic fuel operations for the tax year 2000. After review of testing procedures and supporting documentation and conducting an independent investigation, the IRS found that the partnership produces a qualifying fuel under section 29 of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC) and found no reason to challenge the first placed in service status of the facility. This letter supports the Companys position that the synthetic fuel tax credits have been properly claimed. In order to earn these tax credits SCANA must be subject to a regular federal income tax liability in an amount at least equal to the credits generated in any taxable year. This tax liability could be insufficient if SCANAs consolidated taxable income were to be significantly reduced as the result of realizing lower income or large deductions in any taxable year. Section 29 of the IRC provides for the reduction of synthetic fuel tax credits for any calendar year in which the average annual wellhead price of oil exceeds an inflation adjusted base price per barrel (as defined in the IRC, and currently estimated to be approximately $52), up to a maximum price spread (as defined in the IRC, and currently estimated to be in the range of $12 $13), at which point the credits would be completely phased out. The Company cannot predict what impact, if any, the price of oil may have on the Companys ability to earn synthetic fuel tax credits in the future. The availability of these synthetic fuel tax credits is also subject to coal availability and other operational risks related to the generating plants, including those described in the Risk Factors section within Item 1, Business. 109 Nuclear License Extension In April 2004 the NRC approved SCE&Gs application with the NRC for a 20 year license extension for its Summer Station. The extension allows the plant to operate through August 6, 2042. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Following are descriptions of the Companys accounting policies which are new or most critical in terms of reporting financial condition or results of operations. Utility Regulation The Company is subject to the provisions of SFAS 71, "Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation," which requires it to record certain assets and liabilities that defer the recognition of expenses and revenues to future periods as a result of being rate regulated. In the future, as a result of deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment, the Company may no longer meet the criteria for continued application of SFAS 71 and could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the Companys Electric Distribution and Gas Distribution segments in the period the write off would be recorded. It is not expected that cash flows or financial position would be materially affected. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the Companys regulatory assets and liabilities, including those associated with the Companys environmental assessment program. The Companys generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market. If market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs, the Company could be required to write down its investment in those assets. The Company cannot predict whether any write downs will be necessary and, if they are, the extent to which they would adversely affect the Companys results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded. As of December 31, 2004 the Companys net investments in fossil/hydro and nuclear generation assets were approximately $2.5 billion and $556 million, respectively. Revenue Recognition and Unbilled Revenues Revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual reading of their electric and gas meters, the Company records estimates for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. Such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to each customer since the date of the last reading of their respective meters. Such unbilled revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class, the effects of different rate schedules, changes in weather and, where applicable, the impact of weather normalization provisions of rate structures. The accrual of unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs. As of December 31, 2004 and 2003, accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of $48.1 million and $50.0 million, respectively, compared to total revenues for 2004 and 2003 of $2.1 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. Nuclear Decommissioning Accounting for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future. Among the factors that could change the Companys accounting estimates related to decommissioning costs are changes in technology, changes in regulatory and environmental remediation requirements, as well as changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and timing of cash flows. Changes in any of these estimates could significantly 110 impact the Companys financial position and cash flows (although changes in such estimates should be earnings neutral, because these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers). The Companys share of estimated site specific nuclear decommissioning costs for Summer Station, including the cost of decommissioning plant components not subject to radioactive contamination, totals approximately $357 million, stated in 1999 dollars. This estimate is based on a decommissioning study completed in 2000 and has not been updated to incorporate the 20 year license extension for Summer Station received in 2004. Santee Cooper is responsible for decommissioning costs related to its one third ownership interest in the station. The cost estimate is based on a decommissioning methodology acceptable to the NRC under which the site would be maintained over a period of approximately 60 years in such a manner as to allow for subsequent decontamination that permits release for unrestricted use. Under the Companys method of funding decommissioning costs, funds collected through rates are invested in insurance policies on the lives of certain Company and affiliate personnel. SCE&G is the beneficiary of these policies. Through these insurance contracts, SCE&G is able to take advantage of income tax benefits and accrue earnings on the fund on a tax deferred basis. Amounts for decommissioning collected through electric rates, insurance proceeds, and interest on proceeds, less expenses, are transferred by SCE&G to an external trust fund. Management intends for the fund, including earnings thereon, to provide for all eventual decommissioning expenditures on an after tax basis. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Company follows SFAS 87, "Employers Accounting for Pensions," in accounting for its defined benefit pension plan. The Companys plan is fully funded and as such, net pension income is reflected in the financial statements (see Results of Operations). SFAS 87 requires the use of several assumptions, the selection of which may have a large impact on the resulting benefit recorded. Among the more sensitive assumptions are those surrounding discount rates and returns on assets. Net pension income of $16.8 million recorded in 2004 reflects the use of a 6.0% discount rate and an assumed 9.25% long term rate of return on plan assets. The Company believes that these assumptions were, and that the resulting pension income amount was, reasonable. For purposes of comparison, using a discount rate of 5.75% in 2004 would have increased the Companys pension income approximately $0.3 million. Had the assumed long term rate of return on assets been reduced to 9.0% in 2004, the Companys pension income would have been reduced by approximately $1.8 million. In determining the appropriate discount rate, the Company considers the market indices of high quality long term fixed income securities. As such, the Company selected the beginning of year discount rate of 6.0% as being within a reasonable range of interest rates for obligations rated Aa by Moodys as of January 1, 2004. This same discount rate was also selected for determination of other postemployment benefits costs discussed below. The following information with respect to pension assets (and returns thereon) should also be noted: The Company determines the fair value of substantially all of its pension assets utilizing market quotes rather than utilizing any calculated values, "market related" values or other modeling techniques. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumptions, the Company evaluated input from actuaries and from pension fund investment advisors, including such advisors review of the plans historical 10, 15, 20 and 25 year cumulative actual returns of 12.1%, 11.3%, 12.5% and 12.7%, respectively, all of which have been in excess of related broad indices. The Company anticipates that the investment managers will continue to generate long term returns of at least 9.25%. 111 The expected long term rate of return of 9.25% is based on a target asset allocation of 70% with equity managers and 30% with fixed income managers. Management regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the portfolio to the targeted allocation when considered appropriate. While investment performance in 2000 2002 and lower discount rates have significantly reduced pension income from previous or historical levels, the pension trust has been and remains adequately funded, and no contributions have been required since 1997. As such, these occurrences have had no impact on the Companys cash flows. Based on stress testing performed by the Companys actuaries, management does not anticipate the need to make pension contributions until after 2009. Similar to its pension accounting, the Company follows SFAS 106, "Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions," in accounting for its postretirement medical and life insurance benefits. This plan is unfunded, so no assumptions related to rate of return on assets impact the net expense recorded; however, the selection of discount rates can significantly impact the actuarial determination of net expense. The Company used a discount rate of 6.0% and recorded a net SFAS 106 cost of $13.4 million for 2004. Had the selected discount rate been 5.75%, the expense for 2004 would have been approximately $0.1 million higher. Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143 provides guidance for recording and disclosing liabilities related to future legally enforceable obligations to retire assets (ARO). SFAS 143 applies to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of long lived tangible assets that result from their acquisition, construction, development and normal operation. Because such obligation relates solely to the Companys regulated electric operations, adoption of SFAS 143 had no impact on results of operations. As of January 1, 2003, the Company had recorded an ARO of approximately $111 million, which exceeded the previously recorded reserve for nuclear plant decommissioning of approximately $87 million. At December 31, 2004 such ARO totaled approximately $124 million. The Company believes that there is legal uncertainty as to the existence of environmental obligations associated with certain of its electric transmission and distribution properties. The Company believes that any ARO related to this type of property would be insignificant and, due to the indeterminate life of the related assets, an ARO could not be reasonably estimated. OTHER MATTERS Claims and Litigation For a description of claims and litigation see Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. 112  ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All financial instruments held by SCE&G described below are held for purposes other than trading. Interest rate risk The tables below provide information about long term debt issued by SCE&G which is sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Fair values for debt represent quoted market prices. Expected Maturity Date December 31, 2004 Millions of dollars 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Fair Value Liabilities Long Term Debt: Fixed Rate ($) 189.2 169.9 39.2 39.2 139.2 1,718.2 2,294.9 2,285.7 Average Interest Rate (%) 7.37 8.51 6.86 6.86 6.33 6.02 6.36 N/A Expected Maturity Date December 31, 2003 Millions of dollars 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 Thereafter Total Fair Value Liabilities Long Term Debt: Fixed Rate ($) 139.2 189.2 169.9 39.2 39.2 1,721.9 2,298.6 2,239.8 Average Interest Rate (%) 7.46 7.37 8.51 6.86 6.86 6.06 6.46 While a decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt, it is unlikely that events which would result in a realized loss will occur. The above table excludes approximately $81 million and $51 million in long term debt as of December 31, 2004 and 2003, respectively, which amounts do not have a stated interest rate associated with them. 113
