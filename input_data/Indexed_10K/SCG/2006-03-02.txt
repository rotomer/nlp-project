OVERVIEW SCANA, through its wholly owned regulated subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in parts of South Carolina and the purchase, transmission and sale of natural gas in portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. Through a wholly owned nonregulated subsidiary, SCANA markets natural gas to retail customers in Georgia and to wholesale customers primarily in the southeast. Other wholly owned nonregulated subsidiaries perform power plant management and maintenance services, provide fiber optic and other telecommunications services, and provide service contracts to homeowners on certain home appliances and heating and air conditioning units. Additionally, a service company subsidiary of SCANA provides administrative, management and other services to the other subsidiaries. The activities of the Companys significant business segments are conducted primarily in the areas indicated on the following map, and as further described in this overview section. 27 table of contents Following are percentages of the Companys revenues and net income earned by regulated and nonregulated businesses and the percentage of total assets held by them. % of Revenues 2005 2004 2003 Regulated 69 % 71 % 73 % Nonregulated 31 % 29 % 27 % % of Net Income (Loss) 2005 2004(a ) 2003 Regulated 92 % 106 % 92 % Nonregulated 8 % (6 )% 8 % % of Assets 2005 2004 2003 Regulated 94 % 94 % 93 % Nonregulated 6 % 6 % 7 % (a) In 2004, net income for regulated businesses totaled $272.0 million and net loss for nonregulated businesses totaled $14.9 million. Net loss for nonregulated businesses included impairments and losses recognized on the sale of certain of the Companys telecommunications investments ($29.8 million, net of tax) and a charge related to pending litigation associated with the Companys 1999 sale of its propane assets ($11.1 million, net of taxes). See Results of Operations for more information. Key earnings drivers for the Company over the next five years will be additions to utility rate base at SCE&G and PSNC Energy, driven primarily by capital expenditures for environmental facilities, new generating capacity and system expansion. Other factors that will impact future earnings growth include the regulatory environment, customer growth in each of the regulated utility businesses, consistent earnings growth in the natural gas marketing business in Georgia, controlling interest expense through continued debt reduction and limiting the growth of operation and maintenance expenses. Electric Operations The electric operations segment is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, GENCO and Fuel Company, and is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in South Carolina. At December 31, 2005 SCE&G provided electricity to approximately 610,000 customers in an area covering approximately 17,000 square miles. GENCO owns and operates a coal fired generation station and sells electricity solely to SCE&G. Fuel Company acquires, owns and provides financing for SCE&Gs nuclear fuel, fossil fuel and sulfur dioxide emission allowance requirements. Operating results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for electricity, the ability to control costs and rates allowed to be charged to customers. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity. In January 2005, as a result of an electric rate case, SCE&Gs allowed return on equity was lowered from 12.45% to an amount not to exceed 11.4%, with rates set at 10.7%. See further discussion at Liquidity and Capital Resources. Demand for electricity is primarily affected by weather, customer growth and the economy. SCE&G is able to recover the cost of fuel used in electric generation through retail customers bills, but increases in fuel costs affect electric prices and, therefore, the competitive position of electricity against other energy sources. Legislative and regulatory initiatives, including the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the Energy Policy Act) also could significantly impact the results of operations and cash flows for the electric operations segment. The Energy Policy Act became law in August 2005, and it provides, among other things, for the establishment of an electric reliability organization (ERO) to propose and enforce mandatory reliability standards for transmission systems, for procedures governing enforcement actions by the ERO and FERC and for procedures under which the ERO may delegate authority to a regional entity to enforce reliability standards. In February 2006 FERC issued final rules to implement the electric reliability provisions of the Energy Policy Act. The Company is reviewing these rules and will monitor their implementation to determine the impact they may have on SCE&Gs access to or cost of power for its native load customers and for its marketing of power outside its service territory. The Company cannot predict when or if FERC will advance other regulatory initiatives related to the national energy market or what conditions such initiatives would impose on utilities. New legislation may also impose stringent requirements on power plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury. It is also possible that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The Company cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted, and if it is, the conditions it would impose on utilities. 28 table of contents Gas Distribution The gas distribution segment is comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G and PSNC Energy, and is primarily engaged in the purchase, transmission and sale of natural gas in portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. At December 31, 2005 this segment provided natural gas to approximately 717,000 customers in an area covering approximately 34,000 square miles. Operating results for gas distribution are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas, the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity. For SCE&G this allowed return on equity was 12.25% for January 1 through October 31, 2005, when it was lowered to 10.25% as a result of a rate case. For PSNC Energy this allowed return on equity was 11.4% for all of 2005. In the second quarter of 2006, PSNC Energy plans to file with the NCUC a request to increase base rates. Specific details related to the timing and size of the request have not been finalized. Demand for natural gas is primarily affected by weather, customer growth, the economy and, for commercial and industrial customers, the availability and price of alternate fuels. Natural gas competes with electricity, propane and heating oil to serve the heating and, to a lesser extent, other household energy needs of residential and small commercial customers. This competition is generally based on price and convenience. Large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel, such as propane or fuel oil. Natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price. As a result, any significant disparity between supply and demand, either of natural gas or of alternate fuels, and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors, will affect price and impact the Companys ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers. Significant supply disruptions did occur in September and October 2005 as a result of hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in the curtailment during the period of most large commercial and industrial customers with interruptible supply agreements. While supply disruptions are no longer being experienced, the price of natural gas remains volatile and has resulted in short term competitive pressure. The long term impact of volatile gas prices and gas supply has not been determined. Gas Transmission For 2005 the gas transmission segment was comprised of SCPC, which owns and operates an intrastate pipeline engaged in the purchase, transmission and sale of natural gas on a wholesale basis to distribution companies (including SCE&G) and industrial customers throughout most of South Carolina. Operating results for 2005 were primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas, the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers. Embedded in these rates is an allowed regulatory return on equity, which in 2005 was 12.5% to 16.5%. Demand for natural gas is primarily affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth. SCPC supplies natural gas to SCE&G for its resale to gas distribution customers and for certain electric generation needs. SCPC also sells natural gas to large commercial and industrial customers in South Carolina and faces the same competitive pressures as the gas distribution segment for these classes of customers. In 2006 SCANA expects to merge two of its subsidiaries, SCPC and SCG Pipeline, Inc., into a new company to be called Carolina Gas Transmission Corporation (CGTC). CGTC will operate as an open access transportation only interstate pipeline company. On February 27, 2006, the merger application was filed with FERC. SCANA does not expect a final decision regarding the merger from FERC before the third quarter of 2006. Retail Gas Marketing SCANA Energy, a division of SEMI, comprises the retail gas marketing segment. This segment markets natural gas to over 475,000 customers (as of December 31, 2005) throughout Georgia. SCANA Energys total customer base represents about a 30 percent share of the approximately 1.5 million customers in Georgias deregulated natural gas market. SCANA Energy remains the second largest natural gas marketer in the state. SCANA Energys competitors include affiliates of other large energy companies with experience in Georgias energy market as well as several electric membership cooperatives. SCANA Energys ability to maintain its market share depends on the prices it charges customers relative to the prices charged by its competitors, its ability to continue to provide high levels of customer service and other factors. In addition, the pipeline capacity available for SCANA Energy to serve industrial and other customers is tied to the market share held by SCANA Energy in the retail market. As Georgias regulated provider, SCANA Energy serves low income customers and customers unable to obtain or maintain natural gas service from other marketers at rates approved by the GPSC, and it receives funding from the Universal Service Fund for some of the bad debt associated with the low income group. In June 2005, the Georgia Public Service Commission (GPSC) voted to retain SCANA Energy as Georgias regulated provider of natural gas for a two year period ending August 31, 2007, with an option by the GPSC to extend the term for an additional year. In connection with this contract extension, SCANA Energy has agreed to file financial and other information periodically with the GPSC, and such information will be available at www.psc.state.ga.us. At December 31, 2005, SCANA Energys regulated division served over 70,000 customers. 29 table of contents SCANA Energy and SCANAs other natural gas distribution, transmission and marketing segments maintain gas inventory and also utilize forward contracts and financial instruments, including futures contracts and options, to manage their exposure to fluctuating commodity natural gas prices. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. As a part of this risk management process, at any given time, a portion of SCANAs projected natural gas needs has been purchased or otherwise placed under contract. Since SCANA Energy operates in a competitive market, it may be unable to sustain its current levels of customers and or pricing, thereby reducing expected margins and profitability. Further, there can be no assurance that Georgias gas delivery regulatory framework will remain unchanged as dynamic market conditions evolve. SCANA Energy, pursuant to a written agreement, has maintained a long standing marketing alliance with Cobb Energy Management Corporation (Cobb Energy), an affiliate of Cobb Electric Membership Corporation (Cobb EMC), and other Georgia electric membership cooperatives (collectively, the EMCs) under the terms of which the parties have worked in an exclusive relationship to attract, retain and serve customers for SCANA Energy. In July 2005, Southern Company Gas, the natural gas marketing affiliate of Southern Company, announced that it had signed a letter of intent to negotiate the sale of its business to a soon to be formed affiliate of Cobb EMC. In connection with this proposed transaction, Cobb Energy, on behalf of itself and the EMCs, entered into discussions with SCANA Energy to modify the marketing alliance. As a result of those discussions, effective October 31, 2005, SCANA Energy and the EMCs amended the marketing alliance so that, in an orderly fashion in 2006, the EMCs will transition to SCANA Energy certain call center and customer related administrative functions, such as billing and collections, which are currently being provided to a portion of SCANA Energys customers by the EMCs. During the process and subsequent to the completion of the transition, certain other requirements also must be met by the EMCs until such time as the marketing alliance expires in October 2008. SCANA Energy believes that its current customer service and billing systems have the capacity to accommodate the additional customers and that it will have the resources in place to assume responsibility for providing these services for its customers. SCANA Energy expects that the transition will have minimal impact on its customers or related customer service functions. However, as noted above, there can be no assurance that SCANA Energy will be able to maintain its current level of customers, and therefore, no assurance that its current level of profitability will be sustained. Energy Marketing The divisions of SEMI, excluding SCANA Energy, comprise the energy marketing segment. This segment markets natural gas primarily in the southeast and provides energy related risk management services to producers and customers. The operating results for energy marketing are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas and the ability to control costs. Demand for natural gas is primarily affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Companys reported earnings are determined in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that, in addition to reported earnings under GAAP, the Companys GAAP adjusted net earnings from operations provides a meaningful representation of its fundamental earnings power and can aid in performing period over period financial analysis and comparison with peer group data. In managements opinion, GAAP adjusted net earnings from operations is a useful indicator of the financial results of the Companys primary businesses. This measure is also a basis for managements provision of earnings guidance and growth projections, and it is used by management in making resource allocation and other budgetary and operational decisions. This non GAAP performance measure is not intended to replace the GAAP measure of net earnings, but is offered as a supplement to it. A reconciliation of reported (GAAP) earnings per share to GAAP adjusted net earnings from operations per share, as well as cash dividend information, is provided in the table below: 2005 2004 2003 Reported (GAAP) earnings per share $ 2.81 $ 2.30 $ 2.54 Add (Deduct): Gains from sales of telecommunications investments (.03 ) (.35 ) Losses from sales of telecommunications investments .14 Telecommunications investment impairments .13 .31 Charge related to pending litigation .10 GAAP adjusted net earnings from operations per share $ 2.78 $ 2.67 $ 2.50 Cash dividends declared (per share) $ 1.56 $ 1.46 $ 1.38 30 table of contents Discussion of above adjustments: Realized gains (losses) on telecommunications investments of $.03, $(.14) and $.35 were recognized in 2005 2004 and 2003, respectively, and arose as a result of the Companys monetization of these telecommunications investments. All significant telecommunications investments have now been monetized. The gain of $.03 per share in 2005 resulted from the receipt in 2005 of additional proceeds from the 2003 sale of the Companys investment in ITC Holding Company (ITC Holding). These additional proceeds had been held in escrow pending resolution of certain contingencies. The loss of $.14 per share in 2004 related to the sale of substantially all of the Companys holdings in ITC^DeltaCom, Inc. (ITC^DeltaCom) and Knology, Inc. (Knology) in December of 2004. The gain of $.35 per share in 2003 arose from the sale of the Companys interest in ITC Holding and the receipt of a minority investment interest in a newly formed entity, Magnolia Holding Company, LLC (Magnolia Holding). The Companys Knology holdings experienced other than temporary impairments of $.13 per share in 2004 and $.31 per share in 2003, prior to their monetization in December 2004. The charge related to pending litigation recognized in 2004 resulted from an unfavorable verdict in a case in which an unsuccessful bidder for the purchase of certain of the Companys propane gas assets in 1999 alleged breach of contract and related claims. Both parties have appealed the judgment. See also Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Management believes that all of the above adjustments are appropriate in determining the non GAAP financial performance measure. Management utilizes such measure itself in exercising budgetary control, managing business operations and determining eligibility for incentive compensation payments. Such non GAAP measure is based on managements decision that the passive telecommunications investments were not a part of the Companys core businesses and would not be available to provide earnings on a long term basis. The non GAAP measure also provides a consistent basis upon which to measure performance by excluding the effects on per share earnings of transactions involving the Companys telecommunications investments and the litigation charge related to the sale of a prior business. Pension Income Pension income was recorded on the Companys financial statements as follows: Millions of dollars 2005 2004 2003 Income Statement Impact: (Component of) reduction in employee benefit costs $ 4.3 $ 2.9 $ (2.3 ) Other income 11.9 10.8 7.9 Balance Sheet Impact: (Component of) reduction in capital expenditures 1.3 1.0 (0.5 ) Component of (reduction in) amount due to Summer Station co owner 0.6 0.4 (0.1 ) Total Pension Income $ 18.1 $ 15.1 $ 5.0 For the last several years, the market value of the Companys retirement plan (pension) assets has exceeded the total actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits. Pension incomes significant increase in 2004 is consistent with overall investment market results. See also the discussion of pension accounting in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFC) AFC is a utility accounting practice whereby a portion of the cost of both equity and borrowed funds used to finance construction (which is shown on the balance sheet as construction work in progress) is capitalized. The Company includes an equity portion of AFC in nonoperating income and a debt portion of AFC in interest charges (credits) as noncash items, both of which have the effect of increasing reported net income. AFC represented approximately 1.4% of income before income taxes in 2005, 6.8% in 2004 and 7.4% in 2003. The lower level of AFC for 2005 is primarily due to reductions in the levels of capital expenditures subsequent to the completion of the Jasper County Electric Generation Station in May 2004 and completion of the Lake Murray Dam project in May 2005. Recognition of Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits SCE&G holds equity method investments in two partnerships involved in converting coal to synthetic fuel, the use of which fuel qualifies for federal income tax credits. These synthetic fuel production facilities were placed in operation in 2000 and 2001. Under an accounting plan approved by the SCPSC in June 2000, the synthetic fuel tax credits generated by the partnerships and passed through to SCE&G, net of partnership losses and other expenses, were deferred until the SCPSC approved its application to offset capital costs of the Lake Murray Dam project as described below. 31 table of contents In a January 2005 order, the SCPSC approved SCE&Gs request to apply these synthetic fuel tax credits to offset the construction costs of the Lake Murray Dam project. Under the accounting methodology approved by the SCPSC, construction costs related to the project were recorded in utility plant in service in a special dam remediation account outside of rate base, and depreciation is being recognized against the balance in this account on an accelerated basis, subject to the availability of the synthetic fuel tax credits. The level of depreciation expense and related tax benefit recognized in the income statement is equal to the available synthetic fuel tax credits, less partnership losses and other expenses, net of taxes. As a result, the balance of unrecovered costs in the dam remediation account is declining as accelerated depreciation is recorded. Although these entries collectively have no impact on consolidated net income, they have a significant impact on individual line items within the income statement. In addition, SCE&G is allowed to record non cash carrying costs on the unrecovered investment. The accelerated depreciation, synthetic fuel tax credits, partnership losses and the income tax benefit arising from such losses recognized by SCE&G during 2005 are as follows: Recognized 4th Quarter Year Ended December 31, Millions of dollars 2005 2005 Depreciation and amortization expense $ (13.2 ) $ (214.0 ) Income tax benefits: From synthetic fuel tax credits 10.9 179.0 From accelerated depreciation 5.0 81.8 From partnership losses 1.7 28.9 Total income tax benefits 17.6 289.7 Losses from Equity Method Investments (4.4 ) (75.7 ) Impact on Net Income Electric Operations Electric Operations is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, GENCO and Fuel Company.

These increases were offset by a $2.4 million decrease due to unfavorable weather. Fuel used in generation increased $151.4 million due primarily to the increased cost of coal and natural gas used for electric generation. Purchased power decreased due to greater availability of generation facilities. 2004 vs 2003 Margin increased by $47.2 million due to increased off system sales, by $22.9 million due to increased customer growth and consumption, by $22.3 million due to favorable weather and by $7.1 million due to the increase in retail electric base rates effective February 2003. Fuel used in generation increased by $103.0 million due to increased availability of generation facilities and by $30.0 million due to increased cost of coal. Purchased power decreased due to greater availability of generation facilities. 32 table of contents MWh sales volumes by class, related to the electric margin above, were as follows: Classification (in thousands) 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Residential 7,634 2.3 % 7,460 6.6 % 6,998 Commercial 7,047 2.1 % 6,900 4.4 % 6,607 Industrial 6,651 (1.8 )% 6,775 3.5 % 6,548 Sales for resale (excluding interchange) 1,487 (2.5 )% 1,525 6.1 % 1,438 Other 527 0.2 % 526 5.2 % 500 Total territorial 23,346 0.7 % 23,186 5.0 % 22,091 NMST 1,794 (2.8 )% 1,845 * 425 Total 25,140 0.4 % 25,031 11.2 % 22,516 * Greater than 100% 2005 vs 2004 Territorial sales volumes increased by 407 MWh primarily due to customer growth partially offset by 261 MWh due to less favorable weather. 2004 vs 2003 Territorial sales volumes increased by 334 MWh and 774 MWh due to customer growth and weather, respectively. Gas Distribution Gas Distribution is comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G and PSNC Energy. Gas distribution sales margins (including transactions with affiliates) were as follows: Millions of dollars 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Operating revenues $ 1,168.6 27.9 % $ 913.9 5.2 % $ 869.0 Less: Gas purchased for resale 894.6 36.6 % 655.1 9.3 % 599.3 Margin $ 274.0 5.9 % $ 258.8 (4.0 )% $ 269.7 2005 vs 2004 Margin increased primarily due to customer growth of $6.9 million at PSNC Energy, higher firm margin of $4.7 million at SCE&G and $4.6 million due to increased retail gas base rates at SCE&G which became effective with the first billing cycle in November 2005. These increases were offset by a $0.8 million decrease due to lower interruptible margin and transportation revenue at SCE&G. 2004 vs 2003 Margin decreased primarily due to a decrease in SCE&Gs billing surcharge for the recovery of environmental remediation expenses of $5.0 million, lower residential and commercial sales volumes of $2.5 million and $5.1 million due to milder weather. This was partially offset by customer growth at PSNC Energy of $4.0 million. DT sales volumes by class, including transportation gas, were as follows: Classification (in thousands) 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Residential 37,860 1.7 % 37,231 (3.4 )% 38,542 Commercial 27,750 1.8 % 27,271 (1.6 )% 27,715 Industrial 20,833 7.8 % 19,320 (3.9 )% 20,109 Transportation gas 27,698 (1.8 )% 28,216 11.1 % 25,387 Sales for resale * 1 * 1 Total 114,141 1.9 % 112,039 0.3 % 111,754 * Not meaningful 2005 vs 2004 Commercial and industrial volumes increased primarily due to more customers buying commodity gas instead of purchasing alternate fuels and instead of transporting gas purchased from others. 2004 vs 2003 Residential and commercial sales volumes decreased primarily due to unfavorable consumption patterns. Transportation volumes increased primarily as a result of interruptible customers using gas instead of alternative fuels. 33 table of contents Gas Transmission Gas Transmission is comprised of the operations of SCPC.

Transportation volumes increased by 7.5 million DTs due to a new contract with a firm transportation customer and by 4.9 million DTs due to new transportation contracts with resale customers. Sales for resale volumes decreased primarily due to the previously mentioned new transportation contracts with resale customers. Retail Gas Marketing Retail Gas Marketing is comprised of SCANA Energy, which operates in Georgias natural gas market. Retail Gas Marketing revenues and net income were as follows: Millions of dollars 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Operating revenues $ 663.8 20.3 % $ 552.0 23.1 % $ 448.3 Net income 24.1 (16.9 )% 29.0 44.3 % 20.1 2005 vs 2004 Operating revenues increased primarily as a result of higher average retail prices necessitated by higher commodity cost of gas. Net income decreased primarily due to increased bad debt of $5.9 million, and operating, marketing and customer service expenses of $4.4 million, offsetting a margin increase of $5.2 million, net of taxes. 2004 vs 2003 Operating revenues increased primarily as a result of increased volumes and higher average retail prices. Net income increased primarily due to higher margins of $16.7 million, partially offset by increased bad debt of $2.9 million, increased depreciation expense of $0.7 million and higher customer service expenses of $2.0 million. Delivered volumes for 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled 37.9 million, 37.9 million and 35.6 million DT, respectively. 34 table of contents Energy Marketing Energy Marketing is comprised of the Companys non regulated marketing operations, excluding SCANA Energy. Energy Marketing operating revenues and net loss were as follows: Millions of dollars 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Operating revenues $ 945.6 58.5 % $ 596.5 43.5 % $ 415.7 Net loss (0.6 ) 70.0 % (2.0 ) (81.8 )% (1.1 ) 2005 vs 2004 Operating revenues increased due to higher market prices and higher sales volume. Net loss decreased primarily due to higher margins of $0.6 million and lower operating expenses of $0.8 million. 2004 vs 2003 Operating revenues increased due to higher market prices and higher sales volumes. Net loss increased primarily due to higher operating expenses of $2.0 million partially offset by higher margins of $0.8 million. Delivered volumes for 2005, 2004 and 2003 totaled approximately 101.0 million, 91.8 million and 73.6 million DT, respectively. Delivered volumes increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily as a result of increased service to municipalities in South Carolina. Delivered volumes increased in 2004 compared to 2003 primarily as a result of the commencement of service to the Jasper County Electric Generating Station in 2004, which created 11.2 million DT of additional volume. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses, which arose from the operating segments previously discussed, were as follows: Millions of dollars 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Other operation and maintenance $ 632.0 4.0 % $ 607.5 8.8 % $ 558.3 Depreciation and amortization 509.9 92.3 % 265.1 11.2 % 238.3 Other taxes 145.0 (0.4 )% 145.6 4.6 % 139.2 Total $ 1,286.9 26.4 % $ 1,018.2 8.8 % $ 935.8 2005 vs 2004 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to increased electric generation major maintenance expenses of $6.7 million, increased expenses associated with the Jasper County Electric Generating Station completed in May 2004 totaling $2.4 million, increased nuclear operating and maintenance expenses of $2.4 million, higher expenses related to regulatory matters of $1.9 million and higher amortization of regulatory assets of $3.6 million. The increases were offset primarily by decreased long term bonus and incentive plan expenses of $4.8 million and decreased storm damage expenses of $0.9 million. Depreciation and amortization increased approximately $214.0 million due to accelerated depreciation of the back up dam at Lake Murray (previously explained at Recognition of Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits), increased $6.5 million due to the completion of the Jasper County Electric Generating Station in May 2004 and $6.1 million due to normal net property changes at SCE&G. In addition, as a result of the January 2005 rate order, SCE&G received approval to amortize previously deferred purchased power costs and to implement new depreciation rates, resulting in $17.3 million of additional depreciation and amortization expense in the period. 2004 vs 2003 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to increased labor and benefit expense of $26.3 million, higher bad debt expense of $5.8 million, increased expenses at the generation plants of $11.0 million, winter storm expense of $2.5 million and increased gas marketing and customer billing costs of $4.2 million, partially offset by increased pension income of $5.2 million. Depreciation and amortization increased by $13.4 million due to completion of the Jasper County Electric Generating Station and $11.1 million as a result of normal net property additions. Other taxes increased primarily due to increased property taxes. Other Income (Expense) Components of other income (expense), excluding the equity component of AFC, were as follows: Millions of dollars 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Gain (loss) on sale of investments $ 7.2 * $ (21.0 ) * $ 59.8 Gain on sale of assets 1.7 * 0.7 (41.7 )% 1.2 Impairment of investments * (26.9 ) (49.3 )% (53.1 ) Other revenues 248.1 36.9 % 181.2 8.6 % 166.8 Other expenses (200.3 ) 25.2 % (159.9 ) 30.2 % (122.8 ) Total $ 56.7 * $ (25.9 ) * $ 51.9 * Greater than 100% 35 table of contents Gain (loss) on sale of investments increased due to the receipt in 2005 of additional proceeds of $6.0 million from the 2003 sale of the Companys investment in ITC Holding. These proceeds had been held in escrow pending resolution of certain contingencies. In 2004 the Company recognized a $21 million loss on the sale of investments in Knology and ITC^DeltaCom. In 2003 a $59.8 million gain on sale of investments was recognized in connection with the sale of ITC Holding and the receipt of a minority interest in a newly formed entity (Magnolia Holding). In 2004 impairments of $26.9 million were recorded on Knology, ITC Holding and Magnolia Holding. Impairments in 2003 related to an investment in Knology. Interest Expense Components of interest expense, excluding the debt component of AFC, were as follows: Millions of dollars 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Interest on long term debt, net $ 202.8 (2.5 )% $ 208.1 1.4 % $ 205.2 Other interest expense 12.6 * 4.3 (25.9 )% 5.8 Total $ 215.4 1.4 % $ 212.4 0.7 % $ 211.0 * Greater than 100% 2005 vs 2004 Interest on long term debt decreased primarily due to the redemption of outstanding debt in late 2004. Other interest expense increased primarily due to increased short term debt at SCE&G. 2004 vs 2003 Interest expense increased primarily due to slightly higher levels of borrowing outstanding during 2004 until the payment of maturing debt late in the year. Income Taxes Income taxes decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 by $240.8 million and decreased $12.4 million in 2004 compared to 2003. Changes in income taxes are primarily due to changes in operating income and other income, although in 2005 the benefits of synthetic fuel credits of $179.0 were also recognized pursuant to the January 2005 electric rate order. The Companys effective tax rate has been favorably impacted in recent years by the flow through of state investment tax credits and the equity portion of AFC. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash requirements for SCANAs regulated subsidiaries arise primarily from their operational needs, funding their construction programs and payment of dividends to SCANA. The ability of the regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant investment, as well as to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas, will depend on their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms. Regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers. Rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs. As customer growth and inflation occur and these subsidiaries continue their ongoing construction programs, rate increases will be sought. The future financial position and results of operations of the regulated subsidiaries will be affected by their ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief, if requested. In a January 2005 order, the SCPSC granted SCE&G a composite increase in retail electric rates of approximately 2.89%, designed to produce additional annual revenues of approximately $41.4 million based on a test year calculation. The SCPSC lowered SCE&Gs allowed return on common equity from 12.45% to an amount not to exceed 11.4%, with rates set at 10.7%. The new rates became effective in January 2005. As part of its order, the SCPSC approved SCE&Gs recovery of construction and operating costs for SCE&Gs new Jasper County Electric Generating Station, recovery of costs of mandatory environmental upgrades primarily related to Federal Clean Air Act regulations and the application of current and anticipated net synthetic fuel tax credits to offset the cost of constructing the back up dam at Lake Murray. The SCPSC also approved recovery over a five year period of SCE&Gs approximately $14 million of costs incurred in the formation of the GridSouth Regional Transmission Organization and recovery through base rates over three years of approximately $25.6 million of purchased power costs that were previously deferred. As a part of its order, the SCPSC extended through 2010 its approval of the accelerated capital recovery plan for SCE&Gs Cope Generating Station. Under the plan, in the event that SCE&G would otherwise earn in excess of its maximum allowed return on common equity, SCE&G may increase depreciation of its Cope Generating Station up to $36 million annually without additional approval of the SCPSC. Any unused portion of the $36 million in any given year may be carried forward for possible use in the immediately following year. No such additional depreciation was recognized in 2005, 2004 or 2003. 36 table of contents In October 2005, the SCPSC granted SCE&G an overall increase of $22.9 million, or 5.69%, in retail gas base rates. The new rates are based on an allowed return on common equity of 10.25% and became effective with the first billing cycle in November 2005. SCE&G expects to require the addition of base load electrical generation by 2015 and is evaluating alternatives, including fossil and nuclear fueled generation. On February 10, 2006, SCE&G and Santee Cooper, a state owned utility in South Carolina (joint owners of Summer Station) announced their selection of the Summer Station site as the preferred site for a new nuclear plant should nuclear generation be considered the best alternative in the future. Due to the significant lead time required for construction of a nuclear plant, the joint owners are preparing an application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a combined construction and operating license (COL). The COL application, which is expected to be completed and filed in 2007, would be reviewed by the NRC for an estimated three years. Issuance of a COL would not obligate the joint owners to build a nuclear plant. The final decision to build a nuclear plant will be influenced by several factors, including NRC licensing attainment, construction and operating costs, the cost of competing fuels, regulatory and environmental requirements and financial market conditions. The Companys leverage ratio of debt to capital was 56% at December 31, 2005. The Companys goal is to reduce this leverage ratio to between 50% and 52%. If the agencies rating the Companys credit determine that the Company will not be able to achieve sufficient improvement in the leverage ratio, among other measures, these rating agencies may downgrade the Companys debt. Such a downgrade would adversely affect the interest rate the Company is able to obtain when issuing debt, would increase the rates applicable to the Companys short term commercial paper programs and long term debt and would limit the Companys access to capital markets. In order to bring the leverage ratio in line with rating agency expectations, the Company may apply cash flows from operations to debt reduction, sell equity securities, or a combination of the two. The Companys current estimates of its cash requirements for construction and nuclear fuel expenditures for 2006 2008, which are subject to continuing review and adjustment, are as follows: Estimated Cash Requirements Millions of dollars 2006 2007 2008 SCE&G: Electric Plant: Generation (including GENCO) $ 128 $ 86 $ 193 Transmission 50 44 46 Distribution 115 114 115 Other 18 11 14 Nuclear Fuel 27 25 5 Gas 27 26 31 Common 22 17 7 Other 2 Total SCE&G 389 323 411 PSNC Energy 70 78 84 Other Companies Combined 44 32 27 Total $ 503 $ 433 $ 522 The Companys contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2005 are summarized as follows: Contractual Cash Obligations Millions of dollars Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Long term and short term debt (including interest and preferred stock) $ 6,171 $ 874 $ 925 $ 920 $ 3,452 Capital leases 2 1 1 Operating leases 53 15 35 1 2 Purchase obligations 166 152 12 2 Other commercial commitments 8,955 1,633 2,207 1,124 3,991 Total $ 15,347 $ 2,675 $ 3,180 $ 2,047 $ 7,445 37 table of contents Included in other commercial commitments are estimated obligations under forward contracts for natural gas purchases. Many of these forward contracts include customary make whole or default provisions, but are not considered to be take or pay contracts. Certain of these contracts relate to regulated businesses; therefore, the effects of such contracts on fuel costs are reflected in electric or gas rates. Also included in other commercial commitments is a take and pay contract for natural gas which expires in 2019 and estimated obligations for coal and nuclear fuel purchases. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Included in purchase obligations are customary purchase orders under which the Company has the option to utilize certain vendors without the obligation to do so. The Company may terminate such obligations without penalty. In addition to the contractual cash obligations above, the Company sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan and an unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plan for retirees. The pension plan is adequately funded, and no further contributions are anticipated until after 2010. Cash payments under the health care and life insurance benefit plan were $10.8 million in 2005, and such annual payments are expected to increase to the $13 $14 million range in the future. In addition, the Company is party to certain NYMEX futures contracts for which any unfavorable market movements are funded in cash. These derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, and their effects are reflected within other comprehensive income until the anticipated sales transactions occur. See further discussion at Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company also has a legal obligation associated with the decommissioning and dismantling of Summer Station and other conditional asset retirement obligations that are not listed in the contractual cash obligations table. See Notes 1B and 1N to the consolidated financial statements. The Company anticipates that its contractual cash obligations will be met through internally generated funds, issuance of equity under dividend reinvestment and employee stock ownership plans, the incurrence of additional short term and long term indebtedness and other sales of equity securities. The Company expects that it has or can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet its projected cash requirements for the foreseeable future. Cash outlays for 2006 (estimated) and 2005 (actual) for certain expenditures are as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 2005 Property additions and construction expenditures, net of AFC $ 485 $ 385 Nuclear fuel expenditures 18 18 Investments 18 18 Total $ 521 $ 421 Financing Limits and Related Matters The Companys issuance of various securities, including long term and short term debt, is subject to customary approval or authorization by regulatory bodies including state public service commissions and FERC. Descriptions of financing programs currently utilized by the Company follow. At December 31, 2005 SCANA, SCE&G (including Fuel Company) and PSNC Energy had available the following lines of credit and short term borrowings outstanding: Millions of dollars SCANA SCE&G PSNC Energy Lines of credit (total and unused): Committed Short term $ 350 Long term (expires June 2010) $ 525 $ 125 Uncommitted 103(a ) 78(a ) Short term borrowings outstanding: Bank loans/commercial paper (270 or fewer days) $ 25 $ 303.1 $ 98.6 Weighted average interest rate 4.43 % 4.40 % 4.47 % (a) SCANA or SCE&G may use $78 million of these lines of credit. 38 table of contents SCANA Corporation SCANA has in effect a medium term note program for the issuance from time to time of unsecured medium term debt securities. While issuance of these securities requires customary approvals discussed above, the Indenture under which they are issued contains no specific limit on the amount which may be issued. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company SCE&Gs First and Refunding Mortgage Bond Indenture, dated January 1, 1945 (Old Mortgage) and covering substantially all of its properties, prohibits the issuance of additional bonds (Class A Bonds) unless net earnings (as therein defined) for 12 consecutive months out of the 18 months prior to the month of issuance are at least twice the annual interest requirements on all Class A Bonds to be outstanding (Bond Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2005 the Bond Ratio was 7.03. The Old Mortgage allows the issuance of Class A Bonds up to an additional principal amount equal to (i) 70% of unfunded net property additions (which unfunded net property additions certified to the trustee and other property eligible to be certified as property additions totaled approximately $2.0 billion at December 31, 2005), (ii) retirements of Class A Bonds (which retirement credits totaled $86.0 million at December 31, 2005), and (iii) cash on deposit with the Trustee. SCE&G is also subject to a bond indenture dated April 1, 1993 (New Mortgage) covering substantially all of its electric properties under which its future mortgage backed debt (New Bonds) will be issued. New Bonds are issued under the New Mortgage on the basis of a like principal amount of Class A Bonds issued under the Old Mortgage which have been deposited with the Trustee of the New Mortgage. At December 31, 2005, $1.2 billion Class A Bonds were on deposit with the Trustee of the New Mortgage and are available to support the issuance of additional New Bonds. New Bonds will be issuable under the New Mortgage only if adjusted net earnings (as therein defined) for 12 consecutive months out of the 18 months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least twice the annual interest requirements on all outstanding bonds (including Class A Bonds) and New Bonds to be outstanding (New Bond Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2005, the New Bond Ratio was 6.76. SCE&Gs Restated Articles of Incorporation (the Articles) prohibit issuance of additional shares of preferred stock without the consent of the preferred shareholders unless net earnings (as therein defined) for the 12 consecutive months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least one and one half times the aggregate of all interest charges and preferred stock dividend requirements on all shares of preferred stock outstanding immediately after the proposed issue (Preferred Stock Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Preferred Stock Ratio was 2.12. The Articles also require the consent of a majority of the total voting power of SCE&Gs preferred stock before SCE&G may issue or assume any unsecured indebtedness if, after such issue or assumption, the total principal amount of all such unsecured indebtedness would exceed ten percent of the aggregate principal amount of all of SCE&Gs secured indebtedness and capital and surplus (the ten percent test). No such consent is required to enter into agreements for payment of principal, interest and premium for securities issued for pollution control purposes. At December 31, 2005, the ten percent test would have limited issuances of unsecured indebtedness to approximately $419.5 million. Unsecured indebtedness at December 31, 2005, totaled approximately $246.6 million, and was comprised of short term borrowings and the interest free borrowing discussed below. In 2004 and 2005 SCE&G borrowed an aggregate $59 million available under an agreement with the South Carolina Transportation Infrastructure Bank (the Bank) and the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) that allows SCE&G to borrow funds from the Bank to construct a roadbed for SCDOT in connection with the Lake Murray Dam remediation project. Such borrowings are being repaid interest free over ten years from the initial borrowing. At December 31, 2005 SCE&G had $50.2 million outstanding under the agreement. Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated PSNC Energy has in effect a medium term note program for the issuance from time to time of unsecured medium term debt securities. While issuance of these securities requires regulatory approval, the Indenture under which they would be issued contains no specific limit on the amount which may be issued. 39 table of contents Financing Cash Flows During 2005 the Company experienced net cash outflows related to financing activities of approximately $131 million primarily due to the reduction of long term debt and payment of dividends. SCE&G also experienced net cash outflows related to financing activities of approximately $64 million primarily due to the payment of dividends. The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk. These swap agreements provide for the Company to pay variable and receive fixed rate interest payments and are designated as fair value hedges of certain debt instruments. The Company may terminate a swap agreement and may replace it with a new swap also designated as a fair value hedge. Payments received upon termination of such swaps are recorded as basis adjustments to long term debt and are amortized as reductions to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. At December 31, 2005, the estimated fair value of the Companys swaps totaled $0.1 million (gain) related to combined notional amounts of $47.4 million. In anticipation of the issuance of debt, the Company uses interest rate lock or similar agreements to manage interest rate risk. These arrangements are designated as cash flow hedges. As such, payments made upon termination of such agreements are amortized to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. In connection with the issuance of First Mortgage Bonds in May 2003, SCE&G paid $11.9 million upon the termination of a treasury lock agreement. In connection with the issuance of First Mortgage Bonds in December 2003, SCE&G paid $3.5 million upon the termination of a forward starting interest rate swap. In December 2005, SCE&G entered into a $125 million treasury lock agreement at an initial interest rate of 4.72% which will terminate by August 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2005, an unrealized loss on this treasury lock agreement in the amount of approximately $3.8 million has been recorded within other regulatory assets. Any gain or loss on the ultimate settlement of this swap will be amortized over the life of the debt to which it relates. For additional information on significant financing transactions, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. On February 16, 2006, SCANA increased the quarterly cash dividend rate on SCANA common stock to $.42 per share, an increase of 7.7%. The new dividend is payable April 1, 2006 to stockholders of record on March 10, 2006. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Capital Expenditures For the three years ended December 31, 2005, the Companys capital expenditures for environmental control totaled $200.2 million. These expenditures were in addition to expenditures included in Other operation and maintenance expenses, which were $25.2 million, $21.5 million, and $29.2 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. It is not possible to estimate all future costs related to environmental matters, but forecasts for capitalized environmental expenditures for the Company are $66.9 million for 2006 and $314.3 million for the four year period 2007 through 2010. These expenditures are included in the Companys construction program, discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources, and include the matters discussed below. Electric Operations In March 2005, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule known as the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). CAIR requires the District of Columbia and 28 states, including South Carolina, to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in order to attain mandated state levels. SCE&G has petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review CAIR. Several other electric utilities have filed separate petitions. The petitioners seek a change in the method CAIR uses to allocate sulfur dioxide emission allowances to a method the petitioners believe is more equitable. The Company will be installing additional air quality controls to meet the CAIR requirements. Installation and operation and maintenance costs are currently being determined. Such costs are likely to be material and are expected to be recoverable through rates. In March 2005 the EPA issued a final rule establishing a mercury emissions cap and trade program for coal fired power plants that requires limits to be met in two phases, in 2010 and 2018. The Company is negotiating with the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control the terms of the state compliance proposals. Installation of additional air quality controls is likely to be required to comply with the mercury rules emission caps. Compliance plans and costs to comply with the rule will be determined once the Company completes its review and assessments. Such costs are likely to be material and are expected to be recoverable through rates. 40 table of contents The EPA has undertaken an aggressive enforcement initiative against the utilities industry, and the DOJ has brought suit against a number of utilities in federal court alleging violations of the CAA. At least two of these suits have either been tried or have had substantive motions decidedone favorable to the industry and one not. The one not favorable to the Company is not binding as precedent and the one favorable to the Company likely is precedent and is consistent with current Company interpretation of the law and its resulting maintenance practices. Prior to the suits, those utilities had received requests for information under Section 114 of the CAA and were issued Notices of Violation. The basis for these suits is the assertion by the EPA, under a stringent rule known as New Source Review (NSR), that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities over the past 20 or more years constitute major modifications which would have required the installation of costly Best Available Control Technology (BACT). SCE&G and GENCO have received and responded to Section 114 requests for information related to Canadys, Wateree and Williams Stations. The regulations under the CAA provide certain exemptions to the definition of major modifications, including an exemption for routine repair, replacement or maintenance. On October 27, 2003, EPA published a final revised NSR rule in the Federal Register with an effective date of December 26, 2003. The new rule represents an industry favorable departure from certain positions advanced by the federal government in the NSR enforcement initiative. However, on motion of several Northeastern states, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stayed the effect of the final rule. The ultimate application of the final rule to the Company is uncertain. The Company has analyzed each of the activities covered by the EPAs requests and believes each of these activities is covered by the exemption for routine repair, replacement and maintenance under what it believes is a fair reading of both the prior regulation and the contested revised regulation. The regulations also provide an exemption for an increase in emissions resulting from increased hours of operation or production rate and from demand growth. The current state of continued DOJ enforcement actions is the subject of industry wide speculation, but it is possible that the EPA will commence enforcement actions against SCE&G and GENCO, and the EPA has the authority to seek penalties at the rate of up to $27,500 per day for each violation. The EPA also could seek installation of BACT (or equivalent) at the three plants. The Company believes that any enforcement actions relative to the Companys, SCE&Gs or GENCOs compliance with the CAA would be without merit. The Company has completed installation of selective catalytic reactors at Wateree and Williams for nitrogen oxides control and is proceeding with plans to install sulfur dioxide scrubbers at both of these stations to meet CAIR regulations. These actions would mitigate many of the concerns with NSR. SCE&G and GENCO expect to incur capital expenditures totaling approximately $331 million over the 2006 2009 period to install this new equipment. SCE&G and GENCO expect to have increased operation and maintenance costs of approximately $4 million in 2009 and $27 million in 2010 and subsequent years. To meet compliance requirements for the years 2011 through 2015, the Company anticipates additional capital expenditures totaling approximately $564 million. The Clean Water Act, as amended, provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require treatment for wastewater discharges. Under the Clean Water Act, compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program. Discharge permits have been issued for all, and renewed for nearly all, of SCE&Gs and GENCOs generating units. Concurrent with renewal of these permits, the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program of monitoring and controlling discharges, has modified the requirements for cooling water intake structures, and has required strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams. The Company is conducting studies and is developing or implementing compliance plans for these initiatives. Congress is expected to consider further amendments to the Clean Water Act. Such legislation may include limitations to mixing zones and toxicity based standards. These provisions, if passed, could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company, SCE&G and GENCO. Nuclear Fuel Disposal The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 ( the Nuclear Waste Act) required that the United States government, by January 31, 1998, accept and permanently dispose of high level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. The Nuclear Waste Act also imposes on utilities the primary responsibility for storage of their spent nuclear fuel until the repository is available. SCE&G entered into a Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and or High Level Radioactive Waste (Standard Contract) with the DOE in 1983 providing for permanent disposal of its spent nuclear fuel in exchange for agreed payments fixed in the Standard Contract at particular amounts. On January 28, 2004, SCE&G and Santee Cooper (one third owner of Summer Station) filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims against the DOE for breach of the Standard Contract, because as of the date of filing, the federal government had accepted no spent fuel from Summer Station or any other utility for transport and disposal, and has indicated that it does not anticipate doing so until 2010, at the earliest. As a consequence of the federal governments breach of contract, the plaintiffs have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs. On January 9, 2006, SCE&G and Santee Cooper accepted a settlement from DOE which requires the payment by DOE of $9 million to the plaintiffs. The payment is to reimburse the plaintiffs for certain costs incurred from January 31, 1998 through July 31, 2005. SCE&G will record its portion ($6 million) of the settlement as a reduction to its fuel costs. As a result, most of the credit will be passed through to its customers through the fuel clause component of its retail electric rates. The settlement also provides for the plaintiffs to submit an annual application to DOE for the reimbursement of certain costs incurred subsequent to July 31, 2005. SCE&G has on site spent nuclear fuel storage capability until at least 2018 and expects to be able to expand its storage capacity to accommodate the spent nuclear fuel output for the life of the plant through dry cask storage or other technology as it becomes available. 41 table of contents Gas Distribution The Company maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could require environmental cleanup. As site assessments are initiated, estimates are made of the amount of expenditures, if any, deemed necessary to investigate and clean up each site. These estimates are refined as additional information becomes available; therefore, actual expenditures may differ significantly from the original estimates. Amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and cleanup relate solely to regulated operations and are recorded in deferred debits and amortized with recovery provided through rates. Deferred amounts for SCE&G, net of amounts previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements, totaled $17.7 million and $10.5 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The deferral includes the estimated costs associated with the following matters. SCE&G owns a decommissioned MGP site in the Calhoun Park area of Charleston, South Carolina. The site is currently being remediated for contamination. SCE&G anticipates that the remaining remediation activities will be completed by mid 2006, with certain monitoring and retreatment activities continuing until 2011. As of December 31, 2005, SCE&G has spent $21.5 million to remediate the Calhoun Park site, and expects to spend an additional $0.3 million. In addition, the National Park Service of the Department of the Interior made an initial demand to SCE&G for payment of $9.1 million for certain costs and damages relating to this site. Any cost arising from this matter is expected to be recoverable through rates. SCE&G owns three other decommissioned MGP sites in South Carolina which contain residues of by product chemicals. One of the sites has been remediated and will undergo routine monitoring until released by DHEC. The other sites are currently being investigated under work plans approved by DHEC. SCE&G anticipates that major remediation activities for the three sites will be completed in 2010. As of December 31, 2005, SCE&G has spent $4.5 million related to these three sites, and expects to spend an additional $11.5 million. Any cost arising from this matter is expected to be recoverable through rates. SCE&G has been named, along with 27 others, by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at the Carolina Transformer Superfund site located in Fayetteville, NC. The Carolina Transformer Company (CTC) conducted an electrical transformer rebuilding and repair operation at the site from 1967 to 1984. During that time, SCE&G occasionally used CTC for the repair of existing transformers and the purchase of new transformers. In 1984, EPA initiated a cleanup of PCB contaminated soil and groundwater at the site. EPA reports that it has spent $36 million to date. SCE&Gs records indicated that only minimal quantities of used transformers were shipped by it to CTC, and it is not clear if any contained PCB contaminated oil. Although a basis for the allocation of clean up costs among the 28 PRPs is unclear, SCE&G does not believe that its involvement at this site would result in an allocation of costs that would have a material adverse impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Any cost arising from this matter is expected to be recoverable through rates. PSNC Energy is responsible for environmental cleanup at five sites in North Carolina on which MGP residuals are present or suspected. PSNC Energys actual remediation costs for these sites will depend on a number of factors, such as actual site conditions, third party claims and recoveries from other PRPs. PSNC Energy has recorded a liability and associated regulatory asset of $7.4 million, which reflects its estimated remaining liability at December 31, 2005. Amounts incurred and deferred to date, net of insurance settlements, that are not currently being recovered through gas rates are $3.1 million. Management believes that all MGP cleanup costs will be recoverable through gas rates. REGULATORY MATTERS Material retail rate proceedings are described in more detail in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company SCE&G is subject to the jurisdiction of the SCPSC as to retail electric and gas rates, service, accounting, issuance of securities (other than short term borrowings) and other matters. See earlier discussion of increase in retail electric and gas base rates during 2005 in Liquidity and Capital Resources. In February 2005, the Natural Gas Stabilization Act of 2005 (Stabilization Act) became law in South Carolina. The Stabilization Act allows natural gas distribution companies to request annual adjustments to rates to reflect changes in revenues and expenses and changes in investment. Such annual adjustments are subject to certain qualifying criteria and review by the SCPSC. 42 table of contents Synthetic Fuel SCE&G holds equity method investments in two partnerships involved in converting coal to synthetic fuel, the use of which fuel qualifies for federal income tax credits. The aggregate investment in these partnerships as of December 31, 2005 is $3.9 million, and through December 31, 2005, they have generated and passed through to SCE&G $188.3 million in tax credits. In a January 2005 order, the SCPSC approved SCE&Gs request to apply these tax credits, net of partnership losses and other expenses, to offset the construction costs of the Lake Murray Dam project. Under the accounting methodology approved by the SCPSC, construction costs related to the project were recorded in utility plant in service in a special dam remediation account outside of rate base, and depreciation is being recognized against the balance in this account on an accelerated basis, subject to the availability of the synthetic fuel tax credits. The level of depreciation expense and related income tax benefit recognized in the income statement is equal to the available synthetic fuel tax credits, less partnership losses and other expenses, net of taxes. As a result, the balance of unrecovered costs in the dam remediation account is declining as accelerated depreciation is recorded. Although these entries collectively have no impact on consolidated net income, they have a significant impact on individual line items within the income statement. Depreciation on the Lake Murray Dam remediation account will be matched to available synthetic fuel tax credits on a quarterly basis until the balance in the dam remediation account is zero or until all of the available synthetic fuel tax credits have been utilized. The synthetic fuel tax credit program expires at the end of 2007. The ability to utilize the synthetic fuel tax credits is dependent on several factors, one of which is the average annual domestic wellhead price per barrel of crude oil as published by the U.S. Government. Under a phase out provision included in the program, if the domestic wellhead reference price of oil per barrel for a given year is below an inflation adjusted benchmark range for that year, all of the synthetic fuel tax credits generated in that year would be available for use. If that price is above the benchmark range, none of the tax credits would be available. If that price falls within the benchmark range, a certain percentage of the credits would be available. While the benchmark price range for 2005 has been estimated at between $52 and $65 per barrel, the 2005 reference price will not be known until April 2006. However, SCE&Gs analysis indicates that the synthetic fuel tax credits recorded in 2005 should not be impacted by the phase out calculation. During 2006 and subject to continuing review of the estimated benchmark range and reference price of oil, the Company intends to continue to record synthetic fuel tax credits as they are generated and to apply those credits quarterly to allow the recording of accelerated depreciation related to the balance in the dam remediation project account. The Company cannot predict what impact, if any, the price of oil may have on the Companys ability to earn and utilize synthetic fuel tax credits in the future. However, the price volatility resulting from the disruptions in the oil and gas markets in the third quarter of 2005 raise significant uncertainty as to the continued availability of the credits in 2006 and 2007. The availability of these synthetic fuel tax credits is also subject to coal availability and other operational risks related to the generating plants. If it is determined that available credits are not sufficient to fully recover the construction costs of the dam remediation, regulatory action to allow recovery of those remaining costs may be sought. As of December 31, 2005, remaining unrecovered costs, based on managements recording of accelerated deprecation and related tax benefits on its assumption that 2005s credits will not be subjected to the phase out provisions, were $89.2 million. Finally, Primesouth, Inc., a subsidiary of SCANA, provides management and maintenance services for a non affiliated synthetic fuel production facility. Should synthetic fuel tax credit availability be curtailed under the above phase out provisions, the level of payment Primesouth receives for these services could be adversely impacted. Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated PSNC Energy is subject to the jurisdiction of the NCUC as to gas rates, issuance of securities (other than notes with a maturity of two years or less or renewals of notes with a maturity of six years or less), accounting and other matters. The U. S. Congress passed the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (the Pipeline Safety Act), directing the U. S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish a pipeline integrity management rule for operations of natural gas systems with transmission pipelines located near moderate to high density populations. Of PSNC Energys approximately 720 miles of transmission pipeline subject to the Pipeline Safety Act, approximately 110 miles are located within these areas. Fifty percent of these miles of pipeline must be assessed by December 2007, and the remainder by December 2012. Depending on the assessment method used, PSNC Energy will be required to reinspect these same miles of pipeline every five to seven years. Though cost estimates for this project were developed using various assumptions, each of which are subject to imprecision, PSNC Energy currently estimates the total cost to be $8 million for the initial assessments and any subsequent remediation required through December 2012. Effective November 1, 2004 the NCUC authorized the Company to defer for subsequent rate consideration certain expenses incurred to comply with DOTs pipeline integrity management requirements. 43 table of contents South Carolina Pipeline Corporation SCPC has approximately 51 miles of transmission line that are covered by the Integrity Management Rule of the Pipeline Safety Act. Though cost estimates for this project were developed using various assumptions, each of which are subject to imprecision, SCPC currently estimates the total cost to be $10 million for the initial assessments and any subsequent remediation required through December 2012. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Following are descriptions of the Companys accounting policies and estimates which are most critical in terms of reporting financial condition or results of operations. Utility Regulation SCANAs regulated utilities are subject to the provisions of SFAS 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, which require them to record certain assets and liabilities that defer the recognition of expenses and revenues to future periods as a result of being rate regulated. In the future, as a result of deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment, the Company may no longer meet the criteria for continued application of SFAS 71 and could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the Companys Electric Distribution and Gas Distribution segments in the period the write off would be recorded. It is not expected that cash flows or financial position would be materially affected. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the Companys regulatory assets and liabilities, including those associated with the Companys environmental assessment program. The Companys generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market. If market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs, the Company could be required to write down its investment in those assets. The Company cannot predict whether any write downs will be necessary and, if they are, the extent to which they would adversely affect the Companys results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded. As of December 31, 2005, the Companys net investments in fossil/hydro and nuclear generation assets were approximately $2.3 billion and $552 million, respectively. Revenue Recognition and Unbilled Revenues Revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers of the Companys utilities and retail gas operations are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual reading of their electric and gas meters, the Company records estimates for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. Such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to each customer since the date of the last reading of their respective meters. Such unbilled revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class, the effects of different rate schedules, changes in weather and, where applicable, the impact of weather normalization provisions of rate structures. The accrual of unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of $280.9 million and $213.0 million, respectively, compared to total revenues for 2005 and 2004 of $4.8 billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. Provisions for Bad Debts and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts As of each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and records allowances for doubtful accounts based on estimates of the level of expected write offs. These estimates are based on, among other things, comparisons of the relative age of accounts, assigned credit ratings for commercial and industrial accounts, and consideration of actual write off history. The distribution segments of the Companys regulated utilities have established write off histories and regulated service areas that enable the utilities to reliably estimate their respective provisions for bad debts. The Companys Retail Gas Marketing segment operates in Georgias deregulated natural gas market. As such, estimation of the provision for bad debts related to this segment is subject to greater imprecision. Nuclear Decommissioning Accounting for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future. Among the factors that could change SCE&Gs accounting estimates related to decommissioning costs are changes in technology, changes in regulatory and environmental remediation requirements, and changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and timing of cash flows. Changes in any of these estimates could significantly impact the Companys financial position and cash flows (although changes in such estimates should be earnings neutral, because these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers). 44 table of contents SCE&Gs share of estimated site specific nuclear decommissioning costs for Summer Station, including the cost of decommissioning plant components not subject to radioactive contamination, totals $357.3 million, stated in 1999 dollars. This estimate is based on a decommissioning study completed in 2000 which has not yet been updated to incorporate the 20 year license extension for Summer Station received in 2004. SCE&G expects to complete a new decommissioning study in 2006. Santee Cooper is responsible for decommissioning costs related to its one third ownership interest in the station. The cost estimate is based on a decommissioning methodology acceptable to the NRC under which the site would be maintained over a period of approximately 60 years in such a manner as to allow for subsequent decontamination that permits release for unrestricted use. Under SCE&Gs method of funding decommissioning costs, funds collected through rates are invested in insurance policies on the lives of certain Company personnel. Amounts for decommissioning collected through electric rates, insurance proceeds, and interest on proceeds, less expenses, are transferred by SCE&G to an external trust fund. Management intends for the fund, including earnings thereon, to provide for all eventual decommissioning expenditures on an after tax basis. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Company follows SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, in accounting for its defined benefit pension plan. The Companys plan is fully funded and as such, net pension income is reflected in the financial statements (see Results of Operations). SFAS 87 requires the use of several assumptions, the selection of which may have a large impact on the resulting benefit recorded. Among the more sensitive assumptions are those surrounding discount rates and expected returns on assets. Net pension income of $18.1 million recorded in 2005 reflects the use of a 5.75% discount rate and an assumed 9.25% long term rate of return on plan assets. The Company believes that these assumptions were, and that the resulting pension income amount was, reasonable. For purposes of comparison, using a discount rate of 5.5% in 2005 would have increased the Companys pension income by approximately $0.4 million. Had the assumed long term rate of return on assets been 9.0%, the Companys pension income for 2005 would have been reduced by approximately $2.1 million. In determining the appropriate discount rate for 2005, the Company considered the market indices of high quality long term fixed income securities and selected the discount rate of 5.75% as being within a reasonable range of interest rates for obligations rated Aa by Moodys as of January 1, 2005. For 2006, the discount rate to be used will be 5.6%, which was derived using a cash flow matching technique which the Company believes is preferable. The same discount rates were also selected for determination of other postemployment benefits costs discussed below. The following information with respect to pension assets (and returns thereon) should also be noted. The Company determines the fair value of substantially all of its pension assets utilizing market quotes rather than utilizing any calculated values, market related values or other modeling techniques. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumptions, the Company evaluates input from actuaries and from pension fund investment consultants. Such consultants 2005 review of the plans historical 10, 15, 20 and 25 year cumulative performance showed actual returns of 9.8%, 11.6%, 11.6% and 12.3%, respectively, all of which have been in excess of related broad indices. The 2005 expected long term rate of return of 9.25% was based on a target asset allocation of 70% with equity managers and 30% with fixed income managers. Management regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate. For 2006, the expected rate of return will be 9.0%. The pension trust is adequately funded, and no contributions have been required since 1997. Management does not anticipate the need to make pension contributions until after 2010. Similar to its pension accounting, the Company follows SFAS 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, in accounting for its postretirement medical and life insurance benefits. This plan is unfunded, so no assumptions related to rate of return on assets impact the net expense recorded; however, the selection of discount rates can significantly impact the actuarial determination of net expense. The Company used a discount rate of 5.75% and recorded a net SFAS 106 cost of $17.0 million for 2005. Had the selected discount rate been 5.50%, the expense for 2005 would have been $0.2 million higher. 45 table of contents Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143, together with FIN 47, provides guidance for recording and disclosing liabilities related to future legally enforceable obligations to retire assets (ARO). SFAS 143 applies to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of long lived tangible assets that result from their acquisition, construction, development and normal operation. Because such obligation relates primarily to the Companys regulated utility operations, adoption of SFAS 143 and FIN 47 had no significant impact on results of operations. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has recorded an ARO of approximately $132 million for nuclear plant decommissioning (as discussed above) and an ARO of approximately $191 million for other conditional obligations related to generation, transmission and distribution properties, including gas pipelines, which was recorded under FIN 47. All of the amounts recorded in connection with SFAS 143 and FIN 47 are based upon estimates which are subject to varying degrees of imprecision, particularly since such payments will be made many years in the future. Changes in these estimates will be recorded over time, but as stated above, these changes in estimates are not expected to materially impact results of operations so long as the regulatory framework for the Companys regulated utilities remains in place. OTHER MATTERS Off Balance Sheet Financing Although SCANA invests in securities and business ventures, it does not hold investments in unconsolidated special purpose entities such as those described in SFAS 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, or as described in Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. SCANA does not engage in off balance sheet financing or similar transactions, although it is party to incidental operating leases in the normal course of business, generally for office space, furniture and equipment. Claims and Litigation For a description of claims and litigation see Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. 46 table of contents ITEM 7A.

The above table excludes approximately $97 million and $94 million in long term debt as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which amounts do not have a stated interest rate associated with them. In December 2005, the Company entered into a $125 million treasury lock agreement at an initial interest rate of 4.72% which will terminate by August 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2005, the fair value of this treasury lock agreement was a loss of approximately $3.8 million. 47 table of contents Commodity Price Risk Commodity price risk The following table provides information about the Companys financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in natural gas prices.

See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. The NYMEX futures information above includes those financial positions of Energy Marketing, SCPC and PSNC Energy. Certain derivatives that SCPC utilizes to hedge its gas purchasing activities are recoverable through its weighted average cost of gas calculation. SCPCs tariffs include a purchased gas adjustment (PGA) clause that provides for the recovery of actual gas costs incurred. The offset to the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability. In a July 2005 order, in connection with SCPCs 2005 annual prudency review, the SCPSC determined that SCPCs gas costs, including all hedging activities, were reasonable and prudently incurred during the 12 month review period ended December 31, 2004. PSNC Energy utilizes NYMEX futures, options and swaps to hedge gas purchasing activities. PSNC Energys tariffs also include a provision for the recovery of actual gas costs incurred. PSNC Energy records transaction fees and any realized and unrealized gains or losses from derivatives acquired as part of its hedging program in deferred accounts as a regulatory asset or liability for the over or under recovery of gas costs. In a September 2005 order, in connection with PSNC Energys 2005 annual prudency review, the NCUC determined that PSNC Energys gas costs, including all hedging transactions, were reasonable and prudently incurred during the 12 month review period ended March 31, 2005. 48 table of contents 
 
ITEM 7.

The Company disclaims any obligation to update any forward looking statements. OVERVIEW SCE&G is a regulated public utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and in the purchase and sale, primarily at retail, of natural gas. SCE&Gs business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Generally, sales of electricity are higher during the summer and winter months because of air conditioning and heating requirements, and sales of natural gas are greater in the winter months due to heating requirements. SCE&Gs electric service area extends into 26 counties covering more than 17,000 square miles in the central, southern and southwestern portions of South Carolina. The service area for natural gas encompasses all or part of 34 of the 46 counties in South Carolina and covers more than 22,000 square miles. Key earnings drivers for SCE&G over the next five years will be additions to utility rate base, driven primarily by capital expenditures for environmental facilities, new generating capacity and system expansion. Other factors that will impact future earnings growth include the regulatory environment, customer growth, controlling interest expense through continued debt reduction and limiting the growth of operation and maintenance expenses. Electric Operations The electric operations segment is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, GENCO and Fuel Company, and is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in South Carolina. At December 31, 2005 SCE&G provided electricity to approximately 610,000 customers. GENCO owns and operates a coal fired generation station and sells electricity solely to SCE&G. Fuel Company acquires, owns and provides financing for SCE&Gs nuclear fuel, fossil fuel and sulfur dioxide emission allowance requirements. Both GENCO and Fuel Company are consolidated with SCE&G for financial reporting purposes. Operating results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for electricity, the ability to control costs and rates allowed to be charged to customers. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity. In January 2005, as a result of an electric rate case, SCE&Gs allowed return on equity was lowered from 12.45% to an amount not to exceed 11.4%, with rates set at 10.7%. See further discussion at Liquidity and Capital Resources. Demand for electricity is primarily affected by weather, customer growth and the economy. Legislative and regulatory initiatives, including the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the Energy Policy Act) also could significantly impact the results of operations and cash flows for the electric operations segment. The Energy Policy Act became law in August 2005, and it provides, among other things, for the establishment of an electric reliability organization (ERO) to propose and enforce mandatory reliability standards for transmission systems, for procedures governing enforcement actions by the ERO and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and for procedures under which the ERO may delegate authority to a regional entity to enforce reliability standards. In February 2006 FERC issued final rules to implement the electric reliability provisions of the Energy Policy Act. The Company is reviewing these rules and will monitor their implementation to determine the impact they may have on SCE&Gs access to or cost of power for its native load customers and for its marketing of power outside its service territory. The Company cannot predict when or if FERC will advance other regulatory initiatives related to the national energy market or what conditions such initiatives would impose on utilities. SCE&G: New legislation may also impose stringent requirements on power plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury. It is also possible that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The Company cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted, and if it is, the conditions it would impose on utilities. 85 table of contents Gas Distribution The gas distribution segment is comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G and is primarily engaged in the purchase and sale, primarily at retail, of natural gas in portions of South Carolina. At December 31, 2005 this segment provided natural gas to approximately 292,000 customers. Operating results for gas distribution are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas, the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity. This allowed return on equity was 12.25% for January 1 through October 31, 2005, when it was lowered to 10.25% as a result of a rate case. Demand for natural gas is primarily affected by weather, customer growth, the economy and, for commercial and industrial customers, the availability and price of alternate fuels. Natural gas competes with electricity, propane and heating oil to serve the heating and, to a lesser extent, other household energy needs of residential and small commercial customers. This competition is generally based on price and convenience. Large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel, such as propane or fuel oil. Natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price. As a result, any significant disparity between supply and demand, either of natural gas or of alternate fuels, and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors, will affect price and impact SCE&Gs ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers. Significant supply disruptions did occur in September and October 2005 as a result of hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in the curtailment during the period of most large commercial and industrial customers with interruptible supply agreements. While supply disruptions are no longer being experienced, the price of natural gas remains volatile and has resulted in short term competitive pressure. The long term impact of volatile gas prices has not been determined. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Income Net income was as follows: Millions of dollars 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Net income $ 258.1 11.0 % $ 232.5 4.6 % $ 222.2 2005 vs 2004 Net income increased primarily due to higher electric and gas margins of $50.8 million and $5.1 million, respectively, and due to the recognition of carrying cost recovery of $10.9 million on the dam remediation project (see further discussion at Recognition of Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits in Results of Operations). These increases were offset by higher major maintenance expenses of $4.1 million, higher depreciation and amortization expense of $16.1 million, increased interest expense of $3.3 million, increased expenses of $5.5 million associated with the Jasper County Electric Generation Station completed in May 2004, lower equity AFC of $14.3 million and higher other expenses of $2.3 million. 2004 vs 2003 Net income increased primarily due to higher electric margins of $62.2 million, partially offset by lower gas margins of $4.6 million, increased operations and maintenance expenses of $17.4 million, higher depreciation and amortization expense of $15.3 million, higher other taxes of $3.3 million and lower AFC of $3.5 million. Pension Income Pension income was recorded on SCE&Gs financial statements as follows: Millions of dollars 2005 2004 2003 Income Statement Impact: (Component of) reduction in employee benefit costs $ 5.6 $ 4.2 $ (1.0 ) Other income 12.2 11.0 8.2 Balance Sheet Impact: (Component of) reduction in capital expenditures 1.6 1.2 (0.3 ) Component of (reduction in) amount due to Summer Station co owner 0.6 0.4 (0.1 ) Total Pension Income $ 20.0 $ 16.8 $ 6.8 For the last several years, the market value of SCE&Gs retirement plan (pension) assets has exceeded the total actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits. Pension incomes significant increase in 2004 is consistent with overall investment market results. See also the discussion of pension accounting in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. 86 table of contents Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFC) AFC is a utility accounting practice whereby a portion of the cost of both equity and borrowed funds used to finance construction (which is shown on the balance sheet as construction work in progress) is capitalized. The Company includes an equity portion of AFC in nonoperating income and a debt portion of AFC in interest charges (credits) as noncash items, both of which have the effect of increasing reported net income. AFC represented approximately 1.5% of income before income taxes in 2005, 6.5% in 2004 and 8.4% in 2003. The lower level of AFC for 2005 is primarily due to reductions in the levels of capital expenditures subsequent to the completion of the Jasper County Electric Generation Station in May 2004 and completion of the Lake Murray Dam project in May 2005. Recognition of Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits SCE&G holds equity method investments in two partnerships involved in converting coal to synthetic fuel, the use of which fuel qualifies for federal income tax credits. These synthetic fuel production facilities were placed in operation in 2000 and 2001. Under an accounting plan approved by the SCPSC in June 2000, the synthetic fuel tax credits generated by the partnerships and passed through to SCE&G, net of partnership losses and other expenses, were deferred until the SCPSC approved its application to offset capital costs of the Lake Murray Dam project as described below. In a January 2005 order, the SCPSC approved SCE&Gs request to apply these synthetic fuel tax credits to offset the construction costs of the Lake Murray Dam project. Under the accounting methodology approved by the SCPSC, construction costs related to the project were recorded in utility plant in service in a special dam remediation account outside of rate base, and depreciation is being recognized against the balance in this account on an accelerated basis, subject to the availability of the synthetic fuel tax credits. The level of depreciation expense and related tax benefit recognized in the income statement is equal to the available synthetic fuel tax credits, less partnership losses and other expenses, net of taxes. As a result, the balance of unrecovered costs in the dam remediation account is declining as accelerated depreciation is recorded. Although these entries collectively have no impact on consolidated net income, they have a significant impact on individual line items within the income statement. In addition, SCE&G is allowed to record non cash carrying costs on the unrecovered investment. The accelerated depreciation, synthetic fuel tax credits, partnership losses and the income tax benefit arising from such losses recognized by SCE&G during 2005 are as follows: Recognized Year Ended Factors Increasing (Decreasing) Net Income 4th Quarter December 31, Millions of dollars 2005 2005 Depreciation and amortization expense $ (13.2 ) $ (214.0 ) Income tax benefits: From synthetic fuel tax credits 10.9 179.0 From accelerated depreciation 5.0 81.8 From partnership losses 1.7 28.9 Total income tax benefits 17.6 289.7 Losses from Equity Method Investments (4.4 ) (75.7 ) Impact on Net Income Dividends Declared SCE&Gs Board of Directors has declared the following dividends on common stock held by SCANA during 2005: Declaration Date Dividend Amount Quarter Ended Payment Date February 17, 2005 $38.0 million March 31, 2005 April 1, 2005 May 5, 2005 $38.0 million June 30, 2005 July 1, 2005 July 27, 2005 $38.0 million September 30, 2005 October 1, 2005 November 2, 2005 $38.0 million December 31, 2005 January 1, 2006 87 table of contents Electric Operations Electric Operations is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, GENCO and Fuel Company. Electric operations sales margins were as follows: Millions of dollars 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Operating revenues $ 1,912.0 13.0 % $ 1,692.0 15.0 % $ 1,471.7 Less: Fuel used in generation 618.1 32.4 % 466.9 39.7 % 334.1 Purchased power 37.2 (26.6 )% 50.7 (20.8 )% 64.0 Margin $ 1,256.7 7.0 % $ 1,174.4 9.4 % $ 1,073.6 2005 vs 2004 Margin increased by $41.4 million due to increased retail electric rates that went into effect in January 2005, by $24.8 million due to residential and commercial customer growth and by $16.4 million due to increased off system sales. These increases were offset by a $2.4 million decrease due to unfavorable weather. Fuel used in generation increased $151.2 million due primarily to the increased cost of coal and natural gas used for electric generation. Purchased power decreased due to greater availability of generation facilities. 2004 vs 2003 Margin increased by $47.2 million due to increased off system sales, by $22.9 million due to increased customer growth and consumption, by $22.3 million due to favorable weather and by $7.1 million due to the increase in retail electric base rates effective February 2003. Fuel used in generation increased by $103.0 million due to increased availability of generation facilities and by $30.0 million due to increased cost of coal. Purchased power decreased due to greater availability of generation facilities. MWh sales volumes by class, related to the electric margin above, were as follows: Classification (in thousands) 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Residential 7,634 2.3 % 7,460 6.6 % 6,998 Commercial 7,065 2.1 % 6,919 4.5 % 6,622 Industrial 6,651 (1.8 )% 6,775 3.5 % 6,548 Sales for resale (excluding interchange) 1,487 (2.5 )% 1,525 6.1 % 1,438 Other 527 0.2 % 526 5.2 % 500 Total territorial 23,364 0.7 % 23,205 5.0 % 22,106 NMST 1,794 (2.8 )% 1,845 * 425 Total 25,158 0.4 % 25,050 11.2 % 22,531 * Greater than 100% 2005 vs 2004 Territorial sales volumes increased by 407 MWh primarily due to customer growth partially offset by 261 MWh due to less favorable weather. 2004 vs 2003 Territorial sales volumes increased by 334 MWh and 774 MWh due to customer growth and weather, respectively. Gas Distribution Gas Distribution is comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G. Gas distribution sales margins (including transactions with affiliates) were as follows: Millions of dollars 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Operating revenues $ 508.8 28.0 % $ 397.4 10.4 % $ 360.1 Less: Gas purchased for resale 416.6 32.8 % 313.6 16.7 % 268.8 Margin $ 92.2 10.0 % $ 83.8 (8.2 )% $ 91.3 2005 vs 2004 Margin increased $4.7 million due to higher firm margin and $4.6 million due to increased retail gas base rates which became effective with the first billing cycle in November 2005. These increases were offset by a $0.8 million decrease due to lower interruptible margin and transportation revenue. 2004 vs 2003 Margin decreased primarily due to a decreased billing surcharge for the recovery of environmental remediation expenses of $5.0 million and lower residential and commercial sales volumes of $2.5 million. 88 table of contents DT sales volumes by class, including transportation gas, were as follows: Classification (in thousands) 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Residential 12,806 (0.9)% 12,916 (2.5)% 13,243 Commercial 12,553 3.3% 12,155 (1.4)% 12,322 Industrial 15,907 5.4% 15,087 3.9% 14,524 Transportation gas 2,032 (10.6)% 2,272 6.1% 2,141 Total 43,298 2.0% 42,430 0.5% 42,230 2005 vs 2004 Commercial and industrial volumes increased primarily due to more customers buying commodity gas instead of purchasing alternative fuels and instead of transporting gas purchased from others. 2004 vs 2003 Residential and commercial sales volumes decreased primarily due to unfavorable consumption patterns. Industrial and transportation volumes increased in 2004 primarily as a result of interruptible customers using gas instead of alternative fuels. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses, which arose from the operating segments previously discussed, were as follows: Millions of dollars 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Other operation and maintenance $ 441.2 2.4 % $ 431.0 7.0 % $ 402.9 Depreciation and amortization 464.8 * 220.9 12.6 % 196.2 Other taxes 131.0 (0.2 )% 131.3 4.2 % 126.0 Total $ 1,037.0 32.4 % $ 783.2 8.0 % $ 725.1 * Greater than 100% 2005 vs 2004 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to increased electric generation major maintenance expenses of $6.7 million, increased expenses associated with the Jasper County Electric Generating Station completed in May 2004 of $2.4 million, increased nuclear operating and maintenance expenses of $2.4 million, higher expenses related to regulatory matters of $1.9 million and higher amortization of regulatory assets of $3.6 million. The increases were offset primarily by decreased long term bonus and incentive plan expenses of $4.8 million and decreased storm damage expenses of $0.9 million. Depreciation and amortization increased approximately $214.0 million due to accelerated depreciation of the back up dam at Lake Murray (previously explained at Recognition of Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits), increased $6.5 million due to the completion of the Jasper County Electric Generating Station in May 2004 and $6.1 million due to normal net property changes. In addition, pursuant to the January 2005 rate order, SCE&G began amortization of previously deferred purchased power costs and implemented new depreciation rates, resulting in $17.3 million of additional depreciation and amortization expense in the period. 2004 vs 2003 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to increased labor and benefit expense of $19.5 million, $11.0 million of increased operating expenses at the electric generation plants and $2.5 million of expenses associated with winter storm restoration, partially offset by increased pension income of $5.2 million. Depreciation and amortization increased by $13.4 million due to completion of the Jasper County Electric Generating Station and $11.1 million due to normal additions. Other taxes increased primarily due to property taxes. Interest Expense Components of interest expense, excluding the debt component of AFC, were as follows: Millions of dollars 2005 % Change 2004 % Change 2003 Interest on long term debt, net $ 136.3 (5.9 )% $ 144.8 3.7 % $ 139.7 Other interest expense 11.0 * 3.5 (35.2 )% 5.4 Total $ 147.3 (0.7 )% $ 148.3 2.2 % $ 145.1 * Greater than 100% 2005 vs 2004 Interest on long term debt decreased primarily due to the redemption of outstanding debt. Other interest expense increased primarily due to increased short term debt. 89 table of contents 2004 vs 2003 Interest on long term debt increased primarily due to slightly higher levels of borrowing outstanding during 2004 until the payment of maturing debt late in the year. Income Taxes Income taxes decreased approximately $269.9 million for the year 2005 compared to 2004 and increased approximately $10.2 million for the year 2004 compared to 2003. Changes in income taxes are primarily due to changes in operating income, although in 2005 tax benefits of synthetic fuel credits of $179.0 were also recognized pursuant to the January 2005 electric rate order. SCE&Gs effective tax rate has been favorably impacted in recent years by the flow through of state investment tax credits and the equity portion of AFC. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companys cash requirements arise primarily from its operational needs, funding its construction programs and payment of dividends to SCANA. The ability of the Company to replace existing plant investment, as well as to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas, will depend upon its ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms. SCE&G recovers the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers. Rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs. As customer growth and inflation occur and SCE&G continues its ongoing construction program, SCE&G expects to seek increases in rates. The Companys future financial position and results of operations will be affected by SCE&Gs ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief, if requested. In a January 2005 order, the SCPSC granted SCE&G a composite increase in retail electric rates of 2.89%, designed to produce additional annual revenues of $41.4 million based on a test year calculation. The SCPSC lowered SCE&Gs allowed return on common equity from 12.45% to an amount not to exceed 11.4%, with rates set at 10.7%. The new rates became effective in January 2005. As part of its order, the SCPSC approved SCE&Gs recovery of construction and operating costs for SCE&Gs new Jasper County Electric Generating Station, recovery of costs of mandatory environmental upgrades primarily related to Federal Clean Air Act regulations and the application of current and anticipated net synthetic fuel tax credits to offset the cost of constructing the back up dam at Lake Murray. The SCPSC also approved recovery over a five year period of SCE&Gs approximately $14 million of costs incurred in the formation of the GridSouth Regional Transmission Organization and recovery through base rates over three years of $25.6 million of purchased power costs that were previously deferred. As a part of its order, the SCPSC extended through 2010 its approval of the accelerated capital recovery plan for SCE&Gs Cope Generating Station. Under the plan, in the event that SCE&G would otherwise earn in excess of its maximum allowed return on common equity, SCE&G may increase depreciation of its Cope Generating Station up to $36 million annually without additional approval of the SCPSC. Any unused portion of the $36 million in any given year may be carried forward for possible use in the immediately following year. No such additional depreciation was recognized in 2005, 2004 or 2003. In October 2005, the SCPSC granted SCE&G an overall increase of $22.9 million, or 5.69%, in retail gas base rates. The new rates are based on an allowed return on common equity of 10.25% and became effective with the first billing cycle in November 2005. SCE&G expects to require the addition of base load electrical generation by 2015 and is evaluating alternatives, including fossil and nuclear fueled generation. On February 10, 2006, SCE&G and Santee Cooper, a state owned utility in South Carolina (joint owners of Summer Station), announced their selection of the Summer Station site as the preferred site for a new nuclear plant should nuclear generation be considered the best alternative in the future. Due to the significant lead time required for construction of a nuclear plant, the joint owners are preparing an application to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a combined construction and operating license (COL). The COL application, which is expected to be completed and filed in 2007, would be reviewed by the NRC for an estimated three years. Issuance of a COL would not obligate the joint owners to build a nuclear plant. The final decision to build a nuclear plant will be influenced by several factors, including NRC licensing attainment, construction and operating costs, the cost of competing fuels, regulatory and environmental requirements and financial market conditions. 90 table of contents The Companys current estimates of its cash requirements for construction and nuclear fuel expenditures for 2006 2008, which are subject to continuing review and adjustment, are as follows: Estimated Cash Requirements 2006 2007 2008 Millions of dollars SCE&G: Electric Plant: Generation (including GENCO) $ 128 $ 86 $ 193 Transmission 50 44 46 Distribution 115 114 115 Other 18 11 14 Nuclear Fuel 27 25 5 Gas 27 26 31 Common 22 17 7 Other 2 Total $ 389 $ 323 $ 411 The Companys contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2005 are summarized as follows: Contractual Cash Obligations (Millions of dollars) Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Long term and short term debt (including interest and preferred stock) $ 4,421 $ 578 $ 489 $ 373 $ 2,981 Capital leases 2 1 1 Operating leases 44 13 30 1 Purchase obligations 95 86 6 3 Other commercial commitments 672 327 285 14 46 Total $ 5,234 $ 1,005 $ 811 $ 391 $ 3,027 Included in other commercial commitments are estimated obligations for coal and nuclear fuel purchases. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Included in purchase obligations are customary purchase orders under which SCE&G has the option to utilize certain vendors without the obligation to do so. SCE&G may terminate such obligations without penalty. The Company also has a legal obligation associated with the decommissioning and dismantling of Summer Station and other conditional asset retirement obligations that are not listed in the contractual cash obligations above. See Notes 1B and 1N to the consolidated financial statements. In addition to the contractual cash obligations above, SCANA sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan and an unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plan for retirees. The pension plan is adequately funded, and no further contributions are anticipated until after 2010. The Companys cash payments under the health care and life insurance benefit plan were $8.2 million in 2005, and such annual payments are expected to increase to the $10 $11 million range in the future. The Company anticipates that its contractual cash obligations will be met through internally generated funds, the incurrence of additional short term and long term indebtedness and capital contributions from its parent, SCANA. The Company expects that it has or can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet its projected cash requirements for the foreseeable future. 91 table of contents Cash outlays for 2006 (estimated) and 2005 (actual) for certain expenditures are as follows: 2006 2005 Millions of dollars Property additions and construction expenditures $ 368 $ 331 Nuclear fuel expenditures 18 18 Investments 18 18 Total $ 404 $ 367 Financing Limits and Related Matters The Companys issuance of various securities, including long term and short term debt, is subject to customary approval or authorization by regulatory bodies including the SCPSC and FERC. Financing programs currently utilized by the Company are as follows. At December 31, 2005, SCE&G and Fuel Company had available the following lines of credit and short term borrowings outstanding: Millions of dollars Lines of credit (total and unused): SCE&G and Fuel Company Committed (expires June 2010) $ 525 Uncommitted 78(a ) Short term borrowings outstanding: Commercial paper (270 or fewer days) $ 303.1 Weighted average interest rate 4.40 % (a) Lines of credit that either SCE&G or SCANA may use. SCE&Gs First and Refunding Mortgage Bond Indenture, dated January 1, 1945 (Old Mortgage) and covering substantially all of its properties, prohibits the issuance of additional bonds (Class A Bonds) unless net earnings (as therein defined) for 12 consecutive months out of the 18 months prior to the month of issuance are at least twice the annual interest requirements on all Class A Bonds to be outstanding (Bond Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Bond Ratio was 7.03. The Old Mortgage allows the issuance of Class A Bonds up to an additional principal amount equal to (i) 70% of unfunded net property additions (which unfunded net property additions certified to the trustee and other property eligible to be certified as property additions totaled approximately $2.0 billion at December 31, 2005), (ii) retirements of Class A Bonds (which retirement credits totaled $86.0 million at December 31, 2005), and (iii) cash on deposit with the Trustee. SCE&G is also subject to a bond indenture dated April 1, 1993 (New Mortgage) covering substantially all of its electric properties under which its future mortgage backed debt (New Bonds) will be issued. New Bonds are issued under the New Mortgage on the basis of a like principal amount of Class A Bonds issued under the Old Mortgage which have been deposited with the Trustee of the New Mortgage. At December 31, 2005 approximately $1.2 billion Class A Bonds were on deposit with the Trustee of the New Mortgage and are available to support the issuance of additional New Bonds. New Bonds will be issuable under the New Mortgage only if adjusted net earnings (as therein defined) for 12 consecutive months out of the 18 months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least twice the annual interest requirements on all outstanding bonds (including Class A Bonds) and New Bonds to be outstanding (New Bond Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2005, the New Bond Ratio was 6.76. SCE&Gs Restated Articles of Incorporation (the Articles) prohibit issuance of additional shares of preferred stock without the consent of the preferred shareholders unless net earnings (as therein defined) for the 12 consecutive months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least one and one half times the aggregate of all interest charges and preferred stock dividend requirements on all shares of preferred stock outstanding immediately after the proposed issue (Preferred Stock Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2005, the Preferred Stock Ratio was 2.12. The Articles also require the consent of a majority of the total voting power of SCE&Gs preferred stock before SCE&G may issue or assume any unsecured indebtedness if, after such issue or assumption, the total principal amount of all such unsecured indebtedness would exceed ten percent of the aggregate principal amount of all of SCE&Gs secured indebtedness and capital and surplus (the ten percent test). No such consent is required to enter into agreements for payment of principal, interest and premium for securities issued for pollution control purposes. At December 31, 2005 the ten percent test would have limited issuances of unsecured indebtedness to approximately $419.5 million. Unsecured indebtedness at December 31, 2005 totaled approximately $246.6 million, and was comprised of short term borrowings and the interest free borrowing discussed below. 92 table of contents In 2004 and 2005 SCE&G borrowed an aggregate $59 million available under an agreement with the South Carolina Transportation Infrastructure Bank (the Bank) and the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) that allows SCE&G to borrow funds from the Bank to construct a roadbed for SCDOT in connection with the Lake Murray Dam remediation project. Such borrowings are being repaid interest free over ten years from the initial borrowing. At December 31, 2005 SCE&G had $50.2 million outstanding under the agreement. Financing Cash Flows During 2005 the Company experienced net cash outflows related to financing activities of approximately $64 million primarily due to the payment of dividends to SCANA. In anticipation of the issuance of debt, the Company uses interest rate lock or similar agreements to manage interest rate risk. These arrangements are designated as cash flow hedges. As such, payments made upon termination of such agreements are amortized to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. In connection with the issuance of First Mortgage Bonds in May 2003, SCE&G paid $11.9 million upon the termination of a treasury lock agreement. In connection with the issuance of First Mortgage Bonds in December 2003, SCE&G paid $3.5 million upon the termination of a forward starting interest rate swap. In December 2005 SCE&G entered into a $125 million treasury lock agreement at an initial interest rate of 4.72% which will terminate by August 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2005, an unrealized loss on this treasury lock agreement in the amount of $3.8 million has been recorded within other regulatory assets. If there is a loss on the ultimate settlement of this swap, such loss will be amortized over the life of the debt to which it relates. For additional information on significant financing transactions, see Note 4 to the Companys consolidated financial statements. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Capital Expenditures For the three years ended December 31, 2005, the Companys capital expenditures for environmental control totaled $199.2 million. These expenditures were in addition to expenditures included in Other operation and maintenance expenses, which were $25.2 million, $21.3 million, and $29.0 million during 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. It is not possible to estimate all future costs related to environmental matters, but forecasts for capitalized environmental expenditures for the Company are $66.8 million for 2006 and $314.1 million for the four year period 2007 through 2010. These expenditures are included in the Companys construction program discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources, and include the matters discussed below. Electric Operations In March 2005 the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule known as the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). CAIR requires the District of Columbia and 28 states, including South Carolina, to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in order to attain mandated state levels. SCE&G has petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review CAIR. Several other electric utilities have filed separate petitions. The petitioners seek a change in the method CAIR uses to allocate sulfur dioxide emission allowances to a method the petitioners believe is more equitable. The Company will be installing additional air quality controls to meet the CAIR requirements. Installation and operation and maintenance costs are currently being determined. Such costs are likely to be material and are expected to be recoverable through rates. In March 2005 the EPA issued a final rule establishing a mercury emissions cap and trade program for coal fired power plants that requires limits to be met in two phases, in 2010 and 2018. The Company is negotiating with the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control the terms of the state compliance proposals. Installation of additional air quality controls is likely to be required to comply with the mercury rules emission caps. Compliance plans and costs to comply with the rule will be determined once the Company completes its review and assessments. Such costs are likely to be material and are expected to be recoverable through rates. 93 table of contents The EPA has undertaken an aggressive enforcement initiative against the utilities industry, and the DOJ has brought suit against a number of utilities in federal court alleging violations of the CAA. At least two of these suits have either been tried or have had substantive motions decidedone favorable to the industry and one not. The one not favorable to the Company is not binding as precedent and the one favorable to the Company likely is precedent and is consistent with current Company interpretation of the law and its resulting maintenance practices. Prior to the suits, those utilities had received requests for information under Section 114 of the CAA and were issued Notices of Violation. The basis for these suits is the assertion by the EPA, under a stringent rule known as New Source Review (NSR), that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities over the past 20 or more years constitute major modifications which would have required the installation of costly Best Available Control Technology (BACT). SCE&G and GENCO have received and responded to Section 114 requests for information related to Canadys, Wateree and Williams Stations. The regulations under the CAA provide certain exemptions to the definition of major modifications, including an exemption for routine repair, replacement or maintenance. On October 27, 2003 EPA published a final revised NSR rule in the Federal Register with an effective date of December 26, 2003. The new rule represents an industry favorable departure from certain positions advanced by the federal government in the NSR enforcement initiative. However, on motion of several Northeastern states, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stayed the effect of the final rule. The ultimate application of the final rule to the Company is uncertain. The Company has analyzed each of the activities covered by the EPAs requests and believes each of these activities is covered by the exemption for routine repair, replacement and maintenance under what it believes is a fair reading of both the prior regulation and the contested revised regulation. The regulations also provide an exemption for an increase in emissions resulting from increased hours of operation or production rate and from demand growth. The current state of continued DOJ enforcement actions is the subject of industry wide speculation, but it is possible that the EPA will commence enforcement actions against SCE&G and GENCO, and the EPA has the authority to seek penalties at the rate of up to $27,500 per day for each violation. The EPA also could seek installation of BACT (or equivalent) at the three plants. The Company believes that any enforcement actions relative to the Companys, SCE&Gs or GENCOs compliance with the CAA would be without merit. The Company has completed installation of selective catalytic reactors at Wateree and Williams for nitrogen oxides control and is proceeding with plans to install sulfur dioxide scrubbers at both of these stations to meet CAIR regulations. These actions would mitigate many of the concerns with NSR. SCE&G and GENCO expect to incur capital expenditures totaling approximately $331 million over the 2006 2009 period to install this new equipment. SCE&G and GENCO expect to have increased operation and maintenance costs of approximately $4 million in 2009 and $27 million in 2010 and subsequent years. To meet compliance requirements for the years 2011 through 2015, the Company anticipates additional capital expenditures totaling approximately $564 million. The Clean Water Act, as amended, provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require treatment for wastewater discharges. Under the Clean Water Act, compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program. Discharge permits have been issued for all, and renewed for nearly all, of SCE&Gs and GENCOs generating units. Concurrent with renewal of these permits, the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program of monitoring and controlling discharges, has modified the requirements for cooling water intake structures, and has required strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams. The Company is conducting studies and is developing or implementing compliance plans for these initiatives. Congress is expected to consider further amendments to the Clean Water Act. Such legislation may include limitations to mixing zones and toxicity based standards. These provisions, if passed, could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. Nuclear Fuel Disposal The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (the Nuclear Waste Act)required that the United States government, by January 31, 1998, accept and permanently dispose of high level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. The Nuclear Waste Act also imposes on utilities the primary responsibility for storage of their spent nuclear fuel until the repository is available. SCE&G entered into a Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and or High Level Radioactive Waste (Standard Contract) with the DOE in 1983 providing for permanent disposal of its spent nuclear fuel in exchange for agreed payments fixed in the Standard Contract at particular amounts. On January 28, 2004 SCE&G and Santee Cooper (one third owner of Summer Station) filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims against the DOE for breach of the Standard Contract, because as of the date of filing, the federal government had accepted no spent fuel from Summer Station or any other utility for transport and disposal, and has indicated that it does not anticipate doing so until 2010, at the earliest. As a consequence of the federal governments breach of contract, the plaintiffs have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs. On January 9, 2006 SCE&G and Santee Cooper accepted a settlement from DOE which requires the payment by DOE of $9 million to the plaintiffs. The payment is to reimburse the plaintiffs for certain costs incurred from January 31, 1998 through July 31, 2005. SCE&G will record its portion ($6 million) of the settlement as a reduction to its fuel costs. As a result, most of the credit will be passed through to its customers through the fuel clause component of its retail electric rates. The settlement also provides for the plaintiffs to submit an annual application to DOE for the reimbursement of certain costs incurred subsequent to July 31, 2005. SCE&G has on site spent nuclear fuel storage capability until at least 2018 and expects to be able to expand its storage capacity to accommodate the spent nuclear fuel output for the life of the plant through dry cask storage or other technology as it becomes available. 94 table of contents Gas Distribution The Company maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could require environmental cleanup. As site assessments are initiated, estimates are made of the amount of expenditures, if any, deemed necessary to investigate and clean up each site. These estimates are refined as additional information becomes available; therefore, actual expenditures may differ significantly from the original estimates. Amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and cleanup relate solely to regulated operations and are recorded in deferred debits and amortized with recovery provided through rates. Deferred amounts, net of amounts previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements, totaled $17.7 million and $10.5 million at December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively. The deferral includes the estimated costs associated with the following matters: 95 table of contents SCE&G owns a decommissioned MGP site in the Calhoun Park area of Charleston, South Carolina. The site is currently being remediated for contamination. SCE&G anticipates that the remaining remediation activities will be completed by mid 2006, with certain monitoring and retreatment activities continuing until 2011. As of December 31, 2005, SCE&G has spent approximately $21.5 million to remediate the Calhoun Park site, and expects to spend an additional $0.3 million. In addition, the National Park Service of the Department of the Interior made an initial demand to SCE&G for payment of $9.1 million for certain costs and damages relating to this site. Any cost arising from this matter is expected to be recoverable through rates. SCE&G owns three other decommissioned MGP sites in South Carolina which contain residues of by product chemicals. One of the sites has been remediated and will undergo routine monitoring until released by DHEC. The other sites are currently being investigated under work plans approved by DHEC. SCE&G anticipates that major remediation activities for the three sites will be completed in 2010. As of December 31, 2005, SCE&G has spent approximately $4.5 million related to these three sites, and expects to spend an additional $11.5 million. Any cost arising from this matter is expected to be recoverable through rates. SCE&G has been named, along with 27 others, by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at the Carolina Transformer Superfund site located in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The Carolina Transformer Company (CTC) conducted an electrical transformer rebuilding and repair operation at the site from 1967 to 1984. During that time, SCE&G occasionally used CTC for the repair of existing transformers and the purchase of new transformers. In 1984, EPA initiated a cleanup of PCB contaminated soil and groundwater at the site. EPA reports that it has spent $36 million to date. SCE&Gs records indicated that only minimal quantities of used transformers were shipped by it to CTC, and it is not clear if any contained PCB contaminated oil. Although a basis for the allocation of clean up costs among the 28 PRPs is unclear, SCE&G does not believe that its involvement at this site would result in an allocation of costs that would have a material adverse impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Any cost arising from this matter is expected to be recoverable through rates. REGULATORY MATTERS See earlier discussion of increases in retail electric and gas base rates during 2005 in Liquidity and Capital Resources. In February 2005, the Natural Gas Stabilization Act of 2005 (Stabilization Act) became law in South Carolina. The Stabilization Act allows natural gas distribution companies to request annual adjustments to rates to reflect changes in revenues and expenses and changes in investment. Such annual adjustments are subject to certain qualifying criteria and review by the SCPSC. Synthetic Fuel SCE&G holds equity method investments in two partnerships involved in converting coal to synthetic fuel, the use of which fuel qualifies for federal income tax credits. The aggregate investment in these partnerships as of December 31, 2005 is approximately $3.9 million, and through December 31, 2005, they have generated and passed through to SCE&G approximately $188.3 million in tax credits. In a January 2005 order, the SCPSC approved SCE&Gs request to apply these tax credits, net of partnership losses and other expenses to offset the construction costs of the Lake Murray Dam project. Under the accounting methodology approved by the SCPSC, construction costs related to the project were recorded in utility plant in service in a special dam remediation account outside of rate base, and depreciation is being recognized against the balance in this account on an accelerated basis, subject to the availability of the synthetic fuel tax credits. The level of depreciation expense and related income tax benefit recognized in the income statement is equal to the available synthetic fuel tax credits, less partnership losses and other expenses, net of taxes. As a result, the balance of unrecovered costs in the dam remediation account is declining as accelerated depreciation is recorded. Although these entries collectively have no impact on consolidated net income, they have a significant impact on individual line items within the income statement. Depreciation on the Lake Murray Dam remediation account will be matched to available synthetic fuel tax credits on a quarterly basis until the balance in the dam remediation account is zero or until all of the available synthetic fuel tax credits have been utilized. The synthetic fuel tax credit program expires at the end of 2007. The ability to utilize the synthetic fuel tax credits is dependent on several factors, one of which is the average annual domestic wellhead price per barrel of crude oil as published by the U.S. Government. Under a phase out provision included in the program, if the domestic wellhead reference price of oil per barrel for a given year is below an inflation adjusted benchmark range for that year, all of the synthetic fuel tax credits that have been generated in that year would be available for use. If that price is above the benchmark range, none of the tax credits would be available. If that price falls within the benchmark range, a certain percentage of the credits would be available. While the benchmark price range for 2005 has been estimated at between $52 and $65 per barrel, the 2005 reference price will not be known until April 2006. However, SCE&Gs analysis indicates that the synthetic fuel tax credits recorded in 2005 should not be impacted by the phase out calculation. During 2006 and subject to continuing review of the estimated benchmark range and reference price of oil, the Company intends to continue to record synthetic fuel tax credits as they are generated and to apply those credits quarterly to allow the recording of accelerated depreciation related to the balance in the dam remediation project account. The Company cannot predict what impact, if any, the price of oil may have on the Companys ability to earn and utilize synthetic fuel tax credits in the future. However, the price volatility resulting from the disruptions in the oil and gas markets in the third quarter of 2005 raise significant uncertainty as to the continued availability of the credits in 2006 and 2007. The availability of these synthetic fuel tax credits is also subject to coal availability and other operational risks related to the generating plants. If it is determined that available credits are not sufficient to fully recover the construction costs of the dam remediation, regulatory action to allow recovery of those remaining costs may be sought. As of December 31, 2005, remaining unrecovered costs, based on managements recording of accelerated deprecation and related tax benefits on its assumption that 2005s credits will not be subjected to the phase out provisions, were $89.2 million. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Following are descriptions of the Companys accounting policies which are new or most critical in terms of reporting financial condition or results of operations. Utility Regulation The Company is subject to the provisions of SFAS 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, which requires it to record certain assets and liabilities that defer the recognition of expenses and revenues to future periods as a result of being rate regulated. In the future, as a result of deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment, the Company may no longer meet the criteria for continued application of SFAS 71 and could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the Companys Electric Distribution and Gas Distribution segments in the period the write off would be recorded. It is not expected that cash flows or financial position would be materially affected. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the Companys regulatory assets and liabilities, including those associated with the Companys environmental assessment program. The Companys generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market. If market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs, the Company could be required to write down its investment in those assets. The Company cannot predict whether any write downs will be necessary and, if they are, the extent to which they would adversely affect the Companys results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded. As of December 31, 2005, the Companys net investments in fossil/hydro and nuclear generation assets were $2.3 billion and $552 million, respectively. Revenue Recognition and Unbilled Revenues Revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual reading of their electric and gas meters, the Company records estimates for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. Such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to each customer since the date of the last reading of their respective meters. Such unbilled revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class, the effects of different rate schedules, changes in weather and, where applicable, the impact of weather normalization provisions of rate structures. The accrual of unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs. As of December 31, 2005 and 2004, accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of $99.7 million and $80.6 million, respectively, compared to total revenues for 2005 and 2004 of $2.4 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively. 96 table of contents Nuclear Decommissioning Accounting for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future. Among the factors that could change the Companys accounting estimates related to decommissioning costs are changes in technology, changes in regulatory and environmental remediation requirements, as well as changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and timing of cash flows. Changes in any of these estimates could significantly impact the Companys financial position and cash flows (although changes in such estimates should be earnings neutral, because these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers). The Companys share of estimated site specific nuclear decommissioning costs for Summer Station, including the cost of decommissioning plant components not subject to radioactive contamination, totals approximately $357 million, stated in 1999 dollars. This estimate is based on a decommissioning study completed in 2000 which has not yet been updated to incorporate the 20 year license extension for Summer Station received in 2004. SCE&G expects to complete a new decommissioning study in 2006. Santee Cooper is responsible for decommissioning costs related to its one third ownership interest in the station. The cost estimate is based on a decommissioning methodology acceptable to the NRC under which the site would be maintained over a period of approximately 60 years in such a manner as to allow for subsequent decontamination that permits release for unrestricted use. Under the Companys method of funding decommissioning costs, funds collected through rates are invested in insurance policies on the lives of certain Company and affiliate personnel. Amounts for decommissioning collected through electric rates, insurance proceeds, and interest on proceeds, less expenses, are transferred by SCE&G to an external trust fund. Management intends for the fund, including earnings thereon, to provide for all eventual decommissioning expenditures on an after tax basis. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits SCANA follows SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, in accounting for its defined benefit pension plan. SCANAs plan is fully funded and as such, net pension income is reflected in the financial statements (see Results of Operations). SFAS 87 requires the use of several assumptions, the selection of which may have a large impact on the resulting benefit recorded. Among the more sensitive assumptions are those surrounding discount rates and expected returns on assets. Net pension income of $20.0 million recorded in 2005 reflects the use of a 5.75% discount rate and an assumed 9.25% long term rate of return on plan assets. SCANA believes that these assumptions were, and that the resulting pension income amount was, reasonable. For purposes of comparison, using a discount rate of 5.5% in 2005 would have increased the Companys share of SCANAs pension income approximately $0.5 million. Had the assumed long term rate of return on assets been 9.0%, the Companys share of SCANAs pension income for 2005 would have been reduced by approximately $2.0 million. In determining the appropriate discount rate for 2005, SCANA considered the market indices of high quality long term fixed income securities and SCANA selected the discount rate of 5.75% as being within a reasonable range of interest rates for obligations rated Aa by Moodys as of January 1, 2005. For 2006, the discount rate to be used will be 5.6%, which was derived using a cash flow matching technique which SCANA believes is preferable. The same discount rates were also selected for determination of other postemployment benefits costs discussed below. The following information with respect to pension assets (and returns thereon) should also be noted. SCANA determines the fair value of substantially all of its pension assets utilizing market quotes rather than utilizing any calculated values, market related values or other modeling techniques. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumptions, SCANA evaluates input from actuaries and from pension fund investment consultants. Such consultants 2005 review of the plans historical 10, 15, 20 and 25 year cumulative performance showed actual returns of 9.8%, 11.6%, 11.6% and 12.3%, respectively, all of which have been in excess of related broad indices. The 2005 expected long term rate of return of 9.25% was based on a target asset allocation of 70% with equity managers and 30% with fixed income managers. Management regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate. For 2006, the expected rate of return will be 9.0%. The pension trust is adequately funded, and no contributions have been required since 1997. Management does not anticipate the need to make pension contributions until after 2010. Similar to its pension accounting, SCANA follows SFAS 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, in accounting for its postretirement medical and life insurance benefits. This plan is unfunded, so no assumptions related to rate of return on assets impact the net expense recorded; however, the selection of discount rates can significantly impact the actuarial determination of net expense. SCANA used a discount rate of 5.75% and recorded a net SFAS 106 cost of $12.3 million for 2005. Had the selected discount rate been 5.50%, the expense for 2005 would have been approximately $0.2 million higher. 97 table of contents Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143, together with FIN 47, provides guidance for recording and disclosing liabilities related to future legally enforceable obligations to retire assets (ARO). SFAS 143 applies to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of long lived tangible assets that result from their acquisition, construction, development and normal operation. Because such obligation relates to the Companys regulated utility operations, adoption of SFAS 143 and FIN 47 had no impact on results of operations. As of December 31, 2005, the Company has recorded an ARO of approximately $132 million for nuclear plant decommissioning (as discussed above) and an ARO of approximately $178 million for other conditional obligations related to generation, transmission and distribution properties, including gas pipelines, which was recorded under FIN 47. All of the amounts recorded in connection with SFAS 143 and FIN 47 are based upon estimates which are subject to varying degrees of imprecision, particularly since such payments will be made in many years in the future. Changes in these estimates will be recorded over time, but as stated above, these changes in estimates are not expected to materially impact results of operations so long as the regulatory framework for the Companys regulated utilities remains in place. OTHER MATTERS Off Balance Sheet Financing SCE&G does not hold investments in unconsolidated special purpose entities such as those described in SFAS 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, or as described in Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation 46, Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. SCE&G does not engage in off balance sheet financing or similar transactions, although it is party to incidental operating leases in the normal course of business, generally for office space, furniture and equipment. Claims and Litigation For a description of claims and litigation see Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All financial instruments held by SCE&G described below are held for purposes other than trading. Interest rate risk The tables below provide information about long term debt issued by SCE&G which is sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Fair values for debt represent quoted market prices. Expected Maturity Date December 31, 2005 Millions of dollars 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Fair Value Liabilities Long Term Debt: Fixed Rate ($) 169.9 39.2 39.2 139.2 39.2 1,714.4 2,141.1 2,051.3 Average Interest Rate (%) 8.51 6.86 6.86 6.33 6.86 5.88 6.17 Expected Maturity Date December 31, 2004 Millions of dollars 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 Thereafter Total Fair Value Liabilities Long Term Debt: Fixed Rate ($) 189.2 169.9 39.2 39.2 139.2 1,718.2 2,294.9 2,285.7 Average Interest Rate (%) 7.37 8.51 6.86 6.86 6.33 6.02 6.36 While a decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt, it is unlikely that events which would result in a realized loss will occur. The above table excludes approximately $97 million and $81 million in long term debt as of December 31, 2005 and 2004, respectively, which amounts do not have a stated interest rate associated with them. In December 2005 the Company entered into a $125 million treasury lock agreement at an initial interest rate of 4.72% which will terminate by August 31, 2006. As of December 31, 2005 the fair value of this treasury lock agreement was a loss of $3.8 million. 98 table of contents
