ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW SCANA, through its wholly owned regulated subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in parts of South Carolina and the purchase, transmission and sale of natural gas in portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. Through a wholly owned nonregulated subsidiary, SCANA markets natural gas to retail customers in Georgia and to wholesale customers primarily in the southeast. Other wholly owned nonregulated subsidiaries perform power plant management and maintenance services, provide fiber optic and other telecommunications services, and provide service contracts to homeowners on certain home appliances and heating and air conditioning units. Additionally, a service company subsidiary of SCANA provides administrative, management and other services to the other subsidiaries. The following map indicates areas where the Companys significant business segments conducted their activities, as further described in this overview section. Table of Contents The following percentages reflect revenues and net income earned by the Companys regulated and nonregulated businesses and the percentage of total assets held by them. % of Revenues 2006 2005 2004 Regulated 69 % 69 % 71 % Nonregulated 31 % 31 % 29 % % of Net Income (Loss) 2006(b ) 2005 2004(a ) Regulated 89 % 92 % 106 % Nonregulated 11 % 8 % (6 )% % of Assets 2006 2005 2004 Regulated 93 % 94 % 94 % Nonregulated 7 % 6 % 6 % (a) In 2004, net income for regulated businesses totaled $272.0 million and net loss for nonregulated businesses totaled $14.9 million. Net loss for nonregulated businesses included impairments and losses ($29.8 million, net of tax) recognized on the sale of certain of the Companys telecommunications investments and a charge ($11.1 million, net of taxes) related to pending litigation associated with the Companys 1999 sale of its propane assets. (b) In 2006, net income for non regulated businesses included a reduction of the litigation accrual referred to above upon the settlement of that litigation. See Results of Operations for more information. Key earnings drivers for the Company over the next five years will be additions to utility rate base at South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G) and Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated (PSNC Energy), consisting primarily of capital expenditures for environmental facilities, new generating capacity and system expansion. Other factors that will impact future earnings growth include the regulatory environment, customer growth in each of the regulated utility businesses, consistent earnings growth in the natural gas marketing business in Georgia and controlling the growth of operation and maintenance expenses. Electric Operations The electric operations segment is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, South Carolina Generating Company, Inc (GENCO) and South Carolina Fuel Company, Inc. (Fuel Company), and is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in South Carolina. At December 31, 2006 SCE&G provided electricity to 623,400 customers in an area covering nearly 17,000 square miles. GENCO owns and operates a coal fired generation station and sells electricity solely to SCE&G. Fuel Company acquires, owns and provides financing for SCE&Gs nuclear fuel, fossil fuel and emission allowance requirements. Operating results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for electricity, the ability to control costs and rates allowed to be charged to customers. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity. SCE&Gs allowed return on equity is not to exceed 11.4%, with rates set at 10.7%. Demand for electricity is primarily affected by weather, customer growth and the economy. SCE&G is able to recover the cost of fuel used in electric generation through retail customers bills, but increases in fuel costs affect electric prices and, therefore, the competitive position of electricity against other energy sources. Legislative and regulatory initiatives, including the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the Energy Policy Act) also could significantly impact the results of operations and cash flows for the electric operations segment. The Energy Policy Act became law in August 2005, and it provides, among other things, for the establishment of an electric reliability organization (ERO) to propose and enforce mandatory reliability standards for transmission systems, for procedures governing enforcement actions by the ERO and FERC and for procedures under which the ERO may delegate authority to a regional entity to enforce reliability standards. In February 2006 FERC issued final rules to implement the electric reliability provisions of the Energy Policy Act. The Company is reviewing these rules and monitoring their implementation to determine the impact they may have on SCE&Gs access to or cost of power for its native load customers and for its marketing of power outside its service territory. The Company cannot predict when or if FERC will advance other regulatory initiatives related to the national energy market or what conditions such initiatives would impose on utilities. New legislation may also impose stringent requirements on power plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury. It is also possible that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The Company cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted, and if it is, the conditions it would impose on utilities. Gas Distribution The gas distribution segment is comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G and PSNC Energy, and is primarily engaged in the purchase, transmission and sale of natural gas to retail customers in portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. At December 31, 2006 this segment provided natural gas to 738,500 customers in areas covering 35,000 square miles. Operating results for gas distribution are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas, the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity. Demand for natural gas is primarily affected by weather, customer growth, the economy and, for commercial and industrial customers, the availability and price of alternate fuels. Natural gas competes with electricity, propane and heating oil to serve the heating and, to a lesser extent, other household energy needs of residential and small commercial customers. This competition is generally based on price and convenience. Large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel, such as propane or fuel oil. Natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price. As a result, any significant disparity between supply and demand, either of natural gas or of alternate fuels, and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors, will affect price and impact the Companys ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers. Significant supply disruptions did occur in September and October 2005 as a result of hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in the curtailment during the period of most large commercial and industrial customers with interruptible supply agreements. While supply disruptions were not experienced in 2006 or in January or February of 2007, the price of natural gas remains volatile and has resulted in short term competitive pressure. The long term impact of volatile gas prices and gas supply has not been determined. Gas Transmission Effective November 1, 2006, SCG Pipeline merged into SCPC, and the merged company changed its name to Carolina Gas Transmission Corporation (CGTC). CGTC operates an open access, transportation only interstate pipeline company regulated by FERC. CGTCs operating results are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas, the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers. Demand for CGTCs services is closely linked to demand for natural gas and is affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth. CGTC provides transportation services to SCE&G for its gas distribution customers and for certain electric generation needs and to SCANA Energy Marketing, Inc. (SEMI) for natural gas marketing. CGTC also provides transportation services to other natural gas utilities, municipalities and county gas authorities and to industrial customers. Prior to the merger, the gas transmission segment was comprised solely of SCPC, which owned and operated an intrastate pipeline engaged in the purchase, transmission and sale of natural gas on a wholesale basis to distribution companies (including SCE&G) and industrial customers throughout most of South Carolina. SCPCs operating results were primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas, the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers. Retail Gas Marketing SCANA Energy, a division of SEMI, comprises the retail gas marketing segment. This segment markets natural gas to over 475,000 customers (as of December 31, 2006) throughout Georgia. SCANA Energys total customer base represents over a 30% share of the approximately 1.5 million customers in Georgias deregulated natural gas market. SCANA Energy remains the second largest natural gas marketer in the state. SCANA Energys competitors include affiliates of other large energy companies with experience in Georgias energy market as well as several electric membership cooperatives. SCANA Energys ability to maintain its market share depends on the prices it charges customers relative to the prices charged by its competitors, its ability to continue to provide high levels of customer service and other factors. In addition, the pipeline capacity available for Energy Marketing to serve industrial and other customers is tied to the market share held by SCANA Energy in the retail market. As Georgias regulated provider, SCANA Energy serves low income customers and customers unable to obtain or maintain natural gas service from other marketers at rates approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission (GPSC), and it receives funding from the Universal Service Fund for some of the bad debt associated with the low income group. SCANA Energys service as Georgias regulated provider of natural gas ends August 31, 2007. In February 2007, the GPSC initiated a request for proposal (RFP) bidding process which may be used to select a regulated provider for a new term. Notwithstanding that process, in which SCANA Energy is expected to participate, the GPSC may elect to extend SCANA Energys current contract term by one year. SCANA Energy files financial and other information periodically with the GPSC, and such information is available at www.psc.state.ga.us. At December 31, 2006, SCANA Energys regulated division served over 90,000 customers. SCANA Energy and SCANAs other natural gas distribution and marketing segments maintain gas inventory and also utilize forward contracts and financial instruments, including futures contracts and options, to manage their exposure to fluctuating commodity natural gas prices. See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. As a part of this risk management process, at any given time, a portion of SCANAs projected natural gas needs has been purchased or otherwise placed under contract. Since SCANA Energy operates in a competitive market, it may be unable to sustain its current levels of customers and or pricing, thereby reducing expected margins and profitability. Further, there can be no assurance that Georgias gas delivery regulatory framework will remain unchanged as dynamic market conditions evolve. Energy Marketing The divisions of SEMI, excluding SCANA Energy, comprise the energy marketing segment. This segment markets natural gas primarily in the southeast and provides energy related risk management services to producers and customers. The operating results for energy marketing are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas and the ability to control costs. Demand for natural gas is primarily affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The Companys reported earnings are determined in accordance with GAAP. Management believes that, in addition to reported earnings under GAAP, the Companys GAAP adjusted net earnings from operations provides a meaningful representation of its fundamental earnings power and can aid in performing period over period financial analysis and comparison with peer group data. In managements opinion, GAAP adjusted net earnings from operations is a useful indicator of the financial results of the Companys primary businesses. This measure is also a basis for managements provision of earnings guidance and growth projections, and it is used by management in making resource allocation and other budgetary and operational decisions. This non GAAP performance measure is not intended to replace the GAAP measure of net earnings, but is offered as a supplement to it. A reconciliation of reported (GAAP) earnings per share to GAAP adjusted net earnings from operations per share, as well as cash dividend information, is provided in the table below: 2006 2005 2004 Reported (GAAP) earnings per share $ 2.68 $ 2.81 $ 2.30 Add (Deduct): Cumulative effect of accounting change, net of tax (.05 ) Charge (reduction in charge) related to propane litigation (.04 ) .10 Gains from sales of telecommunications investments (.03 ) Losses from sales of telecommunications investments .14 Telecommunications investment impairments .13 GAAP adjusted net earnings from operations per share $ 2.59 $ 2.78 $ 2.67 Cash dividends declared (per share) $ 1.68 $ 1.56 $ 1.46 Discussion of above adjustments: The cumulative effect of an accounting change in 2006 resulted from the Companys adoption of Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (SFAS) 123 (revised 2004), Share Based Payment (SFAS 123(R)). The charge related to propane litigation recognized in 2004 resulted from an unfavorable verdict in a case in which an unsuccessful bidder for the purchase of certain of the Companys propane gas assets in 1999 alleged breach of contract and related claims. The litigation was settled in 2006 for an amount that was less than had been previously accrued. See also Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Realized gains in 2005 and realized losses in 2004 were recognized on sales of telecommunications investments. Unrealized impairments on certain of these investments were recognized in 2004. All significant telecommunications investments have now been monetized. Table of Contents Management believes that all of the above adjustments are appropriate in determining the non GAAP financial performance measure. Management utilizes such measure itself in exercising budgetary control, managing business operations and determining eligibility for certain incentive compensation payments. Such non GAAP measure is based on managements decision that the passive telecommunications investments were not a part of the Companys core businesses and would not be available to provide earnings on a long term basis. The non GAAP measure also provides a consistent basis upon which to measure performance by excluding the effects on per share earnings of transactions involving the Companys telecommunications investments and the litigation charge (and reduction) related to the sale of a prior business. Pension Income Pension income was recorded on the Companys financial statements as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 2005 2004 Income Statement Impact: Reduction in employee benefit costs $ 0.7 $ 4.3 $ 2.9 Other income 12.3 11.9 10.8 Balance Sheet Impact: Reduction in capital expenditures 0.3 1.3 1.0 Component of amount due to Summer Station co owner 0.2 0.6 0.4 Total Pension Income $ 13.5 $ 18.1 $ 15.1 For the last several years, the market value of the Companys retirement plan (pension) assets has exceeded the total actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits. Among the reasons 2006s income was lower than 2005s was a reduction of the assumed rate of return on plan assets from 9.25% to 9%. See also the discussion of pension accounting in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFC) AFC is a utility accounting practice whereby a portion of the cost of both equity and borrowed funds used to finance construction (which is shown on the balance sheet as construction work in progress) is capitalized. The Company includes an equity portion of AFC in nonoperating income and a debt portion of AFC in interest charges (credits) as noncash items, both of which have the effect of increasing reported net income. AFC represented approximately 2.0% of income before income taxes in 2006, 1.4% in 2005 and 6.8% in 2004. The lower level of AFC for 2005 is primarily due to reductions in the levels of capital expenditures subsequent to the completion of the Jasper County Electric Generation Station in May 2004 and completion of the Lake Murray back up dam project in May 2005. Electric Operations Electric Operations is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, GENCO and Fuel Company. Electric operations sales margins (including transactions with affiliates) were as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Operating revenues $ 1,877.6 (1.6 )% $ 1,908.3 13.1 % $ 1,687.7 Less: Fuel used in generation 615.1 (0.5 )% 618.3 32.4 % 466.9 Purchased power 27.5 (26.1 )% 37.2 (26.6 )% 50.7 Margin $ 1,235.0 (1.4 )% $ 1,252.8 7.1 % $ 1,170.1 2006 vs 2005 Margin decreased by $20.8 million due to unfavorable weather, by $16.0 million due to decreased off system sales and by $6.5 million due to lower industrial sales. These decreases were offset by residential and commercial customer growth of $26.5 million. Purchased power cost decreased due to lower volumes. 2005 vs 2004 Margin increased by $41.4 million due to increased retail electric rates that went into effect in January 2005, by $24.8 million due to residential and commercial customer growth and by $16.4 million due to increased off system sales. These increases were offset by a $2.4 million decrease due to unfavorable weather. Fuel used in generation increased $151.4 million due primarily to the increased cost of coal and natural gas used for electric generation. Purchased power cost decreased due to greater availability of generation facilities. Megawatt hour (MWh) sales volumes by class, related to the electric margin above, were as follows: Classification (in thousands) 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Residential 7,598 (0.5 )% 7,634 2.3 % 7,460 Commercial 7,249 1.9 % 7,117 3.1 % 6,900 Industrial 6,183 (6.0 )% 6,581 (2.9 )% 6,775 Sales for resale (excluding interchange) 1,487 1,487 (2.5 )% 1,525 Other 531 0.8 % 527 0.2 % 526 Total territorial 23,048 (1.3 )% 23,346 0.7 % 23,186 Negotiated Market Sales Tariff (NMST) 1,475 (24.9 )% 1,963 6.4 % 1,845 Total 24,523 (3.1 )% 25,309 1.1 % 25,031 2006 vs 2005 Territorial sales volumes decreased by 307 MWh due to lower industrial sales volumes and by 406 MWh due to unfavorable weather. These decreases were partially offset by 408 MWh due to residential and commercial customer growth. 2005 vs 2004 Territorial sales volumes increased by 407 MWh primarily due to customer growth partially offset by 261 MWh due to less favorable weather. Gas Distribution Gas Distribution is comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G and PSNC Energy. Gas distribution sales margins (including transactions with affiliates) were as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Operating revenues $ 1,078.0 (7.8 )% $ 1,168.6 27.9 % $ 913.9 Less: Gas purchased for resale 787.1 (12.0 )% 894.6 36.6 % 655.1 Margin $ 290.9 6.2 % $ 274.0 5.9 % $ 258.8 2006 vs 2005 Margin increased by $17.5 million due to increased retail gas base rates which became effective with the first billing cycle in November 2005 and by $4.0 million due to an SCPSC approved increase in retail gas base rates effective with the first billing cycle in November 2006. These increases were offset by $4.0 million due to lower firm margin resulting from customer conservation at SCE&G. The NCUC approved rate increase at PSNC Energy, effective with the first billing cycle in November 2006, increased margin by $2.4 million, but was offset primarily by customer conservation. 2005 vs 2004 Margin increased primarily due to customer growth of $6.9 million at PSNC Energy, higher firm margin of $4.7 million at SCE&G and $4.6 million due to increased retail gas base rates at SCE&G which became effective with the first billing cycle in November 2005. These increases were offset by a $0.8 million decrease due to lower interruptible margin and transportation revenue at SCE&G. Dekatherm (DT) sales volumes by class, including transportation gas, were as follows: Classification (in thousands) 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Residential 32,879 (13.2 )% 37,860 1.7 % 37,231 Commercial 25,718 (7.3 )% 27,750 1.8 % 27,271 Industrial 21,209 1.8 % 20,833 7.8 % 19,320 Transportation gas 30,147 8.8 % 27,698 (1.8 )% 28,216 Sales for resale (100.0 )% 1 Total 109,953 (3.7 )% 114,141 1.9 % 112,039 2006 vs 2005 Residential and commercial sales volumes decreased primarily due to milder weather and conservation. Transportation sales volumes increased primarily due to interruptible customers using gas instead of alternate fuels. 2005 vs 2004 Commercial and industrial sales volumes increased primarily due to more customers buying commodity gas instead of purchasing alternate fuels and instead of transporting gas purchased from others. Table of Contents Gas Transmission Gas Transmission is comprised of the operations of CGTC and, for periods prior to the name change and merger, SCPC and SCG Pipeline for all periods presented. Gas transmission transportation revenues and sales margins (including transactions with affiliates) were as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Transportation revenue $ 26.5 40.2 % $ 18.9 6.2 % $ 17.8 Other operating revenues 475.0 (26.5 )% 646.3 19.6 % 540.2 Less: Gas purchased for resale 439.2 (27.3 )% 604.2 21.6 % 496.9 Margin $ 62.3 2.1 % $ 61.0 (0.2 )% $ 61.1 2006 vs 2005 Margin increased by $6.2 million due to increased transportation capacity charges (as a result of the merger discussed previously in the Overview section) and by $1.4 million due to higher interruptible transportation revenues, offset by $1.8 million due to decreased firm sales capacity charges and by $4.5 million due to lower industrial margins. 2005 vs 2004 Operating revenues and gas purchased for resale increased primarily due to higher commodity gas prices. DT sales volumes by class, including transportation, were as follows: Classification (in thousands) 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Commercial 23 (57.4 )% 54 (52.2 )% 113 Industrial 18,875 (17.0 ) 22,748 (20.5 )% 28,625 Transportation 57,546 27.7 45,055 18.3 % 38,078 Sales for resale 33,327 (23.8 ) 43,763 1.9 % 42,946 Total 109,771 (1.7 ) 111,620 1.7 % 109,762 2006 vs 2005 Prior to the merger on November 1, 2006, industrial volumes decreased primarily due to higher commodity gas prices relative to alternate fuels. Subsequent to the merger, CGTC operates as a transportation only interstate pipeline. 2005 vs 2004 Industrial volumes decreased primarily due to higher commodity gas prices relative to alternate fuels. Retail Gas Marketing Retail Gas Marketing is comprised of SCANA Energy, which operates in Georgias natural gas market. Retail Gas Marketing revenues and net income were as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Operating revenues $ 608.1 (8.4 )% $ 664.0 20.3 % $ 552.0 Net income 30.1 24.9 % 24.1 (16.9 )% 29.0 2006 vs 2005 Operating revenues decreased primarily due to milder weather and customer conservation, resulting in lower customer usage, which was partially offset by higher average retail prices arising from higher commodity gas costs. Net income increased primarily due to decreased bad debt of $9.0 million and lower operating and customer service expenses of $6.2 million, partially offset by a margin decrease of $9.1 million, net of taxes. 2005 vs 2004 Operating revenues increased primarily as a result of higher average retail prices necessitated by higher commodity cost of gas. Net income decreased primarily due to increased bad debt of $5.9 million, and operating, marketing and customer service expenses of $4.4 million, offsetting a margin increase of $5.2 million, net of taxes. Delivered volumes totaled 33.6 million DT in 2006 and 37.9 million DT in each of 2005 and 2004. Volumes declined in 2006 compared to 2005 and 2004 due to milder weather and customer conservation. Table of Contents Energy Marketing Energy Marketing is comprised of the Companys non regulated marketing operations, excluding SCANA Energy. Energy Marketing operating revenues and net loss were as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Operating revenues $ 948.7 0.3 % $ 945.5 58.5 % $ 596.5 Net loss (0.4 ) (33.3) % (0.6 ) (70.0) % (2.0 ) 2006 vs 2005 Operating revenues increased due primarily to higher sales volume. Net loss decreased due to lower operating expenses of $1.0 million which was offset by lower margin on sales of $0.9 million. 2005 vs 2004 Operating revenues increased due to higher market prices and higher sales volume. Net loss decreased primarily due to higher margins of $0.6 million and lower operating expenses of $0.8 million. Delivered volumes totaled 123.9 million DT in 2006, 101.0 million DT in 2005 and 91.8 million DT in 2004. Delivered volumes increased in 2006 compared to 2005 primarily as a result of increased service to electric generation facilities and municipalities in Georgia and South Carolina. Delivered volumes increased in 2005 compared to 2004 primarily as a result of the commencement of service to SCE&Gs Jasper County Electric Generating Station in 2004. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses, which arose from the operating segments previously discussed, were as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Other operation and maintenance $ 619.2 (2.0 )% $ 632.0 4.0 % $ 607.5 Depreciation and amortization 332.4 (34.8 )% 509.9 92.3 % 265.1 Other taxes 151.8 4.7 % 145.0 (0.4 )% 145.6 Total $ 1,103.4 (14.3 )% $ 1,286.9 26.4 % $ 1,018.2 2006 vs 2005 Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased by $13.9 million due to lower bad debts and by $9.5 million due to lower operating and customer service expenses, both at retail gas marketing, and by $22.5 million due to decreased incentive compensation expense. These decreases were partially offset by $11.1 million due to increased electric, generation, transmission and distribution expenses, by $3.1 million due to increased gas distribution expenses, by $3.6 million due to lower pension income and by $2.0 million due to higher customer service expenses at SCE&G. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $185.8 million due to lower accelerated depreciation of the back up dam at Lake Murray in 2006 (see Income Taxes Recognition of Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits), partially offset by $6.7 million due to property additions and higher depreciation rates at SCE&G. Other taxes increased primarily due to higher property taxes. 2005 vs 2004 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to increased electric generation major maintenance expenses of $6.7 million, increased expenses associated with the Jasper County Electric Generating Station completed in May 2004 totaling $2.4 million, increased nuclear operating and maintenance expenses of $2.4 million, higher expenses related to regulatory matters of $1.9 million and higher amortization of regulatory assets of $3.6 million. The increases were offset primarily by decreased long term bonus and incentive plan expenses of $4.8 million and decreased storm damage expenses of $0.9 million (at SCE&G). Depreciation and amortization increased approximately $214.0 million due to accelerated depreciation of the back up dam at Lake Murray (see Income Taxes Recognition of Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits), increased $6.5 million due to the completion of the Jasper County Electric Generating Station in May 2004 and increased $6.1 million due to normal net property changes at SCE&G. In addition, as a result of the January 2005 rate order, SCE&G received approval to amortize previously deferred purchased power costs and to implement new depreciation rates, resulting in $17.3 million of additional depreciation and amortization expense in the period. Table of Contents Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) includes the results of certain incidental (non utility) activities and the activities of certain non regulated subsidiaries. Components of other income (expense), were as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Gain (loss) on sale of investments $ (100.0 )% $ 7.2 * $ (21.2 ) Gains on sales of assets 3.4 100.0 % 1.7 * 0.7 Impairment of investments (100.0 )% (26.9 ) Other revenues 141.6 (42.9 )% 248.1 36.9 % 181.2 Other expenses (93.1 ) (53.5) % (200.3 ) 25.3 % (159.9 ) Total $ 51.9 (8.5 )% $ 56.7 * $ (26.1 ) * Greater than 100% 2006 vs 2005 Other revenues decreased $91.5 million due to lower power marketing activities, $10.8 million due to the termination of a contract to operate a steam combustion turbine at the United States Department of Energy (DOE) Savannah River Site and by $4.3 million due to lower carrying costs recognized on the unrecovered balance of the Lake Murray back up dam project and lower management service fees of $10.0 million received by Primesouth, Inc., as discussed at Income Taxes Recognition of Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits below. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest income of $9.4 million and higher third party coal sales revenue of $4.8 million. Other expenses decreased by $90.6 million due to lower power marketing activities and $4.4 million due to the termination of the DOEs Savannah River Site contract. These decreases were partially offset by increased charges of $8.7 million related to the settlement of the FERC power marketing matter (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements) and higher expenses to support third party coal sales of $3.6 million. 2005 vs 2004 Gain (loss) on sale of investments increased due to the receipt in 2005 of additional proceeds of $6.0 million from the 2003 sale of the Companys investment in ITC Holding. These proceeds had been held in escrow pending resolution of certain contingencies. In 2004 the Company recognized a $21.0 million loss on the sale of investments in Knology and ITC^DeltaCom. In 2004 impairments of $26.9 million were recorded on investments in Knology, ITC Holding and Magnolia Holding. Other revenues increased $42.8 million due to higher power marketing activity and $10.9 million due to carrying costs recognized on the unrecovered balance of the Lake Murray back up dam project. Other expenses increased $43.1 million due to higher power marketing activity and $.8 million due to the charge associated with the FERC power marketing matter. (See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.) Interest Expense Components of interest expense, net of the debt component of AFC, were as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Interest on long term debt, net $ 190.9 (4.3 )% $ 199.5 0.7 % $ 198.1 Other interest expense 18.7 48.4 % 12.6 * 4.3 Total $ 209.6 (1.2 )% $ 212.1 4.8 % $ 202.4 * Greater than 100% 2006 vs 2005 Interest on long term debt decreased primarily due to reduced long term borrowings, partially offset by increased variable rates. Other interest expense increased primarily due to increased short term borrowings. Table of Contents 2005 vs 2004 Interest on long term debt increased primarily due to the lower level of AFC resulting from reductions in the levels of capital expenditures subsequent to the completion of the Jasper County Electric Generation Station in May 2004 and the Lake Murray back up dam project in May 2005, partially offset by the redemption of outstanding debt in late 2004. Other interest expense increased primarily due to increased short term borrowings at SCE&G. Income Taxes Income taxes, exclusive of amounts related to the cumulative effect of an accounting change, increased in 2006 compared to 2005 by $237.6 million and decreased in 2005 compared to 2004 by $240.8 million. Changes in income taxes are primarily due to changes in operating income and other income, although in 2005 the benefits of synthetic fuel credits of $179.0 million were also recognized pursuant to the January 2005 electric rate order. The Companys effective tax rate has been favorably impacted in recent years by the flow through of state investment tax credits and the equity portion of AFC. Recognition of Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits SCE&G holds equity method investments in two partnerships involved in converting coal to synthetic fuel, the use of which fuel qualifies for federal income tax credits. Under an accounting plan approved by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (SCPSC) in June 2000, the synthetic fuel tax credits generated by the partnerships and passed through to SCE&G, net of partnership losses and other expenses, were deferred until the SCPSC approved its application to offset capital costs of the Lake Murray back up dam project. Under the accounting methodology approved by the SCPSC in a January 2005 order, construction costs related to the project were recorded in utility plant in service in a special dam remediation account outside of rate base, and depreciation is being recognized against the balance in this account on an accelerated basis, subject to the availability of the synthetic fuel tax credits. The level of depreciation expense and related tax benefit recognized in the income statement is equal to the available synthetic fuel tax credits, less partnership losses and other expenses, net of taxes. As a result, the balance of unrecovered costs in the dam remediation account declines as accelerated depreciation is recorded. Although these entries collectively have no impact on consolidated net income, they have a significant impact on individual line items within the income statement. The accelerated depreciation, synthetic fuel tax credits, partnership losses and the income tax benefit arising from such losses recognized by SCE&G during 2006 and 2005 are as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 2005 Depreciation and amortization expense $ (28.2 ) $ (214.0 ) Income tax benefits: From synthetic fuel tax credits 30.0 179.0 From accelerated depreciation 10.8 81.8 From partnership losses 7.8 28.9 Total income tax benefits 48.6 289.7 Losses from Equity Method Investments (20.4 ) (75.7 ) Impact on Net Income The 2005 amounts above reflect the recognition of previously deferred tax credits, while the 2006 amounts reflect the likelihood that credits available in 2006 will be phased down pursuant to regulations which limit the credits based on the relative commodity price of crude oil. Depreciation on the Lake Murray back up dam project account will be matched to available synthetic fuel tax credits on a quarterly basis until the balance in the dam remediation account is zero or until all of the available synthetic fuel tax credits have been utilized. The synthetic fuel tax credit program expires at the end of 2007. The availability of the synthetic fuel tax credits is dependent on several factors, one of which is the average annual domestic wellhead price per barrel of crude oil as published by the U.S. Government. Under a phase out provision included in the program, if the domestic wellhead reference price of oil per barrel for a given year is below an inflation adjusted benchmark range for that year, all of the synthetic fuel tax credits that have been generated in that year would be available for use. If that price is above the benchmark range, none of the tax credits would be available. If that price falls within the benchmark range, a calculated portion of the credits would be available. The benchmark price range for 2005, published in April 2006, was $53 to $67 per barrel, and no phase out applied. However, SCE&Gs analysis indicates that the available synthetic fuel tax credits for 2006 are likely to be impacted by the phase out calculation. As such, in 2006 the Company recorded synthetic fuel tax credits and applied those credits to allow the recording of accelerated depreciation related to the balance in the dam remediation project account based on an estimate that only 67% of credits generated will be available (phase out of 33%). The Company cannot predict what impact, if any, the price of oil may have on the Companys ability to earn and utilize synthetic fuel tax credits in the future. However, there is significant uncertainty as to the continued availability of the credits in 2007. The availability of these synthetic fuel tax credits is also subject to coal availability and other operational risks related to the generating plants. The Company does not expect available credits to be sufficient to fully recover the construction costs of dam remediation, and total unrecovered cost at the end of December 31, 2007 may be significant. To the extent that available credits are not sufficient to fully recover the construction costs of the dam remediation, regulatory action to allow recovery of those remaining costs may be sought. As of December 31, 2006, remaining unrecovered costs, based on managements recording of accelerated depreciation and related tax benefits, were $69.1 million. Finally, Primesouth, Inc., a subsidiary of SCANA, provides management and maintenance services for a non affiliated synthetic fuel production facility. Reduced synthetic fuel tax credit availability under the above phase out provisions also adversely impacts the level of payment Primesouth receives for these services. The fees recognized by Primesouth in 2006 were $10.0 million lower than amounts recognized in 2005. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Cash requirements for SCANAs regulated subsidiaries arise primarily from their operational needs, funding their construction programs and payment of dividends to SCANA. The ability of the regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant investment, to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas and to install equipment necessary to comply with environmental regulations, will depend on their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms. Regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers. Rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs. As customer growth and inflation occur and these subsidiaries continue their ongoing construction programs, rate increases will be sought. The future financial position and results of operations of the regulated subsidiaries will be affected by their ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief, if requested. SCE&G expects to require the addition of base load electrical generation by 2015 and is evaluating alternatives, including fossil and nuclear fueled generation facilities. In February 2006, SCE&G and the South Carolina Public Service Authority (Santee Cooper), a state owned utility in South Carolina (joint owners of V. C. Summer Nuclear Station (Summer Station)), announced their selection of the Summer Station site as the preferred site for new nuclear generation facilities should such generation be considered the best alternative in the future. Due to the significant lead time required for construction of nuclear generation facilities, the joint owners are preparing an application to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a combined construction and operating license (COL) that would cover two nuclear units. The COL application, which is expected to be completed and filed in 2007, would be reviewed by the NRC for an estimated three years. Issuance of a COL would not obligate the joint owners to build nuclear generation facilities. The final decision to build nuclear generation facilities will be influenced by several factors, including NRC licensing attainment, estimates of construction and operating costs, the cost of competing fuels, regulatory and environmental requirements and financial market conditions. The Companys leverage ratio of debt to capital was 55% at December 31, 2006. If the agencies rating the Companys credit determine that the Companys leverage ratio, among other measures, is too high, these rating agencies may downgrade the Companys debt. Such a downgrade would adversely affect the interest rate the Company is able to obtain when issuing debt, both short term and long term, and would limit the Companys access to capital markets. Table of Contents The Companys current estimates of its capital expenditures for construction and nuclear fuel for 2007 2009, which are subject to continuing review and adjustment, are as follows: Estimated Capital Expenditures Millions of dollars 2007 2008 2009 SCE&G: Electric Plant: Generation (including GENCO) $ 220 $ 361 $ 255 Transmission 45 52 35 Distribution 151 155 153 Other 28 38 17 Nuclear Fuel 55 6 26 Gas 50 59 52 Common and other 28 10 12 Total SCE&G 577 681 550 Other Companies Combined 151 160 142 Total $ 728 $ 841 $ 692 The Companys contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2006 are summarized as follows: Contractual Cash Obligations Millions of dollars Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Long term and short term debt (including interest and preferred stock) $ 6,310 $ 841 $ 900 $ 1,151 $ 3,418 Capital leases 2 1 1 Operating leases 57 30 25 2 Purchase obligations 647 348 296 2 1 Other commercial commitments 7,513 1,275 2,283 977 2,978 Total $ 14,529 $ 2,495 $ 3,505 $ 2,130 $ 6,399 Included in other commercial commitments are estimated obligations under forward contracts for natural gas purchases. Forward contracts for natural gas purchases include customary make whole or default provisions, but are not considered to be take or pay contracts. Certain of these contracts relate to regulated businesses; therefore, the effects of such contracts on fuel costs are reflected in electric or gas rates. Also included in other commercial commitments is a take and pay contract for natural gas which expires in 2019 and estimated obligations for coal and nuclear fuel purchases. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Included in purchase obligations are customary purchase orders under which the Company has the option to utilize certain vendors without the obligation to do so. The Company may terminate such obligations without penalty. In addition to the contractual cash obligations above, the Company sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan and an unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plan for retirees. The pension plan is adequately funded, and no further contributions are anticipated until after 2010. Cash payments under the health care and life insurance benefit plan were $9.7 million in 2006, and such annual payments are expected to increase to the $13 $14 million range in the future. In addition, the Company is party to certain New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) futures contracts for which any unfavorable market movements are funded in cash. These derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges under SFAS 133, Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities, as amended, and their effects are reflected within other comprehensive income until the anticipated sales transactions occur. See further discussion at Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. The Company also has a legal obligation associated with the decommissioning and dismantling of Summer Station and other conditional asset retirement obligations that are not listed in the contractual cash obligations table. See Notes 1B and 10H to the consolidated financial statements. The Company anticipates that its contractual cash obligations will be met through internally generated funds and the incurrence of additional short term and long term indebtedness. The Company expects that it has or can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet its projected cash requirements for the foreseeable future. Cash outlays for 2006 (actual) and 2007 (estimated) for certain expenditures are as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 2007 Property additions and construction expenditures, net of AFC $ 527 $ 673 Nuclear fuel expenditures 17 55 Investments 25 19 Total $ 569 $ 747 Financing Limits and Related Matters The Companys issuance of various securities, including long term and short term debt, is subject to customary approval or authorization by regulatory bodies including state public service commissions and FERC. Descriptions of financing programs currently utilized by the Company follow. Pursuant to Section 204 of the Federal Power Act, SCE&G and GENCO must obtain FERC authority to issue short term debt. Effective February 8, 2006 the FERC has authorized SCE&G and GENCO to issue up to $700 million and $100 million, respectively, of unsecured promissory notes or commercial paper with maturity dates of one year or less. This authorization expires February 7, 2008. At December 31, 2006, SCANA, SCE&G (including Fuel Company) and PSNC Energy had available the following lines of credit and short term borrowings outstanding: Millions of dollars SCANA SCE&G PSNC Energy Lines of credit (total and unused): Committed long term (expires December 2011) $ 200 $ 650 $ 250 Uncommitted 103 (a) Short term borrowings outstanding: Bank loans/commercial paper (270 or fewer days) $ $ 362.2 $ 124.7 Weighted average interest rate 5.38 % 5.40 % (a) SCANA or SCE&G may use $78 million of these lines of credit. SCANA Corporation SCANA has in effect a medium term note program for the issuance from time to time of unsecured medium term debt securities. The Indenture under which they are issued contains no specific limit on the amount which may be issued. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company In September 2006 SCE&G discharged its bond indenture dated January 1, 1945 which covered substantially all of its properties. SCE&G remains subject to a bond indenture dated April 1, 1993 (Mortgage) covering substantially all of its electric properties under which all of its currently outstanding First Mortgage Bonds and all of its future mortgage backed debt (Bonds) has been and will be issued. Bonds may be issued under the Mortgage in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the sum of (1) 70% of Unfunded Net Property Additions (as therein defined), (2) the aggregate principal amount of retired Bonds and (3) cash deposited with the trustee. Bonds will be issuable under the Mortgage only if Adjusted Net Earnings (as therein defined) for 12 consecutive months out of the 18 months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least twice the annual interest requirements on all outstanding Bonds and Bonds to be outstanding (Bond Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Bond Ratio was 6.99. SCE&Gs Restated Articles of Incorporation (Articles) prohibit issuance of additional shares of preferred stock without the consent of the preferred shareholders unless net earnings (as therein defined) for the 12 consecutive months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least one and one half times the aggregate of all interest charges and preferred stock dividend requirements on all shares of preferred stock outstanding immediately after the proposed issue (Preferred Stock Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Preferred Stock Ratio was 1.99. The Articles also require the consent of a majority of the total voting power of SCE&Gs preferred stock before SCE&G may issue or assume any unsecured indebtedness if, after such issue or assumption, the total principal amount of all such unsecured indebtedness would exceed ten percent of the aggregate principal amount of all of SCE&Gs secured indebtedness and capital and surplus (the ten percent test). No such consent is required to enter into agreements for payment of principal, interest and premium for securities issued for pollution control purposes. At December 31, 2006, the ten percent test would have limited total issuances of unsecured indebtedness to approximately $428.4 million. Unsecured indebtedness at December 31, 2006, totaled approximately $357.8 million, and was comprised primarily of short term borrowings. Financing Cash Flows During 2006 the Company experienced net cash outflows related to financing activities of $83 million primarily due to the payment of dividends, which were partially offset by net increases in long term and short term borrowings and proceeds from common stock issuances. The Company uses interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risk. These swap agreements provide for the Company to pay variable and receive fixed rate interest payments and are designated as fair value hedges of certain debt instruments. The Company may terminate a swap agreement and may replace it with a new swap also designated as a fair value hedge. Payments received upon termination of such swaps are recorded as basis adjustments to long term debt and are amortized as reductions to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. At December 31, 2006, the estimated fair value of the Companys swaps totaled a $0.1 million gain related to combined notional amounts of $44.2 million. In anticipation of the issuance of debt, the Company may use interest rate lock or similar agreements to manage interest rate risk. Payments received or made upon termination of such agreements are recorded within long term debt on the balance sheet and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. In connection with the issuance of first mortgage bonds in June 2006, SCE&G received approximately $8.8 million upon the termination of an interest rate lock. These proceeds are being amortized over the life of the related debt, thereby reducing its effective interest rate. As permitted by SFAS 104 Statement of Cash Flows Net Reporting of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments and Classification of Cash Flows from Hedging Transactions, these proceeds have been classified as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. For additional information on significant financing activities, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. On February 15, 2007, SCANA increased the quarterly cash dividend rate on SCANA common stock to $.44 per share, an increase of 4.8%. The new dividend is payable April 1, 2007 to stockholders of record on March 9, 2007. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Capital Expenditures For the three years ended December 31, 2006, the Companys capital expenditures for environmental control totaled $160.2 million. These expenditures were in addition to expenditures included in Other operation and maintenance expenses, which were $28.7 million, $25.2 million, and $21.5 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. It is not possible to estimate all future costs related to environmental matters, but forecasts for capitalized environmental expenditures for the Company are $154.7 million for 2007 and $494.8 million for the four year period 2008 through 2011. These expenditures are included in the Companys Estimated Capital Expenditures table, discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources, and include the matters discussed below. Electric Operations In March 2005, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule known as the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). CAIR requires the District of Columbia and 28 states, including South Carolina, to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in order to attain mandated state levels. SCE&G has petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review CAIR. Several other electric utilities have filed separate petitions. The petitioners seek a change in the method CAIR uses to allocate sulfur dioxide emission allowances to a method the petitioners believe is more equitable. The Company believes that installation of additional air quality controls will be needed to meet the CAIR requirements. The Company is reviewing the final rule. Compliance plans and cost to comply with the rule will be determined once the Company completes its review. Such costs will be material and are expected to be recoverable through rates. Table of Contents In March 2005, the EPA issued a final rule establishing a mercury emissions cap and trade program for coal fired power plants that requires limits to be met in two phases, in 2010 and 2018. Although the Company expects to be able to meet the Phase I limits through those measures it already will be taking to meet its CAIR obligations, it is uncertain as to how the Phase II limits will be met. Assuming Phase II limits remain unchanged, installation of additional air quality controls likely will be required to comply with the rules Phase II mercury emission caps. Final compliance plans and costs to comply with the rule are still under review. Such costs will be material and are expected to be recoverable through rates. The EPA has undertaken an aggressive enforcement initiative against the utilities industry, and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has brought suit against a number of utilities in federal court alleging violations of the Clean Air Act (CAA). At least two of these suits have either been tried or have had substantive motions decidedone favorable to the industry and one not. The one not favorable to the industry is not binding as precedent and the one favorable to the industry likely is precedent and is consistent with current Company interpretation of the law and its resulting maintenance practices. Prior to the suits, those utilities had received requests for information under Section 114 of the CAA and were issued Notices of Violation. The basis for these suits is the assertion by the EPA, under a stringent rule known as New Source Review (NSR), that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities over the past 20 or more years constitute major modifications which would have required the installation of costly Best Available Control Technology (BACT). SCE&G and GENCO have received and responded to Section 114 requests for information related to Canadys, Wateree and Williams Stations. The regulations under the CAA provide certain exemptions to the definition of major modifications, including an exemption for routine repair, replacement or maintenance. On October 27, 2003, EPA published a final revised NSR rule in the Federal Register with an effective date of December 26, 2003. The rule represents an industry favorable departure from certain positions advanced by the federal government in the NSR enforcement initiative. However, on motion of several Northeastern states, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stayed the effect of the final rule. The ultimate application of the final rule to the Company is uncertain. The Company has analyzed each of the activities covered by the EPAs requests and believes each of these activities is covered by the exemption for routine repair, replacement and maintenance under what it believes is a fair reading of both the prior regulation and the contested revised regulation. The regulations also provide an exemption for an increase in emissions resulting from increased hours of operation or production rate and from demand growth. The current state of continued DOJ enforcement actions is the subject of industry wide speculation, but it is possible that the EPA will commence enforcement actions against SCE&G and GENCO, and the EPA has the authority to seek penalties at the rate of up to $27,500 per day for each violation. The EPA also could seek installation of BACT (or equivalent) at the three plants. The Company believes that any enforcement actions relative to the Companys compliance with the CAA would be without merit. The Company has completed installation of selective catalytic reactors at Wateree and Williams for nitrogen oxides control and is proceeding with plans to install sulfur dioxide scrubbers at both of these stations to meet CAIR regulations. These actions would mitigate many of the concerns with NSR. SCE&G and GENCO expect to incur capital expenditures totaling approximately $450 million over the 2007 2010 period to install this new equipment. SCE&G and GENCO expect to have increased operation and maintenance costs of approximately $4 million in 2010 and $27 million in 2011 and each subsequent year thereafter. To meet compliance requirements for the years 2012 through 2016, the Company anticipates additional capital expenditures totaling approximately $480 million. The Clean Water Act, as amended, provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require treatment for wastewater discharges. Under the Clean Water Act, compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program. Discharge permits have been issued for all, and renewed for nearly all, of SCE&Gs and GENCOs generating units. Concurrent with renewal of these permits, the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program of monitoring and controlling discharges, has modified the requirements for cooling water intake structures, and has required strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams. The Company is conducting studies and is developing or implementing compliance plans for these initiatives. Congress is expected to consider further amendments to the Clean Water Act. Such legislation may include limitations to mixing zones and toxicity based standards. These provisions, if passed, could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company, SCE&G and GENCO. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (Nuclear Waste Act) required that the United States government, by January 31, 1998, accept and permanently dispose of high level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. The Nuclear Waste Act also imposed on utilities the primary responsibility for storage of their spent nuclear fuel until the repository is available. SCE&G entered into a Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and or High Level Radioactive Waste (Standard Contract) with the DOE in 1983 providing for permanent disposal of its spent nuclear fuel in exchange for agreed payments fixed in the Standard Contract at particular amounts. On January 28, 2004, SCE&G and Santee Cooper (one third owner of Summer Station) filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims against the DOE for breach of the Standard Contract, because as of the date of filing, the federal government had accepted no spent fuel from Summer Station or any other utility for transport and disposal, and has indicated that it does not anticipate doing so until 2010, at the earliest. As a consequence of the federal governments breach of contract, the plaintiffs have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs. On January 9, 2006, SCE&G and Santee Cooper accepted a $9 million settlement from DOE. The payment reimbursed the plaintiffs for certain costs incurred from January 31, 1998 through July 31, 2005. SCE&G recorded its portion ($6 million) of the settlement as a reduction to its fuel costs. As a result, most of the credit was passed through to its customers through the fuel clause component of its retail electric rates. The settlement also provides for the plaintiffs to submit an annual application to DOE for the reimbursement of certain costs incurred subsequent to July 31, 2005. SCE&G has on site spent nuclear fuel storage capability until at least 2018 and expects to be able to expand its storage capacity to accommodate the spent nuclear fuel output for the life of the plant through dry cask storage or other technology as it becomes available. SCE&G has been named, along with 53 others, by the EPA as a PRP at the Alternate Energy Resources, Inc. (AER) Superfund site located in Augusta, Georgia. The EPA placed the site on the National Priorities List on April 19, 2006. AER conducted hazardous waste storage and treatment operations from 1975 to 2000, when the site was abandoned. While operational, AER processed fuels from waste oils, treated industrial coolants and oil/water emulsions, recycled solvents and blended hazardous waste fuels. During that time, SCE&G occasionally used AER for the processing of waste solvents, oily rags and oily wastewater. EPA and the State of Georgia have documented that a release or releases have occurred at the site leading to contamination of groundwater, surface water and soils. EPA and the State of Georgia have conducted a preliminary assessment and site inspection. The site has not been cleaned up nor has a cleanup cost been estimated. Although a basis for the allocation of clean up costs among the PRPs is unclear, SCE&G does not believe that its involvement at this site would result in an allocation of costs that would have a material adverse impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Any cost allocated to SCE&G arising from the remediation of this site, net of insurance recoveries, if any, is expected to be recoverable through rates. SCE&G has been named, along with 29 others, by the EPA as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at the Carolina Transformer Superfund site located in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The Carolina Transformer Company (CTC) conducted an electrical transformer rebuilding and repair operation at the site from 1967 to 1984. During that time, SCE&G occasionally used CTC for the repair of existing transformers, purchase of new transformers and sale of used transformers. In 1984, EPA initiated a cleanup of PCB contaminated soil and groundwater at the site. EPA reports that it has spent $36 million to date. Although a basis for the allocation of clean up costs among the PRPs is unclear, SCE&G does not believe that its involvement at this site would result in an allocation of costs that would have a material adverse impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Any cost allocated to SCE&G arising from the remediation of this site, net of insurance recoveries, if any, is expected to be recoverable through rates. Gas Distribution The Company maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could require environmental cleanup. As site assessments are initiated, estimates are made of the amount of expenditures, if any, deemed necessary to investigate and clean up each site. These estimates are refined as additional information becomes available; therefore, actual expenditures may differ significantly from the original estimates. Amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and cleanup relate solely to regulated operations. Such amounts are recorded in deferred debits and amortized with recovery provided through rates. Deferred amounts for SCE&G, net of amounts previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements, totaled $17.9 million at December 31, 2006 and $17.7 million at December 31, 2005. The deferral includes the estimated costs associated with the following matters. SCE&G owns a decommissioned MGP site in the Calhoun Park area of Charleston, South Carolina. SCE&G anticipates that remediation for contamination at the site will be completed in late 2007, with certain monitoring and retreatment activities continuing until 2011. As of December 31, 2006, SCE&G has spent $22.3 million to remediate the Calhoun Park site, and expects to spend an additional $1.1 million. In addition, the National Park Service of the Department of the Interior made an initial demand to SCE&G for payment of $9.1 million for certain costs and damages relating to this site. SCE&G expects to recover any cost arising from the remediation of this site through rates. SCE&G owns three other decommissioned MGP sites in South Carolina which contain residues of by product chemicals. One of the sites has been remediated and will undergo routine monitoring until released by DHEC. The other sites are currently being investigated under work plans approved by DHEC. SCE&G anticipates that major remediation activities for the three sites will be completed in 2011. As of December 31, 2006, SCE&G has spent $4.8 million related to these three sites, and expects to spend an additional $11.2 million. SCE&G expects to recover any cost arising from the remediation of these sites through rates. Table of Contents PSNC Energy is responsible for environmental cleanup at five sites in North Carolina on which MGP residuals are present or suspected. PSNC Energys remediation costs for these sites will depend on a number of factors, such as actual site conditions, third party claims and recoveries from other PRPs. PSNC Energy has recorded a liability and associated regulatory asset of $6.9 million, which reflects its estimated remaining liability at December 31, 2006. Amounts incurred and deferred to date, net of insurance settlements, that are not currently being recovered through gas rates are $0.9 million. PSNC Energy expects to recover any costs allocated to PSNC Energy arising from the remediation of these sites through gas rates. REGULATORY MATTERS Material retail rate proceedings are described in more detail in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company SCE&G is subject to the jurisdiction of the SCPSC as to retail electric and gas rates, service, accounting, issuance of securities (other than short term borrowings) and other matters. The Natural Gas Stabilization Act of 2005 allows natural gas distribution companies to request annual adjustments to rates to reflect changes in revenues and expenses and changes in investment. Such annual adjustments are subject to certain qualifying criteria and review by the SCPSC. Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated PSNC Energy is subject to the jurisdiction of the NCUC as to gas rates, issuance of securities (other than notes with a maturity of two years or less or renewals of notes with a maturity of six years or less), accounting and other matters. The United States Congress passed the Pipeline Safety Improvement Act of 2002 (the Pipeline Safety Act), directing the United States Department of Transportation (DOT) to establish the Integrity Management Rule for operations of natural gas systems with transmission pipelines located near moderate to high density populations. Of PSNC Energys approximately 720 miles of transmission pipeline subject to the Pipeline Safety Act, approximately 110 miles are located within these areas. Fifty percent of these miles of pipeline must be assessed by December 2007, and the remainder by December 2012. Depending on the assessment method used, PSNC Energy will be required to reinspect these same miles of pipeline every five to seven years. Though cost estimates for this project were developed using various assumptions, each of which is subject to imprecision, PSNC Energy currently estimates the total cost through December 2012 to be $8 million for the initial assessments, not including any subsequent remediation that may be required. Effective November 1, 2004 the NCUC authorized deferral accounting for certain expenses incurred to comply with DOTs pipeline integrity management requirements. In accordance with an October 2006 NCUC rate order, $1.4 million in costs incurred and deferred through June 30, 2006 are now being recovered through rates over a three year period. Additionally, management believes that all subsequent costs will be recoverable by PSNC Energy through rates. Carolina Gas Transmission Corporation CGTC has approximately 65 miles of transmission line that are covered by the Integrity Management Rule of the Pipeline Safety Act. Though cost estimates for this project were developed using various assumptions, each of which is subject to imprecision, CGTC currently estimates the total cost to be $10.9 million for the initial assessments and any subsequent remediation required through December 2012. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Following are descriptions of the Companys accounting policies and estimates which are most critical in terms of reporting financial condition or results of operations. Utility Regulation SCANAs regulated utilities are subject to the provisions of SFAS 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, which require them to record certain assets and liabilities that defer the recognition of expenses and revenues to future periods as a result of being rate regulated. In the future, as a result of deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment, the Company may no longer meet the criteria for continued application of SFAS 71 and could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, liquidity or financial position of the Companys Electric Distribution and Gas Distribution segments in the period the write off would be recorded. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the Companys regulatory assets and liabilities, including those associated with the Companys environmental assessment program. The Companys generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market. If market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs, the Company could be required to write down its investment in those assets. The Company cannot predict whether any write downs will be necessary and, if they are, the extent to which they would adversely affect the Companys results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded. As of December 31, 2006, the Companys net investments in fossil/hydro and nuclear generation assets were approximately $2.3 billion and $506 million, respectively. Revenue Recognition and Unbilled Revenues Revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers of the Companys utilities and retail gas operations are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual reading of their electric and gas meters, the Company records estimates for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. Such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters. Such unbilled revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class, the effects of different rate schedules, changes in weather and, where applicable, the impact of weather normalization provisions of rate structures. The accrual of unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs. Accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of $177.6 million at December 31, 2006 and $280.9 million at December 31, 2005, compared to total revenues of $4.6 billion for 2006 and $4.8 billion for 2005. Provisions for Bad Debts and Allowances for Doubtful Accounts As of each balance sheet date, the Company evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable and records allowances for doubtful accounts based on estimates of the level of expected write offs. These estimates are based on, among other things, comparisons of the relative age of accounts, assigned credit ratings for commercial and industrial accounts, credit scores for residential customers in Georgia when available, and consideration of actual write off history. The distribution segments of the Companys regulated utilities have established write off histories and regulated service areas that tend to improve the recoverability of accounts and enable the utilities to reliably estimate their respective provisions for bad debts. The Companys Retail Gas Marketing segment operates in Georgias deregulated natural gas market in which customers may obtain service from others without necessarily paying outstanding amounts and in which there are certain limitations on the Companys ability to effect timely shut off of service for nonpayment. As such estimation of the provision for bad debts for these accounts is subject to greater imprecision. Nuclear Decommissioning Accounting for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future. Among the factors that could change SCE&Gs accounting estimates related to decommissioning costs are changes in technology, changes in regulatory and environmental remediation requirements, and changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and timing of cash flows. Changes in any of these estimates could significantly impact the Companys financial position and cash flows (although changes in such estimates should be earnings neutral, because these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers). SCE&Gs two thirds share of estimated site specific nuclear decommissioning costs for Summer Station, including both the cost of decommissioning plant components that are and are not subject to radioactive contamination, totals $451.0 million, stated in 2006 dollars, based on a decommissioning study completed in 2006. Santee Cooper is responsible for decommissioning costs related to its one third ownership interest in Summer Station. The cost estimate assumes that the site would be maintained over a period of 60 years in such a manner as to allow for subsequent decontamination that would permit release for unrestricted use. Under SCE&Gs method of funding decommissioning costs, amounts collected through rates are invested in insurance policies on the lives of certain Company personnel. SCE&G transfers to an external trust fund the amounts collected through electric rates, insurance proceeds, and interest on proceeds, less expenses. The trusteed asset balance reflects the net cash surrender value of the insurance policies held by the trust. Management intends for the fund, including earnings thereon, to provide for all eventual decommissioning expenditures on an after tax basis. Table of Contents Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Company follows SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, as amended by SFAS 158, Employees Accounting for Defined Benefit Pension and Other Postretirement Plans, in accounting for the cost of its defined benefit pension plan. The Companys plan is adequately funded and as such, net pension income is reflected in the financial statements (see Results of Operations Pension Income). SFAS 87 requires the use of several assumptions, the selection of which may have a large impact on the resulting benefit recorded. Among the more sensitive assumptions are those surrounding discount rates and expected returns on assets. Net pension income of $13.5 million recorded in 2006 reflects the use of a 5.60% discount rate and an assumed 9.00% long term rate of return on plan assets. The Company believes that these assumptions were, and that the resulting pension income amount was, reasonable. For purposes of comparison, using a discount rate of 5.35% in 2006 would have decreased the Companys pension income by $1.1 million. Had the assumed long term rate of return on assets been 8.75%, the Companys pension income for 2006 would have been reduced by $2.1 million. For 2006, the Company selected the discount rate of 5.60% which was derived using a cash flow matching technique. For 2007, the discount rate to be used will be 5.85%, which was derived using that same cash flow matching technique. The same discount rates were also selected for determination of other postemployment benefits costs discussed below. The following information with respect to pension assets (and returns thereon) should also be noted. The Company determines the fair value of substantially all of its pension assets utilizing market quotes rather than utilizing any calculated values, market related values or other modeling techniques. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumptions, the Company evaluates input from actuaries and from pension fund investment consultants. Such consultants 2006 review of the plans historical 10, 15, 20 and 25 year cumulative performance showed actual returns of 9.3%, 11.0%, 11.2% and 12.7%, respectively, all of which have been in excess of related broad indices. The 2006 expected long term rate of return of 9.0% was based on a target asset allocation of 70% with equity managers and 30% with fixed income managers. Management regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate. For 2007, the expected rate of return will be 9.0%. The pension trust is adequately funded, and no contributions have been required since 1997. Management does not anticipate the need to make pension contributions until after 2010. Similar to its pension accounting, the Company follows SFAS 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, as amended by SFAS 158 in accounting for the cost of its postretirement medical and life insurance benefits. This plan is unfunded, so no assumptions related to rate of return on assets impact the net expense recorded; however, the selection of discount rates can significantly impact the actuarial determination of net expense. The Company used a discount rate of 5.60% and recorded a net SFAS 106 cost of $22.3 million for 2006. Had the selected discount rate been 5.35%, the expense for 2006 would have been $0.5 million higher. Because the plan provisions include caps on company per capita costs, healthcare cost inflation rate assumptions do not materially impact the net expense recorded. The Company also adopted the balance sheet recognition provisions of SFAS 158 effective December 31, 2006, as more fully described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, together with Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation (FIN) 47, Accounting for Conditional Asset Retirement Obligations, provides guidance for recording and disclosing liabilities related to future legally enforceable obligations to retire assets (ARO). SFAS 143 applies to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of long lived tangible assets that result from their acquisition, construction, development and normal operation. Because such obligation relates primarily to the Companys regulated utility operations, SFAS 143 and FIN 47 have no significant impact on results of operations. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has recorded an ARO of $93 million for nuclear plant decommissioning (as discussed above) and an ARO of $199 million for other conditional obligations related to generation, transmission and distribution properties, including gas pipelines. The ARO for nuclear plant decommissioning reflects a reduction of $46 million from the corresponding ARO recorded as of December 31, 2005. The reduction is primarily related to the expectation of lower decommissioning cost escalations than had been assumed in the prior cash flow analysis. All of the amounts recorded in connection with SFAS 143 and FIN 47 are based upon estimates which are subject to varying degrees of imprecision, particularly since such payments will be made many years in the future. Changes in these estimates will be recorded over time; however, these changes in estimates are not expected to materially impact results of operations so long as the regulatory framework for the Companys utilities remains in place. OTHER MATTERS Off Balance Sheet Financing Although SCANA invests in securities and business ventures, it does not hold investments in unconsolidated special purpose entities such as those described in SFAS 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, or as described in FIN 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. SCANA does not engage in off balance sheet financing or similar transactions, although it is party to incidental operating leases in the normal course of business, generally for office space, furniture and equipment. Claims and Litigation For a description of claims and litigation see Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. ITEM 7A.

See Note 9 to the consolidated financial statements. Table of Contents The NYMEX futures information above includes those financial positions of Energy Marketing, SCE&G and PSNC Energy. SCE&Gs tariffs include a purchased gas adjustment (PGA) clause that provides for the recovery of actual gas costs incurred. The SCPSC has ruled that the results of these hedging activities are to be included in the PGA. As such, costs of related derivatives utilized by SCE&G to hedge gas purchasing activities are recoverable through the weighted average cost of gas calculation. The offset to the change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded as a regulatory asset or liability. PSNC Energy utilizes futures, options and swaps to hedge gas purchasing activities. PSNC Energys tariffs include a provision for the recovery of actual gas costs incurred. PSNC Energy records premiums, transaction fees, margin requirements and any realized and unrealized gains or losses from its hedging program in deferred accounts as a regulatory asset or liability for the over or under recovery of gas costs.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW South Carolina Electric & Gas Company (SCE&G, together with its consolidated affiliates, the Company) is a regulated public utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and in the purchase and sale, primarily at retail, of natural gas. SCE&Gs business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Generally, sales of electricity are higher during the summer and winter months because of air conditioning and heating requirements, and sales of natural gas are greater in the winter months due to heating requirements. SCE&Gs electric service territory extends into 24 counties covering nearly 17,000 square miles in the central, southern and southwestern portions of South Carolina. The service area for natural gas encompasses all or part of 35 counties in South Carolina and covers more than 23,000 square miles. Key earnings drivers for SCE&G over the next five years will be additions to utility rate base, consisting primarily of capital expenditures for environmental facilities, new generating capacity and system expansion. Other factors that will impact future earnings growth include the regulatory environment, customer growth and controlling the growth of operation and maintenance expenses. Electric Operations The electric operations segment is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, South Carolina Generating Company, Inc. (GENCO) and South Carolina Fuel Company, Inc. (Fuel Company), and is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity in South Carolina. At December 31, 2006 SCE&G provided electricity to 623,400 customers. GENCO owns and operates a coal fired generation station and sells electricity solely to SCE&G. Fuel Company acquires, owns and provides financing for SCE&Gs nuclear fuel, fossil fuel and emission allowance requirements. Both GENCO and Fuel Company are consolidated with SCE&G for financial reporting purposes. Operating results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for electricity, the ability to control costs and rates allowed to be charged to customers. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity. In January 2005, as a result of an electric rate case, SCE&Gs allowed return on equity was lowered from 12.45% to an amount not to exceed 11.4%, with rates set at 10.7%. Demand for electricity is primarily affected by weather, customer growth and the economy. SCE&G is able to recover the cost of fuel used in electric generation through retail customers bills, but increases in fuel costs affect electric prices and, therefore, the competitive position of electricity against other energy sources. Legislative and regulatory initiatives, including the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (the Energy Policy Act) also could significantly impact the results of operations and cash flows for the electric operations segment. The Energy Policy Act became law in August 2005, and it provides, among other things, for the establishment of an electric reliability organization (ERO) to propose and enforce mandatory reliability standards for transmission systems, for procedures governing enforcement actions by the ERO and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) and for procedures under which the ERO may delegate authority to a regional entity to enforce reliability standards. In February 2006 FERC issued final rules to implement the electric reliability provisions of the Energy Policy Act. The Company is reviewing these rules and monitoring their implementation to determine the impact they may have on SCE&Gs access to or cost of power for its native load customers and for its marketing of power outside its service territory. The Company cannot predict when or if FERC will advance other regulatory initiatives related to the national energy market or what conditions such initiatives would impose on utilities. New legislation may also impose stringent requirements on power plants to reduce emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and mercury. It is also possible that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The Company cannot predict whether such legislation will be enacted, and if it is, the conditions it would impose on utilities. Gas Distribution The gas distribution segment is comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G and is primarily engaged in the purchase and sale of natural gas to retail customers in portions of South Carolina. At December 31, 2006 this segment provided natural gas to approximately 297,000 customers. Table of Contents Operating results for gas distribution are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas, the ability to control costs and allowed rates to be charged to customers. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity. This allowed return on equity is 10.25%. Demand for natural gas is primarily affected by weather, customer growth, the economy and, for commercial and industrial customers, the availability and price of alternate fuels. Natural gas competes with electricity, propane and heating oil to serve the heating and, to a lesser extent, other household energy needs of residential and small commercial customers. This competition is generally based on price and convenience. Large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel, such as propane or fuel oil. Natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price. As a result, any significant disparity between supply and demand, either of natural gas or of alternate fuels, and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors, will affect price and impact SCE&Gs ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers. Significant supply disruptions did occur in September and October 2005 as a result of hurricane activity in the Gulf of Mexico, resulting in the curtailment during the period of most large commercial and industrial customers with interruptible supply agreements. While supply disruptions were not experienced in 2006 or in January or February 2007, the price of natural gas remains volatile and has resulted in short term competitive pressure. The long term impact of volatile gas prices and gas supply has not been determined. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Income Net income was as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Net income $ 234.6 (9.1 )% $ 258.1 11.0 % $ 232.5 2006 vs 2005 Net income decreased primarily due to lower electric margin of $7.8 million, increased electric generation, transmission and distribution expenses of $6.9 million, increased gas distribution expenses of $1.9 million, a settlement related to power marketing practices of $8.7 million (see Note 10E of the consolidated financial statements), lower pension income and other postretirement benefits of $2.8 million, increased customer service expenses of $1.2 million and increased property taxes of $3.7 million. These increases were partially offset by higher gas margins of $10.5 million and lower incentive compensation expense of $8.6 million. 2005 vs 2004 Net income increased primarily due to higher electric and gas margins of $50.8 million and $5.1 million, respectively, and due to the recognition of carrying cost recovery of $10.9 million on the dam remediation project (see Income Taxes Recognition of Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits). These increases were offset by higher major maintenance expenses of $4.1 million, higher depreciation and amortization expense of $16.1 million, increased interest expense of $3.3 million, increased expenses of $5.5 million associated with the Jasper County Electric Generation Station completed in May 2004, lower equity AFC of $14.3 million and higher other expenses of $2.3 million. Pension Income Pension income was recorded on SCE&Gs financial statements as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 2005 2004 Income Statement Impact: Reduction in employee benefit costs $ 2.4 $ 5.6 $ 4.2 Other income 12.7 12.2 11.0 Balance Sheet Impact: Reduction in capital expenditures 0.7 1.6 1.2 Component of amount due to Summer Station co owner 0.2 0.6 0.4 Total Pension Income $ 16.0 $ 20.0 $ 16.8 Table of Contents For the last several years, the market value of SCE&Gs retirement plan (pension) assets has exceeded the total actuarial present value of accumulated plan benefits. Among the reasons 2006s income was lower than 2005s was a reduction of the assumed rate of return on assets from 9.25% to 9%. See also the discussion of pension accounting in Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates. Allowance for Funds Used During Construction (AFC) AFC is a utility accounting practice whereby a portion of the cost of both equity and borrowed funds used to finance construction (which is shown on the balance sheet as construction work in progress) is capitalized. The Company includes an equity portion of AFC in nonoperating income and a debt portion of AFC in interest charges (credits) as noncash items, both of which have the effect of increasing reported net income. AFC represented approximately 2.2% of income before income taxes in 2006, 1.5% in 2005 and 6.5% in 2004. The lower level of AFC for 2005 is primarily due to reductions in the levels of capital expenditures subsequent to the completion of the Jasper County Electric Generation Station in May 2004 and completion of the Lake Murray back up dam project in May 2005. Dividends Declared SCE&Gs Board of Directors has declared the following dividends on common stock held by SCANA during 2006: Declaration Date Dividend Amount Quarter Ended Payment Date February 16, 2006 $39.2 million March 31, 2006 April 1, 2006 April 27, 2006 $39.2 million June 30, 2006 July 1, 2006 August 3, 2006 $39.2 million September 30, 2006 October 1, 2006 November 1, 2006 $21.0 million December 31, 2006 January 1, 2007 Electric Operations Electric Operations is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, GENCO and Fuel Company. Electric operations sales margins were as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Operating revenues $ 1,886.6 (1.3 )% $ 1,912.0 13.0 % $ 1,692.0 Less: Fuel used in generation 615.1 (0.5 )% 618.1 32.4 % 466.9 Purchased power 27.5 (26.1 )% 37.2 (26.6 )% 50.7 Margin $ 1,244.0 (1.0 )% $ 1,256.7 7.0 % $ 1,174.4 2006 vs 2005 Margin decreased by $20.8 million due to unfavorable weather, by $16.0 million due to decreased off system sales and by $6.5 million due to lower industrial sales. These decreases were offset by residential and commercial customer growth of $26.5 million and increased other electric revenue of $4.1 million. Purchased power cost decreased due to lower volumes. 2005 vs 2004 Margin increased by $41.4 million due to increased retail electric rates that went into effect in January 2005, by $24.8 million due to residential and commercial customer growth and by $16.4 million due to increased off system sales. These increases were offset by a $2.4 million decrease due to unfavorable weather. Fuel used in generation increased $151.2 million due primarily to the increased cost of coal and natural gas used for electric generation. Purchased power cost decreased due to greater availability of generation facilities. Table of Contents Megawatt hour (MWh) sales volumes by class, related to the electric margin above, were as follows: Classification (in thousands) 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Residential 7,598 (0.5 )% 7,634 2.3 % 7,460 Commercial 7,268 1.9 % 7,135 3.1 % 6,919 Industrial 6,183 (6.0 )% 6,581 (2.9 )% 6,775 Sales for resale (excluding interchange) 1,487 1,487 (2.5 )% 1,525 Other 531 0.8 % 527 0.2 % 526 Total territorial 23,067 (1.3 )% 23,364 0.7 % 23,205 Negotiated Market Sales Tariff (NMST) 1,475 (24.9 )% 1,963 (6.4 )% 1,845 Total 24,542 (3.1 )% 25,327 1.1 % 25,050 2006 vs 2005 Territorial sales volumes decreased by 307 MWh due to lower industrial sales volumes and by 406 MWh due to unfavorable weather. These decreases were partially offset by 408 MWh due to residential and commercial customer growth. 2005 vs 2004 Territorial sales volumes increased by 407 MWh primarily due to customer growth partially offset by 261 MWh due to less favorable weather. Gas Distribution Gas Distribution is comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G. Gas distribution sales margins (including transactions with affiliates) were as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Operating revenues $ 504.6 (0.8 )% $ 508.8 28.0 % $ 397.4 Less: Gas purchased for resale 395.5 (5.1 )% 416.6 32.8 % 313.6 Margin $ 109.1 18.3 % $ 92.2 10.0 % $ 83.8 2006 vs 2005 Margin increased by $17.5 million due to increased retail gas base rates which became effective with the first billing cycle in November 2005 and by $4.0 million due to an SCPSC approved increase in retail gas base rates effective with the first billing cycle in November 2006. These increases were offset by $4.0 million due to lower firm margin resulting from customer conservation. 2005 vs 2004 Margin increased by $4.7 million due to higher firm margin and by $4.6 million due to increased retail gas base rates which became effective with the first billing cycle in November 2005. These increases were offset by a $0.8 million decrease due to lower interruptible margin and transportation revenue. Dekatherm (DT) sales volumes by class, including transportation gas, were as follows: Classification (in thousands) 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Residential 10,926 (14.7 )% 12,806 (0.9 )% 12,916 Commercial 11,984 (4.5 )% 12,553 3.3 % 12,155 Industrial 17,879 12.4 % 15,907 5.4 % 15,087 Transportation gas 2,484 22.2 % 2,032 (10.6 )% 2,272 Total 43,273 (0.1 )% 43,298 2.0 % 42,430 2006 vs 2005 Residential and commercial sales volumes decreased primarily due to milder weather and conservation. Industrial and transportation sales volumes increased due to the competitive position of gas relative to alternate fuel sources. 2005 vs 2004 Commercial and industrial sales volumes increased primarily due to more customers buying commodity gas instead of purchasing alternate fuels and instead of transporting gas purchased from others. Table of Contents Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses, which arose from the operating segments previously discussed, were as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Other operation and maintenance $ 460.7 4.4 % $ 441.2 2.4 % $ 431.0 Depreciation and amortization 285.8 (38.5 )% 464.8 * 220.9 Other taxes 137.8 5.2 % 131.0 (0.2 )% 131.3 Total $ 884.3 (14.7 )% $ 1,037.0 32.4 % $ 783.2 * Greater than 100% 2006 vs 2005 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased by $11.1 million primarily due to increased electric generation, transmission and distribution expenses, by $3.1 million due to increased gas distribution expenses, by $4.6 million due to lower pension income and other postretirement benefits and by $2.0 million due to higher customer service expenses. These increases were partially offset by $13.9 million due to decreased incentive compensation expense. Depreciation and amortization expense decreased by $185.8 million due to lower accelerated depreciation of the back up dam at Lake Murray in 2006 compared to 2005 (see Income Taxes Recognition of Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits), partially offset by $6.7 million due to property additions and higher depreciation rates. Other taxes increased primarily due to higher property taxes of $6.0 million. 2005 vs 2004 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased by $11.5 million due to increased electric generation, transmission and distribution expenses, higher expenses related to regulatory matters of $1.9 million and higher amortization of regulatory assets of $3.6 million. The increases were offset primarily by decreased long term bonus and incentive plan expenses of $4.8 million and decreased storm damage expenses of $0.9 million. Depreciation and amortization increased approximately $214.0 million due to accelerated depreciation of the back up dam at Lake Murray (see Income Taxes Recognition of Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits), increased $6.5 million due to the completion of the Jasper County Electric Generating Station in May 2004 and increased $6.1 million due to normal net property changes. In addition, pursuant to the January 2005 rate order, SCE&G began amortization of previously deferred purchased power costs and implemented new depreciation rates, resulting in $17.3 million of additional depreciation and amortization expense in the period. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) includes the results of certain non utility activities. Components of other income (expense), were as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Gain on sale of assets $ 3.0 76.5 % $ 1.7 21.4 % $ 1.4 Other revenues 60.8 (62.4 )% 162.4 57.5 % 103.1 Other expenses (45.1 ) (67.9 )% (140.7 ) 55.1 % (90.7 ) Total $ 18.7 (20.1 )% $ 23.4 69.6 % $ 13.8 2006 vs 2005 Other revenues decreased $91.5 million due to lower power marketing activities, $10.8 million due to the termination of a contract to operate a steam combustion turbine at the United States Department of Energy (DOE) Savannah River Site and by $4.3 million due to lower carrying costs recognized on the unrecovered balance of the Lake Murray back up dam project as discussed at Income Taxes Recognition of Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits below. These decreases were partially offset by higher interest income of $8.7 million and higher third party coal sales revenue of $4.8 million. Other expenses decreased by $90.6 million due to lower power marketing activities and $4.4 million due to the termination of the DOEs Savannah River Site contract. These decreases were partially offset by increased charges of $8.7 million related to the settlement of the FERC power marketing matter (see Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements) and higher expenses to support third party coal sales of $3.6 million. 2005 vs 2004 Other revenues increased $42.8 million due to higher power marketing activity and $10.9 million due to carrying costs recognized on the unrecovered balance of the Lake Murray back up dam project. Other expenses increased $43.1 million due to higher power marketing activity and $.8 million due to the charge associated with the FERC power marketing matter. (See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements.) Interest Expense Components of interest expense, excluding the debt component of AFC, were as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 % Change 2005 % Change 2004 Interest on long term debt, net $ 123.9 (7.1 )% $ 133.3 (0.2 )% $ 135.4 Other interest expense 16.1 46.4 % 11.0 * 3.5 Total $ 140.0 (3.0 )% $ 144.3 3.9 % $ 138.9 * Greater than 100% 2006 vs 2005 Interest on long term debt decreased primarily due to lower interest rates and the redemption of outstanding debt in 2005. Other interest expense increased primarily due to higher principal balances and interest rates on short term debt. 2005 vs 2004 Interest on long term debt decreased primarily due to the redemption of outstanding debt. Other interest expense increased primarily due to increased short term debt. Income Taxes Income taxes increased approximately $237.6 million for the year 2006 compared to 2005 and decreased approximately $269.9 million for the year 2005 compared to 2004. Changes in income taxes are primarily due to changes in operating income, and due to the recognition of $30.0 million in synthetic fuel tax credits in 2006 compared to $179.0 million in 2005 pursuant to the January 2005 electric rate order. SCE&Gs effective tax rate has been favorably impacted in recent years by the flow through of state investment tax credits and the equity portion of AFC. Recognition of Synthetic Fuel Tax Credits SCE&G holds equity method investments in two partnerships involved in converting coal to synthetic fuel, the use of which fuel qualifies for federal income tax credits. Under an accounting plan approved by the Public Service Commission of South Carolina (SCPSC) in June 2000, the synthetic fuel tax credits generated by the partnerships and passed through to SCE&G, net of partnership losses and other expenses, were deferred until the SCPSC approved its application to offset capital costs of the Lake Murray back up dam project. Under the accounting methodology approved by the SCPSC in a January 2005 order, construction costs related to the project were recorded in utility plant in service in a special dam remediation account outside of rate base, and depreciation is being recognized against the balance in this account on an accelerated basis, subject to the availability of the synthetic fuel tax credits. Table of Contents The level of depreciation expense and related tax benefit recognized in the income statement is equal to the available synthetic fuel tax credits, less partnership losses and other expenses, net of taxes. As a result, the balance of unrecovered costs in the dam remediation account declines as accelerated depreciation is recorded. Although these entries collectively have no impact on consolidated net income, they have a significant impact on individual line items within the income statement. The accelerated depreciation, synthetic fuel tax credits, partnership losses and the income tax benefit arising from such losses recognized by SCE&G during 2006 and 2005 are as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 2005 Depreciation and amortization expense $ (28.2 ) $ (214.0 ) Income tax benefits: From synthetic fuel tax credits 30.0 179.0 From accelerated depreciation 10.8 81.8 From partnership losses 7.8 28.9 Total income tax benefits 48.6 289.7 Losses from Equity Method Investments (20.4 ) (75.7 ) Impact on Net Income The 2005 amounts above reflect the recognition of previously deferred tax credits, while the 2006 amounts reflect the likelihood that credits available in 2006 will be phased down pursuant to regulations which limit the credits based on the relative commodity price of crude oil. Depreciation on the Lake Murray back up dam project account will be matched to available synthetic fuel tax credits on a quarterly basis until the balance in the dam remediation account is zero or until all of the available synthetic fuel tax credits have been utilized. The synthetic fuel tax credit program expires at the end of 2007. The availability of the synthetic fuel tax credits is dependent on several factors, one of which is the average annual domestic wellhead price per barrel of crude oil as published by the U.S. Government. Under a phase out provision included in the program, if the domestic wellhead reference price of oil per barrel for a given year is below an inflation adjusted benchmark range for that year, all of the synthetic fuel tax credits that have been generated in that year would be available for use. If that price is above the benchmark range, none of the tax credits would be available. If that price falls within the benchmark range, a calculated portion of the credits would be available. The benchmark price range for 2005, published in April 2006, was $53 to $67 per barrel, and no phase out applied. However, SCE&Gs analysis indicates that the available synthetic fuel tax credits for 2006 are likely to be impacted by the phase out calculation. As such, in 2006 the Company recorded synthetic fuel tax credits and applied those credits to allow the recording of accelerated depreciation related to the balance in the dam remediation project account based on an estimate that only 67% of credits generated will be available (phase out of 33%). The Company cannot predict what impact, if any, the price of oil may have on the Companys ability to earn and utilize synthetic fuel tax credits in the future. However, there is significant uncertainty as to the continued availability of the credits in 2007. The availability of these synthetic fuel tax credits is also subject to coal availability and other operational risks related to the generating plants. The Company does not expect available credits to be sufficient to fully recover the construction costs of dam remediation, and total unrecovered cost at the end of December 31, 2007 may be significant. To the extent that available credits are not sufficient to fully recover the construction costs of the dam remediation, regulatory action to allow recovery of those remaining costs may be sought. As of December 31, 2006, remaining unrecovered costs, based on managements recording of accelerated depreciation and related tax benefits, were $69.1 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Companys cash requirements arise primarily from its operational needs, funding its construction programs and payment of dividends to SCANA. The ability of the Company to replace existing plant investment, to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas and to install equipment necessary to comply with environmental regulations, will depend upon its ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms. SCE&G recovers the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers. Rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs. As customer growth and inflation occur and SCE&G continues its ongoing construction program, SCE&G expects to seek increases in rates. The Companys future financial position and results of operations will be affected by SCE&Gs ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief, if requested. SCE&G expects to require the addition of base load electrical generation by 2015 and is evaluating alternatives, including fossil and nuclear fueled generation facilities. In February 2006, SCE&G and the South Carolina Public Service Authority (Santee Cooper), a state owned utility in South Carolina (joint owners of V. C. Summer Nuclear Station (Summer Station)), announced their selection of the Summer Station site as the preferred site for new nuclear generation facilities should such generation be considered the best alternative in the future. Due to the significant lead time required for construction of nuclear generation facilities, the joint owners are preparing an application to the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) for a combined construction and operating license (COL) that would cover two nuclear units. The COL application, which is expected to be completed and filed in 2007, would be reviewed by the NRC for an estimated three years. Issuance of a COL would not obligate the joint owners to build nuclear generation facilities. The final decision to build nuclear generation facilities will be influenced by several factors, including NRC licensing attainment, estimates of construction and operating costs, the cost of competing fuels, regulatory and environmental requirements and financial market conditions. The Companys current estimates of its capital expenditures for construction and nuclear fuel for 2007 2009, which are subject to continuing review and adjustment, are as follows: Estimated Capital Expenditures Millions of dollars 2007 2008 2009 SCE&G: Electric Plant: Generation (including GENCO) $ 220 $ 361 $ 255 Transmission 45 52 35 Distribution 151 155 153 Other 28 38 17 Nuclear Fuel 55 6 26 Gas 50 59 52 Common and Other 28 10 12 Total $ 577 $ 681 $ 550 The Companys contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2006 are summarized as follows: Contractual Cash Obligations Millions of dollars Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years After 5 years Long term and short term debt (including interest and preferred stock) $ 4,559 $ 493 $ 499 $ 377 $ 3,190 Capital leases 2 1 1 Operating leases 49 27 22 Purchase obligations 278 199 76 2 1 Other commercial commitments 1,432 490 821 29 92 Total $ 6,320 $ 1,210 $ 1,419 $ 408 $ 3,283 Included in other commercial commitments are estimated obligations for coal and nuclear fuel purchases. See Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Included in purchase obligations are customary purchase orders under which SCE&G has the option to utilize certain vendors without the obligation to do so. SCE&G may terminate such obligations without penalty. The Company also has a legal obligation associated with the decommissioning and dismantling of Summer Station and other conditional asset retirement obligations that are not listed in the contractual cash obligations above. See Notes 1B and 10H to the consolidated financial statements. In addition to the contractual cash obligations above, SCANA sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan and an unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plan for retirees. The pension plan is adequately funded, and no further contributions are anticipated until after 2010. The Companys cash payments under the health care and life insurance benefit plan were $7.3 million in 2006, and such annual payments are expected to increase to the $10 $11 million range in the future. The Company anticipates that its contractual cash obligations will be met through internally generated funds, the incurrence of additional short term and long term indebtedness and capital contributions from its parent, SCANA. The Company expects that it has or can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet its projected cash requirements for the foreseeable future. Cash outlays for 2006 (actual) and 2007 (estimated) for certain expenditures are as follows: Millions of dollars 2006 2007 Property additions and construction expenditures, net of AFC $ 412 $ 522 Nuclear fuel expenditures 17 55 Investments 22 19 Total $ 451 $ 596 Financing Limits and Related Matters The Companys issuance of various securities, including long term and short term debt, is subject to customary approval or authorization by regulatory bodies including the SCPSC and FERC. Financing programs currently utilized by the Company are as follows. Pursuant to Section 204 of the Federal Power Act, SCE&G and GENCO must obtain FERC authority to issue short term debt. Effective February 8, 2006 the FERC has authorized SCE&G and GENCO to issue up to $700 million and $100 million, respectively, of unsecured promissory notes or commercial paper with maturity dates of one year or less. This authorization expires February 7, 2008. At December 31, 2006, SCE&G and Fuel Company had available the following lines of credit and short term borrowings outstanding: Millions of dollars Lines of credit (total and unused): SCE&G and Fuel Company Committed long term (expires December 2011) $ 650 Uncommitted (a) 78 Short term borrowings outstanding: Commercial paper (270 or fewer days) $ 362.2 Weighted average interest rate 5.38 % (a) Line of credit that either SCE&G or SCANA may use. In September 2006 SCE&G discharged its bond indenture dated January 1, 1945 which covered substantially all of its properties. SCE&G remains subject to a bond indenture dated April 1, 1993 (Mortgage) covering substantially all of its electric properties under which all of its currently outstanding First Mortgage Bonds and all of its future mortgage backed debt (Bonds) has been and will be issued. Bonds may be issued under the Mortgage in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the sum of (1) 70% of Unfunded Net Property Additions (as therein defined), (2) the aggregate principal amount of retired Bonds and (3) cash deposited with the trustee. Bonds will be issuable under the Mortgage only if Adjusted Net Earnings (as therein defined) for 12 consecutive months out of the 18 months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least twice the annual interest requirements on all outstanding Bonds and Bonds to be outstanding (Bond Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Bond Ratio was 6.99. SCE&Gs Restated Articles of Incorporation (Articles) prohibit issuance of additional shares of preferred stock without the consent of the preferred shareholders unless net earnings (as therein defined) for the 12 consecutive months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least one and one half times the aggregate of all interest charges and preferred stock dividend requirements on all shares of preferred stock outstanding immediately after the proposed issue (Preferred Stock Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2006, the Preferred Stock Ratio was 1.99. The Articles also require the consent of a majority of the total voting power of SCE&Gs preferred stock before SCE&G may issue or assume any unsecured indebtedness if, after such issue or assumption, the total principal amount of all such unsecured indebtedness would exceed ten percent of the aggregate principal amount of all of SCE&Gs secured indebtedness and capital and surplus (the ten percent test). No such consent is required to enter into agreements for payment of principal, interest and premium for securities issued for pollution control purposes. At December 31, 2006, the ten percent test would have limited total issuances of unsecured indebtedness to approximately $428.4 million. Unsecured indebtedness at December 31, 2006, totaled approximately $357.8 million, and was comprised primarily of short term borrowings. Financing Cash Flows During 2006 the Company experienced net cash outflows related to financing activities of approximately $38 million primarily due to the payment of dividends to SCANA, which were partially offset by net increases in short term borrowings. In anticipation of the issuance of debt, the Company may use interest rate lock or similar agreements to manage interest rate risk. Payments received or made upon termination of such agreements are recorded within long term debt on the balance sheet and are amortized to interest expense over the term of the underlying debt. In connection with the issuance of first mortgage bonds in June 2006, SCE&G received approximately $8.8 million upon the termination of an interest rate lock. These proceeds are being amortized over the life of the related debt, thereby reducing its effective interest rate. As permitted by SFAS 104 Statement of Cash Flows Net Reporting of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments and Classification of Cash Flows from Hedging Transactions, these proceeds have been classified as a financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. For additional information on significant financing transactions, see Note 4 to the Companys consolidated financial statements. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Capital Expenditures For the three years ended December 31, 2006, the Companys capital expenditures for environmental control totaled $160.2 million. These expenditures were in addition to environmental expenditures included in Other operation and maintenance expenses, which were $28.1 million, $25.2 million, and $21.3 million during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively. It is not possible to estimate all future costs related to environmental matters, but forecasts for capitalized environmental expenditures for the Company are $154.6 million for 2007 and $494.6 million for the four year period 2008 through 2011. These expenditures are included in the Companys construction program discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources, and include the matters discussed below. Electric Operations In March 2005, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a final rule known as the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR). CAIR requires the District of Columbia and 28 states, including South Carolina, to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in order to attain mandated state levels. SCE&G has petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review CAIR. Several other electric utilities have filed separate petitions. The petitioners seek a change in the method CAIR uses to allocate sulfur dioxide emission allowances to a method the petitioners believe is more equitable. The Company believes that installation of additional air quality controls will be needed to meet the CAIR requirements. The Company is reviewing the final rule. Compliance plans and cost to comply with the rule will be determined once the Company completes its review. Such costs will to be material and are expected to be recoverable through rates. In March 2005, the EPA issued a final rule establishing a mercury emissions cap and trade program for coal fired power plants that requires limits to be met in two phases, in 2010 and 2018. Although the Company expects to be able to meet the Phase I limits through those measures it already will be taking to meet its CAIR obligations, it is uncertain as to how the Phase II limits will be met. Assuming Phase II limits remain unchanged, installation of additional air quality controls likely will be required to comply with the rules Phase II mercury emission caps. Final compliance plans and costs to comply with the rule are still under review. Such costs will be material and are expected to be recoverable through rates. The EPA has undertaken an aggressive enforcement initiative against the utilities industry, and the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) has brought suit against a number of utilities in federal court alleging violations of the Clean Air Act (CAA). At least two of these suits have either been tried or have had substantive motions decidedone favorable to the industry and one not. The one not favorable to the industry is not binding as precedent and the one favorable to the industry likely is precedent and is consistent with current Company interpretation of the law and its resulting maintenance practices. Prior to the suits, those utilities had received requests for information under Section 114 of the CAA and were issued Notices of Violation. The basis for these suits is the assertion by the EPA, under a stringent rule known as New Source Review (NSR), that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities over the past 20 or more years constitute major modifications which would have required the installation of costly Best Available Control Technology (BACT). SCE&G and GENCO have received and responded to Section 114 requests for information related to Canadys, Wateree and Williams Stations. The regulations under the CAA provide certain exemptions to the definition of major modifications, including an exemption for routine repair, replacement or maintenance. On October 27, 2003, EPA published a final revised NSR rule in the Federal Register with an effective date of December 26, 2003. The rule represents an industry favorable departure from certain positions advanced by the federal government in the NSR enforcement initiative. However, on motion of several Northeastern states, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stayed the effect of the final rule. The ultimate application of the final rule to the Company is uncertain. The Company has analyzed each of the activities covered by the EPAs requests and believes each of these activities is covered by the exemption for routine repair, replacement and maintenance under what it believes is a fair reading of both the prior regulation and the contested revised regulation. The regulations also provide an exemption for an increase in emissions resulting from increased hours of operation or production rate and from demand growth. The current state of continued DOJ enforcement actions is the subject of industry wide speculation, but it is possible that the EPA will commence enforcement actions against the Company, and the EPA has the authority to seek penalties at the rate of up to $27,500 per day for each violation. The EPA also could seek installation of BACT (or equivalent) at the three plants. The Company believes that any enforcement actions relative to the Companys compliance with the CAA would be without merit. The Company has completed installation of selective catalytic reactors at Wateree and Williams for nitrogen oxides control and is proceeding with plans to install sulfur dioxide scrubbers at both of these stations to meet CAIR regulations. These actions would mitigate many of the concerns with NSR. The Company expects to incur capital expenditures totaling approximately $450 million over the 2007 2010 period to install this new equipment. The Company expects to have increased operation and maintenance costs of approximately $4 million in 2010 and $27 million in 2011 and subsequent years. To meet compliance requirements for the years 2012 through 2016, the Company anticipates additional capital expenditures totaling approximately $480 million. The Clean Water Act, as amended, provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require treatment for wastewater discharges. Under the Clean Water Act, compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program. Discharge permits have been issued for all, and renewed for nearly all, of SCE&Gs and GENCOs generating units. Concurrent with renewal of these permits, the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program of monitoring and controlling discharges, has modified the requirements for cooling water intake structures, and has required strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams. The Company is conducting studies and is developing or implementing compliance plans for these initiatives. Congress is expected to consider further amendments to the Clean Water Act. Such legislation may include limitations to mixing zones and toxicity based standards. These provisions, if passed, could have a material adverse impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company. The Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (Nuclear Waste Act) required that the United States government, by January 31, 1998, accept and permanently dispose of high level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel. The Nuclear Waste Act also imposed on utilities the primary responsibility for storage of their spent nuclear fuel until the repository is available. SCE&G entered into a Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and or High Level Radioactive Waste (Standard Contract) with the DOE in 1983 providing for permanent disposal of its spent nuclear fuel in exchange for agreed payments fixed in the Standard Contract at particular amounts. On January 28, 2004, SCE&G and Santee Cooper (one third owner of Summer Station) filed suit in the Court of Federal Claims against the DOE for breach of the Standard Contract, because as of the date of filing, the federal government had accepted no spent fuel from Summer Station or any other utility for transport and disposal, and has indicated that it does not anticipate doing so until 2010, at the earliest. As a consequence of the federal governments breach of contract, the plaintiffs have incurred and will continue to incur substantial costs. On January 9, 2006, SCE&G and Santee Cooper accepted a $9 million settlement from DOE. The payment reimbursed the plaintiffs for certain costs incurred from January 31, 1998 through July 31, 2005. SCE&G recorded its portion ($6 million) of the settlement as a reduction to its fuel costs. As a result, most of the credit was passed through to its customers through the fuel clause component of its retail electric rates. The settlement also provides for the plaintiffs to submit an annual application to DOE for the reimbursement of certain costs incurred subsequent to July 31, 2005. SCE&G has on site spent nuclear fuel storage capability until at least 2018 and expects to be able to expand its storage capacity to accommodate the spent nuclear fuel output for the life of the plant through dry cask storage or other technology as it becomes available. SCE&G has been named, along with 29 others, by the EPA as a potentially responsible party (PRP) at the Carolina Transformer Superfund site located in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The Carolina Transformer Company (CTC) conducted an electrical transformer rebuilding and repair operation at the site from 1967 to 1984. During that time, SCE&G occasionally used CTC for the repair of existing transformers, purchase of new transformers and sale of used transformers. In 1984, EPA initiated a cleanup of PCB contaminated soil and groundwater at the site. EPA reports that it has spent $36 million to date. Although a basis for the allocation of clean up costs among the PRPs is unclear, SCE&G does not believe that its involvement at this site would result in an allocation of costs that would have a material adverse impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Any cost allocated to SCE&G arising from the remediation of this site, net of insurance recoveries, if any, is expected to be recoverable through rates. SCE&G has been named, along with 53 others, by the EPA as a PRP at the Alternate Energy Resources, Inc. (AER) Superfund site located in Augusta, Georgia. The EPA placed the site on the National Priorities List on April 19, 2006. AER conducted hazardous waste storage and treatment operations from 1975 to 2000, when the site was abandoned. While operational, AER processed fuels from waste oils, treated industrial coolants and oil/water emulsions, recycled solvents and blended hazardous waste fuels. During that time, SCE&G occasionally used AER for the processing of waste solvents, oily rags and oily wastewater. EPA and the State of Georgia have documented that a release or releases have occurred at the site leading to contamination of groundwater, surface water and soils. EPA and the State of Georgia have conducted a preliminary assessment and site inspection. The site has not been cleaned up nor has a cleanup cost been estimated. Although a basis for the allocation of clean up costs among the PRPs is unclear, SCE&G does not believe that its involvement at this site would result in an allocation of costs that would have a material adverse impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. Any cost allocated to SCE&G arising from the remediation of this site, net of insurance recoveries, if any, is expected to be recoverable through rates. Gas Distribution The Company maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could require environmental cleanup. As site assessments are initiated, estimates are made of the amount of expenditures, if any, deemed necessary to investigate and clean up each site. These estimates are refined as additional information becomes available; therefore, actual expenditures may differ significantly from the original estimates. Amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and cleanup relate solely to regulated operations and are recorded in deferred debits and amortized with recovery provided through rates. Deferred amounts, net of amounts previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements, totaled $17.9 million and $17.7 million at December 31, 2006 and 2005, respectively. The deferral includes the estimated costs associated with the following matters. SCE&G owns a decommissioned MGP site in the Calhoun Park area of Charleston, South Carolina. SCE&G anticipates that remediation for contamination at the site will be completed in late 2007, with certain monitoring and retreatment activities continuing until 2011. As of December 31, 2006, SCE&G has spent $22.3 million to remediate the Calhoun Park site, and expects to spend an additional $1.1 million. In addition, the National Park Service of the Department of the Interior made an initial demand to SCE&G for payment of $9.1 million for certain costs and damages relating to this site. SCE&G expects to recover any cost arising from the remediation of this site through rates. SCE&G owns three other decommissioned MGP sites in South Carolina which contain residues of by product chemicals. One of the sites has been remediated and will undergo routine monitoring until released by DHEC. The other sites are currently being investigated under work plans approved by DHEC. SCE&G anticipates that major remediation activities for the three sites will be completed in 2011. As of December 31, 2006, SCE&G has spent $4.8 million related to these three sites, and expects to spend an additional $11.2 million. SCE&G expects to recover any cost arising from the remediation of this site through rates. REGULATORY MATTERS See earlier discussion of increases in retail electric and gas base rates during 2006 in Liquidity and Capital Resources. The Natural Gas Stabilization Act of 2005 allows natural gas distribution companies to request annual adjustments to rates to reflect changes in revenues and expenses and changes in investment. Such annual adjustments are subject to certain qualifying criteria and review by the SCPSC. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Following are descriptions of the Companys accounting policies and estimates which are most critical in terms of reporting financial condition or results of operations. Utility Regulation The Company is subject to the provisions of SFAS 71, Accounting for the Effects of Certain Types of Regulation, which requires it to record certain assets and liabilities that defer the recognition of expenses and revenues to future periods as a result of being rate regulated. In the future, as a result of deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment, the Company may no longer meet the criteria for continued application of SFAS 71 and could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities. Such an event could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations or financial position of the Companys Electric Distribution and Gas Distribution segments in the period the write off would be recorded. It is not expected that cash flows would be materially affected. See Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the Companys regulatory assets and liabilities, including those associated with the Companys environmental assessment program. The Companys generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market. If market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs, the Company could be required to write down its investment in those assets. The Company cannot predict whether any write downs will be necessary and, if they are, the extent to which they would adversely affect the Companys results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded. As of December 31, 2006, the Companys net investments in fossil/hydro and nuclear generation assets were $2.3 billion and $506 million, respectively. Revenue Recognition and Unbilled Revenues Revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual reading of their electric and gas meters, the Company records estimates for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. Such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to customers since the date of the last reading of their meters. Such unbilled revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class, the effects of different rate schedules, changes in weather and, where applicable, the impact of weather normalization provisions of rate structures. The accrual of unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs. As of December 31, 2006 and 2005, accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of $91.7 million and $99.7 million, respectively, compared to total revenues for each of the years 2006 and 2005 of $2.4 billion. Nuclear Decommissioning Accounting for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future. Among the factors that could change the Companys accounting estimates related to decommissioning costs are changes in technology, changes in regulatory and environmental remediation requirements, and changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and timing of cash flows. Changes in any of these estimates could significantly impact the Companys financial position and cash flows (although changes in such estimates should be earnings neutral, because these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers). SCE&Gs two thirds share of estimated site specific nuclear decommissioning costs for Summer Station, including both the cost of decommissioning plant components that are and are not subject to radioactive contamination, totals $451.0 million, stated in 2006 dollars, based on a decommissioning study completed in 2006. Santee Cooper is responsible for decommissioning costs related to its one third ownership interest in Summer Station. The cost estimate assumes that the site would be maintained over a period of 60 years in such a manner as to allow for subsequent decontamination that would permit release for unrestricted use. Under SCE&Gs method of funding decommissioning costs, amounts collected through rates are invested in insurance policies on the lives of certain Company personnel. SCE&G transfers to an external trust fund the amounts collected through electric rates, insurance proceeds, and interest on proceeds, less expenses. The trusteed asset balance reflects the net cash surrender value of the insurance policies held by the trust. Management intends for the fund, including earnings thereon, to provide for all eventual decommissioning expenditures on an after tax basis. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits SCANA follows SFAS 87, Employers Accounting for Pensions, as amended by SFAS 158, in accounting for the cost of its defined benefit pension plan. SCANAs plan is adequately funded and as such, net pension income is reflected in the financial statements (see Results of Operations). SFAS 87 requires the use of several assumptions, the selection of which may have a large impact on the resulting benefit recorded. Among the more sensitive assumptions are those surrounding discount rates and expected returns on assets. Net pension income of $15.8 million recorded in 2006 reflects the use of a 5.60% discount rate and an assumed 9.00% long term rate of return on plan assets. SCANA believes that these assumptions were, and that the resulting pension income amount was, reasonable. For purposes of comparison, using a discount rate of 5.35% in 2006 would have decreased the Companys share of SCANAs pension income by $0.9 million. Had the assumed long term rate of return on assets been 8.75%, the Companys share of SCANAs pension income for 2006 would have been reduced by $2.1 million. For 2006, SCANA selected the discount rate of 5.60% which was derived using a cash flow matching technique. For 2007, the discount rate to be used will be 5.85%, which was derived using that same cash flow matching technique. The same discount rates were also selected for determination of other postemployment benefits costs discussed below. The following information with respect to pension assets (and returns thereon) should also be noted. SCANA determines the fair value of substantially all of its pension assets utilizing market quotes rather than utilizing any calculated values, market related values or other modeling techniques. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumptions, SCANA evaluates input from actuaries and from pension fund investment consultants. Such consultants 2006 review of the plans historical 10, 15, 20 and 25 year cumulative performance showed actual returns of 9.3%, 11.0%, 11.2% and 12.7%, respectively, all of which have been in excess of related broad indices. The 2006 expected long term rate of return of 9.0% was based on a target asset allocation of 70% with equity managers and 30% with fixed income managers. Management regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate. For 2007, the expected rate of return will be 9.00%. The pension trust is adequately funded, and no contributions have been required since 1997. Management does not anticipate the need to make pension contributions until after 2010. Similar to its pension accounting, SCANA follows SFAS 106, Employers Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions, as amended by SFAS 158, in accounting for the cost of its postretirement medical and life insurance benefits. This plan is unfunded, so no assumptions related to rate of return on assets impact the net expense recorded; however, the selection of discount rates can significantly impact the actuarial determination of net expense. SCANA used a discount rate of 5.60% and recorded a net SFAS 106 cost of $16.8 million for 2006. Had the selected discount rate been 5.35%, the expense for 2006 would have been $0.4 million higher. The Company also adopted the balance sheet recognition provisions of SFAS 158 effective December 31, 2006, as more fully described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Because the plan provisions include caps on company per capita costs, healthcare cost inflation rate assumptions do not materially impact the net expense recorded. The Company also adopted the balance sheet recognition provisions of SFAS 158 effective December 31, 2006, as more fully described in Note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Asset Retirement Obligations SFAS 143, Accounting for Asset Retirement Obligations, together with FIN 47, provides guidance for recording and disclosing liabilities related to future legally enforceable obligations to retire assets (ARO). SFAS 143 applies to the legal obligation associated with the retirement of long lived tangible assets that result from their acquisition, construction, development and normal operation. Because such obligation relates to the Companys regulated utility operations, SFAS 143 and FIN 47 have no impact on results of operations. As of December 31, 2006, the Company has recorded an ARO of approximately $93 million for nuclear plant decommissioning (as discussed above) and an ARO of $186 million for other conditional obligations related to generation, transmission and distribution properties, including gas pipelines. The ARO for nuclear plant decommissioning reflects a reduction of $46 million from the corresponding ARO recorded as of December 31, 2005. The reduction is primarily related to the expectation of lower decommissioning cost escalations than had been assumed in the prior cash flow analysis. All of the amounts recorded in connection with SFAS 143 and FIN 47 are based upon estimates which are subject to varying degrees of imprecision, particularly since such payments will be made many years in the future. Changes in these estimates will be recorded over time; however, these changes in estimates are not expected to materially impact results of operations so long as the regulatory framework for the Companys utilities remains in place. OTHER MATTERS Off Balance Sheet Financing SCE&G does not hold investments in unconsolidated special purpose entities such as those described in SFAS 140, Accounting for Transfers and Servicing of Financial Assets and Extinguishments of Liabilities, or as described in FIN 46(R), Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities. SCE&G does not engage in off balance sheet financing or similar transactions, although it is party to incidental operating leases in the normal course of business, generally for office space, furniture and equipment. Claims and Litigation For a description of claims and litigation see Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All financial instruments held by SCE&G described below are held for purposes other than trading. The tables below summarize long term debt issued by SCE&G which is sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. Fair values for debt represent quoted market prices. Expected Maturity Date December 31, 2006 Millions of dollars 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 Thereafter Total Fair Value Long Term Debt: Fixed Rate ($) 3.7 3.7 103.7 10.4 164.9 1,667.9 1,954.3 2,001.2 Average Interest Rate (%) 7.78 7.78 6.18 6.31 6.70 5.83 5.93 Expected Maturity Date December 31, 2005 Millions of dollars 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 Thereafter Total Fair Value Long Term Debt: Fixed Rate ($) 169.9 39.2 39.2 139.2 39.2 1,714.4 2,141.1 2,051.3 Average Interest Rate (%) 8.51 6.86 6.86 6.33 6.86 5.88 6.17 While a decrease in interest rates would increase the fair value of debt, it is unlikely that events which would result in a realized loss will occur.
