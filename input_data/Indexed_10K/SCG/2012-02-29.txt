ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW SCANA, through its wholly owned regulated subsidiaries, is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in parts of South Carolina and in the purchase, transmission and sale of natural gas in portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. Through a wholly owned nonregulated subsidiary, SCANA markets natural gas to retail customers in Georgia and to wholesale customers primarily in the southeast. Other wholly owned nonregulated subsidiaries provide fiber optic and other telecommunications services and provide service contracts to homeowners on certain home appliances and heating and air conditioning units. A service company subsidiary of SCANA provides administrative, management and other services to SCANA and its subsidiaries. The following map indicates areas where the Companys significant business segments conduct their activities, as further described in this overview section. The following percentages reflect revenues and income available to common shareholders earned by the Companys regulated and nonregulated businesses and the percentage of total assets held by them. 2011 2010 2009 % of Revenues Regulated 74 % 73 % 73 % Nonregulated 26 % 27 % 27 % % of Income Available to Common Shareholders Regulated 97 % 96 % 96 % Nonregulated 3 % 4 % 4 % % of Assets Regulated 94 % 95 % 94 % Nonregulated 6 % 5 % 6 % 30 Table of Contents Key Earnings Drivers and Outlook During 2011, economic growth showed modest signs of improvement in the southeast. Significant industrial announcements were made in the Companys South Carolina service territory during the year. In addition, residential and commercial customer growth rates in the Companys regulated businesses were positive, though customer usage by existing customers continued to decline. Unemployment rates for the states in which the Company primarily provides service also showed some improvement, though unemployment remains high and continues to slow the pace of economic recovery in the Southeast. Unemployment (seasonally adjusted) United States Georgia North Carolina South Carolina December 31, 2011 (preliminary) 8.5 % 9.7 % 9.9 % 9.5 % December 31, 2010 9.4 % 10.4 % 9.8 % 10.9 % Over the next five years, key earnings drivers for the Company will be additions to rate base at its regulated subsidiaries, consisting primarily of capital expenditures for new generating capacity, environmental facilities and system expansion. Other factors that will impact future earnings growth include the regulatory environment, customer growth and usage in each of the regulated utility businesses, earnings in the natural gas marketing business in Georgia and the level of growth of operation and maintenance expenses and taxes. Electric Operations The electric operations segment is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, GENCO and Fuel Company, and is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in South Carolina. At December 31, 2011, SCE&G provided electricity to approximately 664,000 customers in an area covering nearly 17,000 square miles. GENCO owns a coal fired generating station and sells electricity solely to SCE&G. Fuel Company acquires, owns and provides financing for SCE&Gs nuclear fuel, certain fossil fuels and emission allowances. Operating results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for electricity, rates allowed to be charged to customers and the ability to control growth in costs. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity. SCE&Gs allowed return on equity is 10.7% for non BLRA expenditures, and 11.0% for BLRA related expenditures. Demand for electricity is primarily affected by weather, customer growth and the economy. SCE&G is able to recover the cost of fuel used in electric generation through retail customers bills, but increases in fuel costs affect electric prices and, therefore, the competitive position of electricity against other energy sources. New Nuclear Construction SCE&G and Santee Cooper are parties to construction and operating agreements in which they agreed to be joint owners, and share operating costs and generation output, of two 1,117 MW nuclear generation units to be constructed at the site of Summer Station, with SCE&G responsible for 55 percent of the cost and receiving 55 percent of the output, and Santee Cooper responsible for and receiving the remaining 45 percent. Under these agreements, SCE&G will have the primary responsibility for oversight of the construction of the New Units and will be responsible for the operation of the New Units as they come online. SCE&G, on behalf of itself and as agent for Santee Cooper, has entered into the EPC Contract with the Consortium for the design and construction of the New Units. SCE&Gs share of the estimated cash outlays (future value, excluding AFC) totals approximately $6 billion for plant costs and related transmission infrastructure costs, which costs are projected based on historical one year and five year escalation rates as required by the SCPSC. The successful completion of the New Units would result in a substantial increase in the Companys utility plant in service. Financing and managing the construction of these plants, together with continuing environmental construction projects, represents a significant challenge to the Company. As previously reported, SCE&G has been advised by Santee Cooper that it is reviewing certain aspects of its capital improvement program and long term power supply plan, including the level of its participation in the New Units. Santee Cooper has entered into a letter of intent with Duke that may result in Duke acquiring a portion of Santee Coopers ownership interest in the New Units. The Consortium has recently performed an impact study, at SCE&Gs request, related to various cost and timing alternatives arising from the delay in the issuance date of the COL from mid 2011, which was the date assumed when the EPC Contract was signed in 2008, to the early 2012 issuance date currently anticipated by SCE&G. SCE&G has recently 31 Table of Contents informed the Consortium that it intends to pursue the alternative that would delay the substantial completion date of the first New Unit and accelerate the substantial completion date for the second New Unit and has also begun discussions concerning the update of cash flow forecasts and construction schedules on that basis. In December 2011, the NRC granted final design certification to Westinghouse for the AP1000 nuclear reactor, which is the reactor to be used for the New Units. This certification is a necessary step before the NRC can issue a COL for the New Units. In October 2011, the NRC conducted a mandatory hearing regarding the issuance of a COL for the New Units. This hearing followed the August 2011 completion of the FSER, in which the NRC staff concluded there were no safety aspects that would preclude issuing the COL, and the April 2011 completion of the FEIS, in which the NRC and the USACE concluded there were no environmental impacts that would preclude issuing the COL. See additional discussion at OTHER MATTERS Nuclear Generation. Environmental Significant federal legislative initiatives related to energy were unsuccessful in 2011, and the Company expects such legislative initiatives will be hampered through 2012, due to each chamber of Congress being controlled by different political parties. The EPA, however, did issue new rules in 2011 related to air quality, including CSAPR and MATS, which require reductions in power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury, among other substances. Though implementation of CSAPR was stayed by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia pending judicial review, the Company cannot predict the outcome that judicial review will have on the rules implementation. In 2012, additional significant regulatory initiatives by the EPA and other federal agencies will likely proceed. These initiatives may require the Company to build or otherwise acquire generating capacity from energy sources that exclude fossil fuels, nuclear or hydro facilities (for example, under an RES). It is also possible that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. The Company cannot predict whether such initiatives will be enacted, and if they are, the conditions they would impose on utilities. The EPA has stated its intention to propose, in late 2012, new federal regulations affecting the management and disposal of CCR, such as ash. Such regulations could result in the treatment of some CCRs as hazardous waste and could impose significant costs to utilities, such as SCE&G and GENCO. The EPA is also expected to issue regulations during 2012 for cooling water intake structures to meet BACT at existing power generating stations. While the Company cannot predict how extensive the regulations will be, the Company believes that any additional costs imposed by such regulations would be recoverable through rates. Gas Distribution The gas distribution segment, comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G and PSNC Energy, is primarily engaged in the purchase, transportation and sale of natural gas to retail customers in portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. At December 31, 2011 this segment provided natural gas to approximately 804,000 customers in areas covering 34,600 square miles. Operating results for gas distribution are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas rates allowed to be charged to customers and the ability to control growth in costs. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity. Demand for natural gas is primarily affected by weather, customer growth, the economy and, for commercial and industrial customers, the availability and price of alternate fuels. Natural gas competes with electricity, propane and heating oil to serve the heating and, to a lesser extent, other household energy needs of residential and small commercial customers. This competition is generally based on price and convenience. Large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel, such as propane or fuel oil. Natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price. As a result, any significant disparity between supply and demand, either of natural gas or of alternate fuels, and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors, will affect price and impact the Companys ability to retain large commercial and industrial customers. One effect of the sluggish economy has been an overall decrease in demand for natural gas which, coupled with discoveries of shale gas in the United States, resulted in significantly lower prices for this commodity in 2010 and 2011. Low natural gas commodity prices are expected to continue in 2012 and beyond. 32 Table of Contents Retail Gas Marketing SCANA Energy, a division of SEMI, comprises the retail gas marketing segment. This segment markets natural gas to approximately 455,000 customers throughout Georgia (as of December 31, 2011, and includes approximately 80,000 customers in its regulated division described below). SCANA Energys total customer base represents an approximate 30% share of the customers in Georgias deregulated natural gas market. SCANA Energy remains the second largest natural gas marketer in the state. SCANA Energys competitors include an affiliate of a large energy company with experience in Georgias energy market, as well as several electric membership cooperatives. SCANA Energys ability to maintain its market share depends on the prices it charges customers relative to the prices charged by its competitors, its ability to continue to provide high levels of customer service and other factors. As Georgias regulated provider, SCANA Energy provides service to low income customers and customers unable to obtain or maintain natural gas service from other marketers at rates approved by the GPSC. SCANA Energy receives funding from the Universal Service Fund to offset some of the bad debt associated with the low income group. SCANA Energys contract to serve as Georgias regulated provider of natural gas has been renewed by the GPSC through August 31, 2014. SCANA Energy files financial and other information periodically with the GPSC, and such information is available at www.psc.state.ga.us (which is not intended as an active hyperlink; the information on the GPSC website is not part of this or any other report filed with the SEC). SCANA Energy and SCANAs other natural gas distribution and marketing segments maintain gas inventory and also utilize forward contracts and other financial instruments, including commodity swaps and futures contracts, to manage their exposure to fluctuating commodity natural gas prices. See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. As a part of this risk management process, at any given time, a portion of SCANAs projected natural gas needs has been purchased or otherwise placed under contract. Since SCANA Energy operates in a competitive market, it may be unable to sustain its current levels of customers and or pricing, thereby reducing expected margins and profitability. Further, there can be no assurance that Georgias gas delivery regulatory framework will remain unchanged as dynamic market conditions evolve. Energy Marketing The divisions of SEMI excluding SCANA Energy comprise the energy marketing segment. This segment markets natural gas primarily in the southeast and provides energy related risk management services to customers. The operating results for energy marketing are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas and the ability to control growth of costs. Demand for natural gas is primarily affected by the price of alternate fuels and customer growth. In addition, certain pipeline capacity available for Energy Marketing to serve industrial and other customers is dependent upon the market share held by SCANA Energy in the retail market. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS 2011 2010 2009 Basic earnings per share $ 3.01 $ 2.99 $ 2.85 Diluted earnings per share $ 2.97 $ 2.98 $ 2.85 Cash dividends declared (per share) $ 1.94 $ 1.90 $ 1.88 2011 vs 2010 Basic earnings per share increased in 2011 due to higher electric margin of $.42 and lower operating expenses of $.06. These increases were partially offset by lower gas margin of $.13, higher depreciation expense of $.06, higher property taxes of $.06, dilution from additional shares outstanding of $.07 and higher interest expense of $.14. 2010 vs 2009 Basic earnings per share increased in 2010 due to higher electric margin (excluding the effect of the $17.4 million adjustment described at Electric Operations) of $.60 and higher gas margin of $.15. These increases were partially offset by dilution from additional shares outstanding of $.09, higher operating expense of $.32, higher interest expense of $.09, net of preferred stock dividends, and $.11 due to the tax benefit and related interest income arising from the resolution of an income tax uncertainty in favor of the Company in 2009. In late 2009 SCE&G redeemed for cash all outstanding shares of its cumulative preferred stock. Diluted Earnings Per Share In May 2010, SCANA entered into equity forward contracts for approximately 6.6 million common shares. During periods when the average market price of SCANAs common stock is above the per share adjusted forward sales price, the 33 Table of Contents Company computes diluted earnings per share giving effect to this dilutive potential common stock utilizing the treasury stock method. Pension Cost Pension cost was recorded on the Companys income statements and balance sheets as follows: Millions of dollars 2011 2010 2009 Income Statement Impact: Increase in employee benefit costs $ 2.6 $ 1.1 Other expense (income) 0.5 (3.9 ) $ (3.7 ) Balance Sheet Impact: Increase in capital expenditures 3.9 6.0 9.8 Component of amount receivable from Summer Station co owner 1.2 1.7 2.7 Increase in regulatory asset 9.1 18.6 31.2 Total Pension Cost $ 17.3 $ 23.5 $ 40.0 Prior to July 15, 2010, the SCPSC allowed SCE&G to defer as a regulatory asset the amount of pension cost exceeding amounts included in rates for its retail electric and gas distribution regulated operations. In connection with the SCPSCs July 2010 electric rate order and November 2010 natural gas RSA order, SCE&G began deferring, as a regulatory asset, all pension cost related to retail electric and gas operations that otherwise would have been charged to expense. These costs will be deferred until such time as future rate recovery is provided for by the SCPSC. No contribution to the pension trust was necessary, nor did limitations on benefit payments apply, in or for any period reported. AFC AFC is a utility accounting practice whereby a portion of the cost of both equity and borrowed funds used to finance construction (which is shown on the balance sheet as construction work in progress) is capitalized. The Company includes an equity portion of AFC in nonoperating income and a debt portion of AFC in interest charges (credits) as noncash items, both of which have the effect of increasing reported net income. AFC represented approximately 3.9% of income before income taxes in 2011, 5.6% in 2010 and 9.8% in 2009. Electric Operations Electric Operations is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, GENCO and Fuel Company. Electric operations sales margin (including transactions with affiliates) was as follows: Millions of dollars 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Operating revenues $ 2,432.2 2.5 % $ 2,373.9 10.5 % $ 2,148.9 Less: Fuel used in generation 922.5 (2.6 )% 946.7 15.1 % 822.3 Purchased power 19.2 12.9 % 17.0 1.2 % 16.8 Margin $ 1,490.5 5.7 % $ 1,410.2 7.7 % $ 1,309.8 2011 vs 2010 Margin increased by $49.0 million due to an increase in retail electric base rates approved by the SCPSC under the BLRA and by $34.5 million due to an SCPSC approved increase in retail electric base rates in July 2010. Also, margin in the first quarter of 2010 was adjusted downward by $17.4 million pursuant to an SCPSC regulatory order in connection with SCE&Gs annual fuel cost proceeding. These increases were partially offset by $12 million due to the effects of weather in 2010 before the implementation of the SCPSC approved eWNA and by lower customer usage of $8.7 million. 34 Table of Contents 2010 vs 2009 Margin increased by $37.0 million due to higher SCPSC approved retail electric base rates in July 2010 and by $30.7 million due to an increase in base rates approved by the SCPSC under the BLRA. In addition, margin increased by $54.2 million (net of eWNA after its implementation) due to weather, by $5.8 million due to higher transmission revenue and off system sales and by $13.6 million due to the adoption of SCPSC approved lower electric depreciation rates in 2009, the effect of which was offset by a reduction in the recovery of fuel costs (electric revenue). During the first quarter of 2010, the Company deferred $25 million of incremental revenue as a result of the abnormally cold weather in SCE&Gs service territory (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). Also, margin in the first quarter of 2010 was adjusted downward by $17.4 million pursuant to an SCPSC regulatory order issued in connection with SCE&Gs annual fuel cost proceeding. (See also discussion at Income Taxes.) Finally, pursuant to the SCPSC approved retail electric base rate order in 2010, SCE&G adopted an eWNA thereby mitigating the effects of abnormal weather on its margins. Sales volumes (in GWh) related to the electric margin above, by class, were as follows: Classification 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Residential 8,232 (6.4 )% 8,791 11.4 % 7,893 Commercial 7,397 (3.7 )% 7,684 4.5 % 7,350 Industrial 5,938 1.3 % 5,863 10.1 % 5,324 Other 572 (1.5 )% 581 3.4 % 562 Total retail sales 22,139 (3.4 )% 22,919 8.5 % 21,129 Wholesale 2,049 4.3 % 1,965 (0.5 )% 1,975 Total Sales 24,188 (2.8 )% 24,884 7.7 % 23,104 2011 vs 2010 Total retail sales volumes decreased by 775 GWh due to weather. 2010 vs 2009 Total retail sales volumes increased by 1,209 GWh due to weather and by 539 GWh due to higher industrial sales volumes. Gas Distribution Gas Distribution is comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G and PSNC Energy. Gas Distribution sales margin (including transactions with affiliates) was as follows: Millions of dollars 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Operating revenues $ 840.4 (14.2 )% $ 979.4 3.3 % $ 948.4 Less: Gas purchased for resale 466.3 (22.5 )% 601.7 2.8 % 585.1 Margin $ 374.1 (1.0 )% $ 377.7 4.0 % $ 363.3 2011 vs 2010 Margin at SCE&G decreased by $8.2 million due to the SCPSC approved decrease in retail gas base rates which became effective with the first billing cycle of November 2010. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $1.8 million due to the SCPSC approved increase in retail gas base rates which became effective with the first billing cycle of November 2011. Margin at PSNC Energy increased $2.9 million due to residential and commercial customer growth. 2010 vs 2009 Margin at SCE&G increased by $9.2 million due to the SCPSC approved increase in retail gas base rates which became effective with the first billing cycle of November 2009 and $3.3 million due to increased customer usage. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.2 million due to an SCPSC approved decrease in retail gas base rates which became effective with the first billing cycle of November 2010. Margin at PSNC Energy increased by $4.0 million primarily due to residential customer growth and improved industrial usage. 35 Table of Contents Sales volumes (in DT) by class, including transportation gas, were as follows: Classification (in thousands) 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Residential 36,568 (19.2 )% 45,251 16.0 % 38,995 Commercial 25,772 (11.0 )% 28,972 6.4 % 27,220 Industrial 18,782 (0.4 )% 18,860 12.3 % 16,798 Transportation gas 34,152 3.2 % 33,089 7.3 % 30,845 Total 115,274 (8.6 )% 126,172 10.8 % 113,858 2011 vs 2010 Residential, commercial and industrial sales volume decreased primarily due to milder weather. Transportation sales volume increased primarily as a result of improved economic conditions and the competitive price of gas versus alternate fuel sources. 2010 vs 2009 Residential sales volume increased primarily due to customer growth and weather. Commercial and industrial sales volume increased primarily as a result of improved economic conditions. Retail Gas Marketing Retail Gas Marketing is comprised of SCANA Energy which operates in Georgias natural gas market. Retail Gas Marketing revenues and income available to common shareholders were as follows: Millions of dollars 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Operating revenues $ 478.8 (13.4 )% $ 552.9 6.0 % $ 521.7 Income available to common shareholders $ 24.2 (20.7 )% $ 30.5 27.1 % $ 24.0 2011 vs 2010 Operating revenues decreased as a result of milder weather and lower consumption. Income available to common shareholders decreased due to lower margins, partially offset by lower bad debt and operating expenses. 2010 vs 2009 Operating revenues increased as a result of colder than normal weather and higher consumption. Income available to common shareholders increased due to higher margins, partially offset by higher bad debt and operating expenses. Energy Marketing Energy Marketing is comprised of the Companys nonregulated marketing operations, excluding SCANA Energy. Energy Marketing operating revenues and income available to common shareholders were as follows: Millions of dollars 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Operating revenues $ 844.9 (3.3 )% $ 874.1 12.5 % $ 776.9 Income available to common shareholders $ 4.4 12.8 % $ 3.9 14.7 % $ 3.4 2011 vs 2010 Operating revenues decreased due to lower market prices. Income available to common shareholders increased due to lower operating expenses, including bad debt. 2010 vs 2009 Operating revenues increased due to higher sales volume. Income available to common shareholders increased due to lower operating expenses, partially offset by higher bad debt expense. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses were as follows: Millions of dollars 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Other operation and maintenance $ 657.9 (1.8 )% $ 669.9 4.7 % $ 639.7 Depreciation and amortization 346.3 3.3 % 335.1 6.0 % 316.0 Other taxes 200.8 5.5 % 190.4 7.6 % 176.9 36 Table of Contents 2011 vs 2010 Other operation and maintenance expenses decreased by $7.8 million due to lower customer service expenses, including bad debt expense, and by $4.1 million due to lower incentive compensation and other benefits. These decreases were partially offset by $0.8 million due to higher generation, transmission and distribution expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to net property additions. Other taxes increased primarily due to higher property taxes. 2010 vs 2009 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased by $17.7 million due to higher generation, transmission and distribution expenses, by $10.9 million due to higher incentive compensation and other benefits and by $6.1 million due to higher customer service expenses and general expenses, including bad debt expense. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to net property additions. Other taxes increased primarily due to higher property taxes. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) includes the results of certain incidental (non utility) activities and the activities of certain non regulated subsidiaries. Components of other income (expense) were as follows: Millions of dollars 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Other income $ 52.2 (0.9 )% $ 52.7 (21.0 )% $ 66.7 Other expense (40.0 ) 1.3 % (39.5 ) 7.0 % (36.9 ) Total $ 12.2 (7.6 )% $ 13.2 (55.7 )% $ 29.8 2011 vs 2010 Changes in other income (expense) were not significant. 2010 vs 2009 Total other income (expense) decreased $13.4 million due to decreased interest income. In September 2009, as a result of a favorable decision by the South Carolina Supreme Court, SCE&G was refunded previously contested EIZ Credits of $15.3 million and an additional $14.3 million of interest income. SCE&G recorded a multi year catch up adjustment in the third quarter of 2009 of approximately $6.3 million ($4.0 million after federal tax effect) as a reduction in income taxes. The interest income of $14.3 million ($8.8 million after tax effect) was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 within other income. Interest Expense Components of interest expense, net of the debt component of AFC, were as follows: Millions of dollars 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Interest on long term debt, net $ 276.6 5.9 % $ 261.1 14.3 % $ 228.5 Other interest expense 7.7 71.1 % 4.5 (10.0 )% 5.0 Total $ 284.3 7.0 % $ 265.6 13.7 % $ 233.5 Interest on long term debt increased in each year primarily due to increased long term borrowings over the prior year. Other interest expense increased in 2011, and decreased in 2010, primarily due to corresponding changes in principal balances outstanding on short term debt over the respective prior year. Income Taxes Income tax expense (and the effective tax rate) increased in 2011 over 2010 primarily due to the accelerated amortization of deferred EIZ Credits to offset undercollected fuel costs in 2010 pursuant to an SCPSC order and an increase in operating income. Income tax expense (and the effective tax rate) decreased in 2010 over 2009 primarily due to the above mentioned accelerated amortization of EIZ Credits to offset undercollected fuel costs and the accelerated amortization of EIZ Credits in connection with the July 2010 retail electric rate order. (See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for reconciling differences between income tax expense and statutory tax expense.) 37 Table of Contents LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The Company anticipates that its contractual cash obligations will be met through internally generated funds, the incurrence of additional short and long term indebtedness and sales of equity securities. The Company expects that it has or can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet its projected cash requirements for the foreseeable future. The Companys ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 2.87. Cash requirements for SCANAs regulated subsidiaries arise primarily from their operational needs, funding their construction programs and payment of dividends to SCANA. The ability of the regulated subsidiaries to replace existing plant investment, to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas and to install equipment necessary to comply with environmental regulations, will depend on their ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms. Regulated subsidiaries recover the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers. Rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs. As customer growth and inflation occur and these subsidiaries continue their ongoing construction programs, rate increases will be sought. The future financial position and results of operations of the regulated subsidiaries will be affected by their ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief. The Company also obtains equity from SCANAs stock plans. Shares of SCANA common stock are acquired on behalf of participants in SCANAs Investor Plus Plan and Stock Purchase Savings Plan through the original issuance of shares, rather than being purchased on the open market. This provided approximately $97 million of additional equity during 2011 and is expected to provide approximately $102 million of additional capital in 2012. Due primarily to new nuclear construction plans, the Company anticipates keeping this strategy in place for the foreseeable future. The Company also expects to issue common stock in 2012 under forward contracts executed in 2010 (and extended by amendment in October 2011). SCANAs leverage ratio of long and short term debt to capital was approximately 58% at December 31, 2011. SCANA has publicly announced its desire to maintain its leverage ratio at levels between 54% and 57%, but SCANAs ability to achieve and maintain those levels depends on a number of factors. In the future, if SCANA is not able to achieve and maintain its leverage ratio within the desired range, the Companys debt ratings may be affected, it may be required to pay higher interest rates on its long and short term indebtedness, and its access to the capital markets may be limited. Capital Expenditures Cash outlays for property additions and construction expenditures, including nuclear fuel, net of AFC, were $884 million in 2011 and are estimated to be $1.4 billion in 2012. The Companys current estimates of its capital expenditures for construction and nuclear fuel for 2012 2014, which are subject to continuing review and adjustment, are as follows: Estimated Capital Expenditures Millions of dollars 2012 2013 2014 SCE&G Normal Generation $ 143 $ 96 $ 79 Transmission & Distribution 197 217 190 Other 26 14 21 Gas 49 51 57 Common 14 18 13 Total SCE&G Normal 429 396 360 PSNC Energy 57 65 70 Other 54 41 32 Total Normal 540 502 462 New Nuclear 954 952 727 Cash Requirements for Construction 1,494 1,454 1,189 Nuclear Fuel 44 110 55 Total Estimated Capital Expenditures $ 1,538 $ 1,564 $ 1,244 38 Table of Contents The Companys contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2011 are summarized as follows: Contractual Cash Obligations Payments due by periods Millions of dollars Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years More than 5 years Long and short term debt, including interest $ 10,477 $ 1,216 $ 1,031 $ 547 $ 7,683 Capital leases 13 4 6 3 Operating leases 56 11 16 1 28 Purchase obligations 4,367 984 2,307 412 664 Other commercial commitments 4,724 1,062 1,587 912 1,163 Total $ 19,637 $ 3,277 $ 4,947 $ 1,875 $ 9,538 Included in the table above in purchase obligations is SCE&Gs portion of a contractual agreement for the design and construction of the New Units at the Summer Station site. SCE&G expects to be a joint owner and share operating costs and generation output of the New Units, with SCE&G accounting for 55 percent of the cost and output and the other joint owner(s) the remaining 45 percent. SCE&Gs estimated projected costs for the two additional units, in future dollars and excluding AFC, are summarized below. To the extent that actual contracts were put in place by December 31, 2011, obligations arising from these contracts are included in the purchase obligations within the Contractual Cash Obligations table above. Future Value Millions of dollars 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After 2016 Total Project Cash Outlay $ 804 $ 825 $ 558 $ 575 $ 367 $ 232 Also included in purchase obligations are customary purchase orders under which the Company has the option to utilize certain vendors without the obligation to do so. The Company may terminate such arrangements without penalty. Other commercial commitments includes estimated obligations under forward contracts for natural gas purchases. Forward contracts for natural gas purchases include customary make whole or default provisions, but are not considered to be take or pay contracts. Certain of these contracts relate to regulated businesses; therefore, the effects of such contracts on fuel costs are reflected in electric or gas rates. Other commercial commitments also includes a take and pay contract for natural gas which expires in 2019 and estimated obligations for coal and nuclear fuel purchases. In addition to the contractual cash obligations above, the Company sponsors a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan and an unfunded health care and life insurance benefit plan for retirees. The pension plan is adequately funded under current regulations, and no significant contributions are anticipated until after 2012. Cash payments under the health care and life insurance benefit plan were $12.2 million in 2011, and such annual payments are expected to be the same or increase up to $14.0 million in the future. In addition, the Company is party to certain NYMEX futures contracts for which any unfavorable market movements are funded in cash. These derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges and their effects are reflected within other comprehensive income until the anticipated sales transactions occur. See further discussion at Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. At December 31, 2011, the Company had posted $15.4 million in cash collateral for such contracts. In addition, the Company had posted $125 million in cash collateral for interest rate derivative contracts. The Company also has a legal obligation associated with the decommissioning and dismantling of Summer Station Unit 1 and other conditional asset retirement obligations that are not listed in the contractual cash obligations table. See Notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements. Financing Limits and Related Matters The Companys issuance of various securities, including long term and short term debt, is subject to customary approval or authorization by regulatory bodies including state public service commissions and FERC. Financing programs currently utilized by the Company follow. 39 Table of Contents SCE&G and GENCO have obtained FERC authority to issue short term indebtedness (pursuant to Section 204 of the Federal Power Act). SCE&G may issue up to $1.2 billion of unsecured promissory notes or commercial paper with maturity dates of one year or less, and GENCO may issue up to $150 million of short term indebtedness. The authority to make such issuances will expire in October 2012. SCANA, SCE&G (including Fuel Company) and PSNC Energy are parties to five year credit agreements in the amounts of $300 million, $1.1 billion, of which $400 million relates to Fuel Company, and $100 million, respectively, which expire October 23, 2015. These credit agreements are used for general corporate purposes, including liquidity support for each companys commercial paper program and working capital needs and, in the case of Fuel Company, to finance or refinance the purchase of nuclear fuel, certain fossil fuels, and emission and other environmental allowances. These committed long term facilities are revolving lines of credit under credit agreements with a syndicate of banks. Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Bank of America, N. A. and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. each provide 10% of the aggregate $1.5 billion credit facilities, Branch Banking and Trust Company, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., TD Bank N.A. and UBS Loan Finance LLC each provide 8%, and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Union Bank, N.A. and U.S. Bank National Association each provide 5.3%. Three other banks provide the remaining 6%. These bank credit facilities support the issuance of commercial paper by SCANA, SCE&G (including Fuel Company) and PSNC Energy. When the commercial paper markets are dislocated (due to either price or availability constraints), the credit facilities are available to support the borrowing needs of SCANA, SCE&G (including Fuel Company) and PSNC Energy. At December 31, 2011 and 2010, SCANA, SCE&G (including Fuel Company) and PSNC Energy had available the following committed LOC and had outstanding the following LOC advances, commercial paper, and LOC supported letter of credit obligations: SCANA SCE&G PSNC Energy Millions of dollars 2011 2010 2011 2010 2011 2010 Lines of Credit: Committed long term Total $ 300 $ 300 $ 1,100 $ 1,100 $ 100 $ 100 LOC advances Weighted average interest rate Outstanding commercial paper (270 or fewer days) $ 131 $ 39 $ 512 $ 381 $ 10 $ Weighted average interest rate .63 % .35 % .56 % .42 % .57 % Letters of credit supported by LOC $ 3 $ 3 $ .3 $ .3 $ Available $ 166 $ 258 $ 588 $ 719 $ 90 $ 100 As of December 31, 2011, the Company had no outstanding borrowings under its $1.5 billion credit facilities, had approximately $653 million in commercial paper borrowings outstanding, was obligated under $3.3 million in LOC supported letters of credit, and held approximately $29 million in cash and temporary investments. The Company regularly monitors the commercial paper and short term credit markets to optimize the timing for repayment of the outstanding balance on its draws, while maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity. Average short term borrowings outstanding during 2011 were approximately $573 million. Short term cash needs were met primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. At December 31, 2011, the Company had net available liquidity of approximately $873 million. The Company regularly monitors the commercial paper and short term credit markets to optimize the timing of replacement of any outstanding balance on its draws from the credit facilities, while maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity. The Companys long term debt portfolio has a weighted average maturity of almost 17 years and bears an average cost of 6.14%. A significant portion of long term debt bears fixed interest rates or is swapped to fixed. To further preserve liquidity, the Company rigorously reviews its projected capital expenditures and operating costs and adjusts them where possible without impacting safety, reliability, and core customer service. The Companys articles of incorporation do not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock. However, SCANAs junior subordinated indenture (relating to the hereinafter defined Hybrids), SCE&Gs bond indenture (relating to the hereinafter defined Bonds) and PSNC Energys note purchase and debenture purchase agreements each contain provisions that, under certain circumstances, which the Company considers to be remote, could limit the payment of cash dividends on their respective common stock. 40 Table of Contents With respect to hydroelectric projects, the Federal Power Act requires the appropriation of a portion of certain earnings therefrom. At December 31, 2011, approximately $58.8 million of retained earnings were restricted by this requirement as to payment of cash dividends on SCE&Gs common stock. SCANA Corporation SCANA has in effect an indenture which permits the issuance of unsecured debt securities from time to time including its medium term notes. This indenture contains no specific limit on the amount of unsecured debt securities which may be issued. SCANA has outstanding $150 million of enhanced junior subordinated notes (Hybrids) bearing an interest rate of 7.70% and maturing on January 30, 2065, subject to extension to January 30, 2080. Because their structure and terms are characteristic of both debt instruments and equity securities, the rating agencies consider securities like the Hybrids to be hybrid debt instruments and give some equity credit to the issuers of such securities for purposes of computing leverage ratios of debt to capital. The Hybrids are only subject to redemption at SCANAs option and may be redeemed at any time, although the redemption prices payable by SCANA differ depending on the timing of the redemption and the circumstances (if any) giving rise thereto. In connection with the Hybrids, SCANA executed an RCC in favor of the holders of certain designated debt (referred to as covered debt). Under the terms of the RCC, SCANA agreed not to redeem or repurchase all or part of the Hybrids prior to the termination date of the RCC, unless it uses the proceeds of certain qualifying securities sold to non affiliates within 180 days prior to the redemption or repurchase date. The proceeds SCANA receives from such qualifying securities, adjusted by a predetermined factor, must exceed the redemption or repurchase price of the Hybrids. Qualifying securities include common stock, and other securities that generally rank equal to or junior to the Hybrids and include distribution, deferral and long dated maturity features similar to the Hybrids. For purposes of the RCC, non affiliates include (but are not limited to) individuals enrolled in SCANAs dividend reinvestment plan, direct stock purchase plan and employee benefit plans. The RCC is scheduled to terminate on the earliest to occur of the following: (a) January 30, 2035 (or later, if the maturity date of the Hybrids is extended), (b) the date on which SCANA no longer has any eligible debt which ranks senior in right of payment to the Hybrids, (c) the date on which the holders of at least a majority in principal amount of covered debt agree to the termination thereof or (d) the date on which the Hybrids are accelerated following an event of default with respect thereto. SCANAs $250 million in Medium Term Notes due April 1, 2020 were initially designated as covered debt under the RCC. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company SCE&G is subject to a bond indenture dated April 1, 1993 (Mortgage) covering substantially all of its electric properties under which all of its first mortgage bonds (Bonds) have been issued. Bonds may be issued under the Mortgage in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the sum of (1) 70% of Unfunded Net Property Additions (as therein defined), (2) the aggregate principal amount of retired Bonds and (3) cash deposited with the trustee. Bonds, other than certain Bonds issued on the basis of retired Bonds, may be issued under the Mortgage only if Adjusted Net Earnings (as therein defined) for 12 consecutive months out of the 18 months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least twice (2.0) the annual interest requirements on all outstanding Bonds and Bonds to be outstanding (Bond Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Bond Ratio was 5.37. Financing Activities In January 2012, SCANA issued $250 million of 4.125% medium term notes due February 1, 2022. Proceeds from the sale were used by SCANA to retire $250 million of its 6.25% medium term notes due February 1, 2012. The borrowings refinanced by this 2012 issuance are classified within Long term Debt, Net in the consolidated balance sheet. In January 2012, SCE&G issued $250 million of 4.35% first mortgage bonds due February 1, 2042. Proceeds from the sale were used to repay short term debt primarily incurred as a result of our construction program, to finance capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. In October 2011, SCE&G issued $30 million of 3.22% first mortgage bonds due October 18, 2021. Proceeds from the sale of these bonds were used to redeem prior to maturity $30 million of the 5.7% pollution control facilities revenue bonds due November 1, 2024 issued by Orangeburg County, South Carolina, on SCE&Gs behalf. 41 Table of Contents In May 2011, SCE&G issued $100 million of 5.45% first mortgage bonds due February 1, 2041, which constituted a reopening of the prior offering of $250 million of 5.45% first mortgage bonds issued in January 2011. Proceeds from these sales were used to retire $150 million of SCE&G first mortgage bonds due February 1, 2011, to repay short term debt primarily incurred as a result of SCE&Gs construction program, to finance other capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. In May 2011 SCANA issued $300 million of 4.75% medium term notes due May 15, 2021. Proceeds from the sale of these notes were used by SCANA to retire $300 million of its 6.875% medium term notes. In February 2011, PSNC Energy issued $150 million of 4.59% unsecured senior notes due February 14, 2021. Proceeds from these notes were used to retire PSNC Energys $150 million medium term notes due February 15, 2011. SCANA issued common stock valued at $59.2 million (at time of issue) in a public offering on May 17, 2010 and entered into forward agreements for the sale of approximately 6.6 million shares. The forward agreements, after being extended by amendment dated October 26, 2011, are to be settled no later than December 31, 2012. In March 2010, PSNC Energy issued $100 million of 6.54% unsecured notes due March 30, 2020. Proceeds from the sale were used to pay down short term debt and for general corporate purposes. During 2011 the Company experienced net cash inflows related to financing activities of approximately $240 million primarily due to issuances of common stock and short term and long term debt, partially offset by repayment of long term debt and payment of dividends. The Company paid approximately $61 million in 2011 to settle interest rate contracts associated with the issuance of long term debt. For additional information on significant financing activities, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. In February 2012, SCANA increased the quarterly cash dividend rate on SCANA common stock to $.495 per share, an increase of 2.1% from the prior declared dividend. The dividend is payable April 1, 2012 to shareholders of record on March 9, 2012. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS The Companys regulated operations are subject to extensive regulation by various federal and state authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes. Applicable statutes and rules include the CAA, CWA, Nuclear Waste Act and CERCLA, among others. Compliance with these environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs, which the Company expects to recover through existing ratemaking provisions. For the three years ended December 31, 2011, the Companys capital expenditures for environmental control equipment at its fossil fuel generating stations totaled $164.0 million. In addition, the Company made expenditures to operate and maintain environmental control equipment at its fossil plants of $7.9 million during 2011, $6.5 million during 2010, and $5.6 million during 2009, which are included in Other operation and maintenance expense and made expenditures to handle waste ash of $8.7 million in 2011, $5.9 million in 2010, and $6.5 million in 2009, which are included in Fuel used in electric generation. In addition, included within Other operation and maintenance expense is an annual amortization of $1.4 million in each of 2011, 2010, and 2009 related to SCE&Gs recovery of MGP remediation costs as approved by the SCPSC. It is not possible to estimate all future costs related to environmental matters, but forecasts for capitalized environmental expenditures for the Company are $35.0 million for 2012 and $126.1 million for the four year period 2013 2016. These expenditures are included in the Companys Estimated Capital Expenditures table, are discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources, and include known costs related to the matters discussed below. At the state level, no significant environmental legislation that would affect the Companys operations advanced during 2011. The Company cannot predict whether such legislation will be introduced or enacted in 2012, or if new regulations or changes to existing regulations at the state level will be implemented in the coming year. Several regulatory initiatives at the federal level did advance in 2011 and more are expected to advance in 2012 as described below. 42 Table of Contents Air Quality With the pervasive emergence of concern over the issue of global climate change as a significant influence upon the economy, SCANA, SCE&G and GENCO are subject to climate related financial risks, including those involving regulatory requirements responsive to GHG emissions, as well as those involving physical impacts which could arise from global climate change. Other business and financial risks arising from such climate change could also arise. The Company cannot predict all of the climate related regulatory and physical risks nor the related consequences which might impact the Company, and the following discussion should not be considered all inclusive. From a regulatory perspective, SCANA, SCE&G and GENCO continually monitor and evaluate their current and projected emission levels and strive to comply with all state and federal regulations regarding those emissions. SCE&G and GENCO participate in the sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission allowance programs with respect to coal plant emissions and also have constructed additional pollution control equipment at several larger coal fired electric generating plants. Further, SCE&G is engaged in pre construction activities of the New Units which are expected to reduce GHG emission levels significantly once they are completed and dispatched by potentially displacing some of the current coal fired generation sources. In 2005, the EPA issued the CAIR, which required the District of Columbia and 28 states, including South Carolina, to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in order to attain mandated state levels. CAIR set emission limits to be met in two phases beginning in 2009 and 2015, respectively, for nitrogen oxide and beginning in 2010 and 2015, respectively, for sulfur dioxide. SCE&G and GENCO determined that additional air quality controls would be needed to meet the CAIR requirements. On July 6, 2011 the EPA issued the CSAPR. This rule replaced CAIR and the Clean Air Transport Rule proposed in July 2010 and is aimed at addressing power plant emissions that may contribute to air pollution in other states. CSAPR requires states in the eastern United States to reduce power plant emissions, specifically sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. On December 30, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued an order staying CSAPR and reinstating CAIR pending resolution of an appeal of CSAPR. Air quality control installations that SCE&G and GENCO have already completed should assist the Company in complying with the CSAPR and the reinstated CAIR. The Company will continue to pursue strategies to comply with all applicable environmental regulations. Any costs incurred to comply with this rule or other rules issued by the EPA in the future are expected to be recoverable through rates. In June 2010, the EPA issued a final rule for a one hour ambient air quality standard for sulfur dioxide. This new standard may require some of SCE&Gs smaller coal fired units to reduce their sulfur dioxide emissions to a level to be determined by the EPA and or DHEC. The costs incurred to comply with this new standard are expected to be recovered through rates. Physical effects associated with climate changes could include the impact of possible changes in weather patterns, such as storm frequency and intensity, and the resultant potential damage to the Companys electric system, as well as impacts on customers and on the Companys supply chain and many others. Much of the service territory of SCE&G is subject to the damaging effects of Atlantic and Gulf coast hurricanes and also to the damaging impact of winter ice storms. To help mitigate the financial risks arising from these potential occurrences, SCE&G maintains insurance on certain properties and has collected funds from customers for its storm damage reserve (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). As part of its ongoing operations, SCE&G maintains emergency response and storm preparation plans and teams, and applicable personnel participate in ongoing training and related simulations in advance of such storms, all in order to allow the Company to protect its assets and to return its systems to normal reliable operation in a timely fashion following any such event. In December 2009, the EPA issued a final finding that atmospheric concentrations of GHG endanger public health and welfare within the meaning of Section 202(a) of the CAA. The rule, which became effective in January 2010, enables the EPA to regulate GHG emissions under the CAA. The EPA has committed to issue new rules regulating such emissions in 2012. The Company expects that any costs incurred to comply with GHG emission requirements will be recoverable through rates. In 2005, the EPA issued the CAMR which established a mercury emissions cap and trade program for coal fired power plants. Numerous parties challenged the rule and, on February 8, 2008, the United States Circuit Court for the District of Columbia vacated the rule for electric utility steam generating units. In March 2011, the EPA proposed new standards for mercury and other specified air pollutants. The rule, which becomes effective on April 16, 2012, provides up to four years for facilities to meet the standards. The rule is currently being evaluated by the Company. Any costs incurred to comply with this rule or other rules issued by the EPA in the future are expected to be recoverable through rates. 43 Table of Contents The EPA is conducting an enforcement initiative against the utilities industry related to the NSR provisions and the new source performance standards of the CAA. As part of the initiative, many utilities have received requests for information under Section 114 of the CAA. In addition, the DOJ, on behalf of EPA, has taken civil enforcement action against several utilities. The primary basis for these actions is the assertion by EPA that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities at their coal fired power plants constituted major modifications which required the installation of costly BACT. Some of the utilities subject to the actions have reached settlement. To date, SCE&G and GENCO have received and responded to Section 114 requests for information related to Canadys, Wateree and Williams Stations. The current state of continued DOJ civil enforcement is the subject of industry wide speculation, and it cannot be determined whether the Company will be affected by the initiative in the future. The Company believes that any enforcement action relative to its compliance with the CAA would be without merit. The Company further believes that installation of equipment responsive to CAIR previously discussed will mitigate many of the alleged concerns with NSR. Water Quality The CWA provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require treatment for wastewater discharges. Under the CWA, compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program. Discharge permits have been issued and renewed for all of SCE&Gs and GENCOs generating units. Concurrent with renewal of these permits, the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program of monitoring and controlling discharges, has modified the requirements for new cooling water intake structures, and has required strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams. The EPA has said that it will issue a rule by mid 2012 that modifies requirements for existing cooling water intake structures. The Company is conducting studies and is developing or implementing compliance plans for these initiatives. Congress is expected to consider further amendments to the CWA. Such legislation may include limitations to mixing zones and toxicity based standards. These provisions, if passed, could have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Company, SCE&G and GENCO. The Company believes that any additional costs imposed by such regulations would be recoverable through rates. Hazardous and Solid Wastes The EPA has stated its intention to propose, in late 2012, new federal regulations affecting the management and disposal of CCRs, such as ash. Such regulations could result in the treatment of some CCRs as hazardous waste and could impose significant costs to utilities, such as SCE&G and GENCO. While the Company cannot predict how extensive the regulations will be, the Company believes that any additional costs imposed by such regulations would be recoverable through rates. The Nuclear Waste Act required that the United States government accept and permanently dispose of high level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998. The Nuclear Waste Act also imposed on utilities the primary responsibility for storage of their spent nuclear fuel until the repository is available. SCE&G entered into a Standard Contract for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and or High Level Radioactive Waste with the DOE in 1983. As of December 31, 2011, the federal government has not accepted any spent fuel from Summer Station Unit 1 or any other nuclear generating facility, and it remains unclear when the repository may become available. SCE&G has on site spent nuclear fuel storage capability until at least 2017 and expects to be able to expand its storage capacity to accommodate the spent nuclear fuel output for the life of Summer Station Unit 1 through dry cask storage or other technology as it becomes available. The provisions of CERCLA authorize the EPA to require the clean up of hazardous waste sites. In addition, the states of South Carolina and North Carolina have similar laws. The Company maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could require environmental clean up. In addition, regulators from the EPA and other federal or state agencies periodically notify the Company that it may be required to perform or participate in the investigation and remediation of a hazardous waste site. As site assessments are initiated, estimates are made of the amount of expenditures, if any, deemed necessary to investigate and remediate each site. These estimates are refined as additional information becomes available; therefore, actual expenditures may differ significantly from the original estimates. Amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and clean up relate solely to regulated operations. Such amounts are recorded in deferred debits and amortized, with recovery provided through rates. The Company has assessed the following matters: 44 Table of Contents Electric Operations SCE&G has been named, along with 53 others, by the EPA as a PRP at the AER Superfund site located in Augusta, Georgia. The PRPs funded a Remedial Investigation and Risk Assessment which was completed and approved by the EPA and funded a Feasibility Study that was completed in 2010. A clean up cost has been estimated and the PRPs have agreed to an allocation of those costs based primarily on volume and type of material each PRP sent to the site. SCE&Gs allocation did not have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. SCE&G maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate its current and former operations sites that could require environmental clean up. As site assessments are initiated, estimates are made of the amount of expenditures, if any, deemed necessary to investigate and remediate each site. These estimates are refined as additional information becomes available; therefore, actual expenditures could differ significantly from the original estimates. Amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and clean up relate solely to regulated operations. SCE&G defers site assessment and cleanup costs and expects to recover them through rates. Gas Distribution SCE&G is responsible for four decommissioned MGP sites in South Carolina which contain residues of by product chemicals. These sites are in various stages of investigation, remediation and monitoring under work plans approved by DHEC. SCE&G anticipates that major remediation activities at these sites will continue until 2014 and will cost an additional $8.3 million. SCE&G expects to recover any cost arising from the remediation of MGP sites through rates and insurance settlements. At December 31, 2011, deferred amounts, net of amounts previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements, totaled $24.9 million and are included in regulatory assets. PSNC Energy is responsible for environmental clean up at five sites in North Carolina on which MGP residuals are present or suspected. PSNC Energys actual remediation costs for these sites will depend on a number of factors, such as actual site conditions, third party claims and recoveries from other PRPs. PSNC Energy has recorded a liability and associated regulatory asset of approximately $3.1 million, the estimated remaining liability at December 31, 2011. PSNC Energy expects to recover through rates any cost, net of insurance recovery, allocable to PSNC Energy arising from the remediation of these sites. REGULATORY MATTERS Material retail rate proceedings are described in more detail in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. SCANA is subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC as to the issuance of certain securities and other matters and is subject to the jurisdiction of the FERC as to certain acquisitions and other matters. South Carolina Electric & Gas Company SCE&G is subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC as to the issuance of certain securities and other matters; the SCPSC as to retail electric and gas rates, service, accounting, issuance of securities (other than short term borrowings) and other matters; and FERC as to issuance of short term borrowings, certain acquisitions and other matters. GENCO is subject to the jurisdiction of the SCPSC as to issuance of securities (other than short term borrowings) and is subject to the jurisdiction of FERC as to issuance of short term borrowings, accounting, certain acquisitions and other matters. SCE&G and GENCO are subject to regulation under the Federal Power Act, administered by FERC and DOE, in the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and in the sale of electric energy at wholesale for resale, as well as with respect to licensed hydroelectric projects and certain other matters, including accounting. Natural gas distribution companies may request annual adjustments to rates to reflect changes in revenues and expenses and changes in investment. Such annual adjustments are subject to certain qualifying criteria and review by the SCPSC. 45 Table of Contents Effective February 12, 2010, the PHMSA issued a final rule establishing integrity management requirements for gas distribution pipeline systems. SCE&G has developed a plan and procedures to ensure that it will be fully compliant with this rule. SCE&G believes that any additional costs incurred to comply with the rule will be recoverable through rates. Public Service Company of North Carolina, Incorporated PSNC Energy is subject to the jurisdiction of the NCUC as to gas rates, issuance of securities (other than notes with a maturity of two years or less or renewals of notes with a maturity of six years or less), accounting and other matters. The Pipeline Safety Act directed the DOT to establish the Integrity Management Rule for operations of natural gas systems with transmission pipelines located near moderate to high density populations. Of PSNC Energys approximately 617 miles of transmission pipeline subject to the Pipeline Safety Act, approximately 63 miles are located within these areas. Through December 2011, PSNC Energy has assessed 99 percent of the pipeline and is required to complete its assessment of the remainder by December 2012. PSNC Energy will be required to reinspect these same miles of pipeline approximately every seven years. PSNC Energy currently estimates the total costs through December 2012 to be $7.5 million for the initial assessments, not including any subsequent remediation that may be required. Costs totaling $2.2 million were recovered through rates over a three year period beginning November 1, 2008. The NCUC has authorized continuation of deferral accounting for certain costs incurred to comply with DOTs pipeline integrity management requirements until resolution of PSNC Energys next general rate proceeding. As a result, PSNC Energy incurred an additional $3.5 million in costs between November 2008 and December 2011. Carolina Gas Transmission Corporation CGT has approximately 72 miles of transmission line that are covered by the Integrity Management Rule of the Pipeline Safety Act. CGT currently estimates the total cost to be $10.5 million for the initial assessments and any subsequent remediation required through December 2012. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Following are descriptions of the Companys accounting policies and estimates which are most critical in terms of reporting financial condition or results of operations. Utility Regulation SCANAs regulated utilities record certain assets and liabilities that defer the recognition of expenses and revenues to future periods in accordance with accounting guidance for rate regulated utilities. In the future, in the event of deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment, the Company may no longer meet the criteria of accounting for rate regulated utilities, and could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities. Such an event could have a material effect on the results of operations, liquidity or financial position of the Companys and SCE&Gs Electric Distribution and Gas Distribution segments in the period the write off would be recorded. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of the Companys regulatory assets and liabilities, including those associated with the Companys environmental assessment program. The Companys generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market. If market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs, the Company could be required to write down its investment in those assets. The Company cannot predict whether any write downs would be necessary and, if they were, the extent to which they would affect the Companys results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded. As of December 31, 2011, the Companys net investments in fossil/hydro and nuclear generation assets were approximately $3.1 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. Revenue Recognition and Unbilled Revenues Revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers of the Companys utilities and retail gas operations are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual reading of their electric and gas meters, the Company records estimates for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. Such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to customers for which they have not yet been billed. Such unbilled revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class, 46 Table of Contents the effects of different rate schedules, changes in weather and, where applicable, the impact of weather normalization or other regulatory provisions of rate structures. The accrual of unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs. Accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of $169.1 million at December 31, 2011 and $221.1 million at December 31, 2010, compared to total revenues of $4.4 billion and $4.6 billion for the years 2011 and 2010, respectively. Nuclear Decommissioning Accounting for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future. Among the factors that could change SCE&Gs accounting estimates related to decommissioning costs are changes in technology, changes in regulatory and environmental remediation requirements, and changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and timing of cash flows. Changes in any of these estimates could significantly impact the Companys financial position and cash flows (although changes in such estimates should be earnings neutral, because these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers). SCE&Gs two thirds share of estimated site specific nuclear decommissioning costs for Summer Station Unit 1, including both the cost of decommissioning plant components that are and are not subject to radioactive contamination, totals $451.0 million, stated in 2006 dollars. Santee Cooper is responsible for decommissioning costs related to its one third ownership interest in Summer Station Unit 1. The cost estimate assumes that the site would be maintained over a period of 60 years in such a manner as to allow for subsequent decontamination that would permit release for unrestricted use. Under SCE&Gs method of funding decommissioning costs, amounts collected through rates are invested in insurance policies on the lives of certain Company personnel. SCE&G transfers to an external trust fund the amounts collected through electric rates, insurance proceeds and interest thereon, less expenses. The trusteed asset balance reflects the net cash surrender value of the insurance policies and cash held by the trust. Management intends for the fund, including earnings thereon, to provide for all eventual decommissioning expenditures on an after tax basis. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits The Company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined benefit pension plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and changes in funded status as a component of net periodic benefit cost or other comprehensive income, net of tax, or as a regulatory asset as required by accounting guidance. The Companys plan is adequately funded under current regulations. Accounting guidance requires the use of several assumptions, the selection of which may have a large impact on the resulting pension cost or income recorded. Among the more sensitive assumptions are those surrounding discount rates and expected returns on assets. Net pension cost of $17.3 million recorded in 2011 reflects the use of a 5.56% discount rate, derived using a cash flow matching technique, and an assumed 8.25% long term rate of return on plan assets. The Company believes that these assumptions were, and that the resulting pension cost amount was, reasonable. For purposes of comparison, using a discount rate of 5.31% in 2011 would have increased the Companys pension cost by $1.3 million. Had the assumed long term rate of return on assets been 8.00%, the Companys pension cost for 2011 would have increased by $1.9 million. The following information with respect to pension assets (and returns thereon) should also be noted. The Company determines the fair value of a majority of its pension assets utilizing market quotes or derives them from modeling techniques that incorporate market data. Only a small portion of assets are valued using less transparent (so called Level 3) methods. In developing the expected long term rate of return assumptions, the Company evaluates historical performance, targeted allocation amounts and expected payment terms. As of the beginning of 2011, the plans historical 10, 15, 20 and 25 year cumulative performance showed actual returns of 4.2%, 8.1%, 9.8% and 10.2%, respectively. The 2011 expected long term rate of return of 8.25% was based on a target asset allocation of 65% with equity managers and 35% with fixed income managers. Management regularly reviews such allocations and periodically rebalances the portfolio when considered appropriate. As of the beginning of 2012, the plans historical 10, 15, 20 and 25 year cumulative performance showed actual returns of 4.2%, 6.8%, 8.6% and 9.3%, respectively. For 2012, the expected rate of return is 8.25%. Due to turmoil in the financial markets and the resultant declines in plan asset values in the fourth quarter of 2008, the Company recorded significant amounts of pension cost in 2009, 2010 and 2011 compared to the pension income recorded previously. However, in February 2009, SCE&G was granted accounting orders by the SCPSC which allowed it to mitigate a significant portion of this pension cost by deferring as a regulatory asset the amount of pension expense above the level that was included in then current cost of service rates for its retail electric and gas distribution regulated operations. In July 2010, 47 Table of Contents upon the new retail electric base rates becoming effective, SCE&G began deferring as a regulatory asset all pension cost related to its regulated retail electric operations that otherwise would have been charged to expense. In November 2010, upon the updated gas rates becoming effective under the RSA, SCE&G began deferring as a regulatory asset all pension cost related to its regulated natural gas operations that otherwise would have been charged to expense. The pension trust is adequately funded under current regulations, and no contributions have been required since 1997. Management does not anticipate the need to make significant pension contributions until after 2012. The Company accounts for the cost of its postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans in a similar manner to that used for its defined benefit pension plan. This plan is unfunded, so no assumptions related to rate of return on assets impact the net expense recorded; however, the selection of discount rates can significantly impact the actuarial determination of net expense. The Company used a discount rate of 5.72%, derived using a cash flow matching technique, and recorded a net cost of $18.6 million for 2011. Had the selected discount rate been 5.47% (25 basis points lower than the discount rate referenced above), the expense for 2011 would have been $0.5 million higher. Because the plan provisions include caps on company per capita costs, healthcare cost inflation rate assumptions do not materially impact the net expense recorded. Asset Retirement Obligations The Company accrues for the legal obligation associated with the retirement of long lived tangible assets that result from their acquisition, construction, development and normal operation in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. The obligations are recognized at fair value in the period in which they are incurred, and associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as a part of the carrying amount of the related long lived assets. Because such obligations relate primarily to the Companys regulated utility operations, their recording has no significant impact on results of operations. As of December 31, 2011, the Company has recorded an ARO of $124 million for nuclear plant decommissioning (as discussed above) and an ARO of $349 million for other conditional obligations related to generation, transmission and distribution properties, including gas pipelines. All of the amounts recorded in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance are based upon estimates which are subject to varying degrees of imprecision, particularly since such payments may be made many years in the future. Changes in these estimates will be recorded over time; however, these changes in estimates are not expected to materially impact results of operations so long as the regulatory framework for the utilities remains in place. OTHER MATTERS Nuclear Generation SCE&G and Santee Cooper are parties to construction and operating agreements in which they agreed to be joint owners, and share operating costs and generation output, of two 1,117 MW nuclear generation units to be constructed at the site of Summer Station, with SCE&G responsible for 55 percent of the cost and receiving 55 percent of the output, and Santee Cooper responsible for and receiving the remaining 45 percent. Under these agreements, SCE&G will have the primary responsibility for oversight of the construction of the New Units and will be responsible for the operation of the New Units as they come online. SCE&G, on behalf of itself and as agent for Santee Cooper, has entered into the EPC Contract with the Consortium for the design and construction of the New Units. SCE&Gs share of the estimated cash outlays (future value, excluding AFC) totals approximately $6 billion for plant costs and related transmission infrastructure costs, which costs are projected based on historical one year and five year escalation rates as required by the SCPSC. As previously reported, SCE&G has been advised by Santee Cooper that it is reviewing certain aspects of its capital improvement program and long term power supply plan, including the level of its participation in the New Units. Santee Cooper has entered into a letter of intent with Duke that may result in Duke acquiring a portion of Santee Coopers ownership interest in the New Units. SCE&G is unable to predict whether any change in Santee Coopers ownership interest or the addition of new joint owners will increase project costs or delay the commercial operation dates of the New Units. Any such project cost increase or delay could be material. The Consortium has recently performed an impact study, at SCE&Gs request, related to various cost and timing alternatives arising from the delay in the issuance date of the COL from mid 2011, which was the date assumed when the EPC Contract was signed in 2008, to the early 2012 issuance date currently anticipated by SCE&G. The impact study analyzed three scenarios, including (1) compressing the construction schedule for the first New Unit but retaining the original substantial completion dates set forth in the EPC Contract, (2) extending the substantial completion date for the first New Unit to accommodate the COL delay, or (3) delaying the substantial completion date of the first New Unit and accelerating the 48 Table of Contents substantial completion date for the second New Unit. SCE&G has recently informed the Consortium that it intends to pursue scenario (3) and has also begun discussions concerning the update of cash flow forecasts and construction schedules on that basis. The parties to the EPC Contract have established both informal and formal dispute resolution procedures in order to resolve issues that arise during the course of constructing a project of this magnitude. During the course of activities under the EPC Contract, issues have materialized that may impact project budget and schedule, including those related to COL delays, design modifications of the shield building and certain pre fabricated modules for the New Units and unanticipated rock conditions at the site. These issues have resulted in assertions of contractual entitlement to recover additional costs and may result in requests for change orders from the Consortium. While SCE&G has not accepted the validity of any claims, the total amount of the claims presented (SCE&Gs portion in 2007 dollars) is approximately $188 million. SCE&G expects to resolve any such disputes through both the informal and formal procedures and anticipates that any additional costs that arise through such dispute resolution processes, as well as other costs identified from time to time (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), will be recoverable through rates. On February 29, 2012, SCE&G filed a petition with the SCPSC seeking an order approving a further updated capital cost and construction schedule that incorporates additional identifiable capital costs of approximately $6 million (SCE&Gs portion in 2007 dollars) related to new federal healthcare laws, information security measures and certain minor design modifications. That petition also includes increased capital costs of approximately $12 million (SCE&Gs portion in 2007 dollars) related to transmission infrastructure. Finally, that petition includes amounts of approximately $137 million (SCE&Gs portion in 2007 dollars) related to additional labor for the oversight of the New Units during construction and for preparing to operate the New Units, facilities and information technology systems required to support the New Units and their personnel. Future petitions would be filed for any costs arising from the resolution of the commercial claims discussed above. Under the BLRA, SCE&G is allowed to file revised rates with the SCPSC each year to incorporate the financing cost of any incremental construction work in progress incurred for new nuclear generation. Requested rate adjustments are based on SCE&Gs updated cost of debt and capital structure and on an allowed return on common equity of 11%. In September 2011, the SCPSC approved an increase of $52.8 million or 2.4% under the BLRA for the annual revised rates adjustment filing. The new retail electric rates were effective for bills rendered on and after October 30, 2011. In March 2011, a tsunami resulting from a massive earthquake severely damaged several nuclear generating units and their back up cooling systems in Japan. The impact of the disaster is being evaluated world wide, and numerous political and regulatory bodies, including those in the United States, are seeking to determine if additional safety measures should be required at existing nuclear facilities, as well as those planned for construction. In particular, on July 12, 2011, the NRCs Near Term Task Force issued a report titled Recommendations for Enhancing Reactor Safety in the 21st Century, which SCE&G is evaluating. SCE&G cannot predict what regulatory or other outcomes may be implemented in the United States, nor how such initiatives would impact SCE&Gs existing Summer Station or the licensing, construction or operation of the New Units. In December 2011, the NRC granted final design certification to Westinghouse for the AP1000 nuclear reactor, which is the reactor to be used for the New Units. This certification is a necessary step before the NRC can issue a COL for the New Units. In October 2011, the NRC conducted a mandatory hearing regarding the issuance of a COL for the New Units. This hearing followed the August 2011 completion of the FSER, in which the NRC staff concluded there were no safety aspects that would preclude issuing the COL, and the April 2011 completion of the FEIS, in which the NRC and the USACE concluded there were no environmental impacts that would preclude issuing the COL. Fuel Contract On January 27, 2011, SCE&G, for itself and as agent for Santee Cooper, and Westinghouse entered into a fuel alliance agreement and contracts for fuel fabrication and related services. Under these contracts, Westinghouse will supply enriched nuclear fuel assemblies for Summer Station Unit 1 and the New Units. Westinghouse will be SCE&Gs exclusive provider of such fuel assemblies on a cost plus basis. The fuel assemblies to be delivered under the contracts are expected to supply the nuclear fuel requirements of Summer Station Unit 1 and the New Units through 2033. SCE&G is dependent upon Westinghouse for providing fuel assemblies for the new AP1000 passive reactors in the New Units in the current and anticipated future absence of other commercially viable sources. Westinghouse currently provides maintenance and engineering support to Summer Station Unit 1 under a services alliance arrangement, and SCE&G has also contracted for Westinghouse to provide similar support services to the New Units upon their completion and commencement of commercial operation. Financial Regulatory Reform In July 2010, Dodd Frank became law. This Act provides for substantial additional regulation of over the counter and security based derivative instruments, among other things, and requires numerous rule makings by the Commodity 49 Table of Contents Futures Trading Commission and the SEC to implement. The Company is currently complying with these enacted regulations and intends to comply with regulations enacted in the future but cannot predict when the final regulations will be issued or what requirements they will impose. Off Balance Sheet Transactions Although SCANA invests in securities and business ventures, it does not hold significant investments in unconsolidated special purpose entities. SCANA does not engage in off balance sheet financing or similar transactions, although it is party to operating leases in the normal course of business, generally for office space, furniture, vehicles, equipment and rail cars.

See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. The information above includes those financial positions of Energy Marketing, SCE&G and PSNC Energy. SCE&G and PSNC Energy utilize futures, options and swaps to hedge gas purchasing activities. SCE&Gs tariffs include a PGA clause that provides for the recovery of actual gas costs incurred. The SCPSC has ruled that the results of SCE&Gs hedging activities are to be included in the PGA. As such, costs of related derivatives utilized by SCE&G to hedge gas purchasing activities are recoverable through weighted average cost of gas calculations. The offset to the change in fair value of these derivatives is deferred. PSNC Energys tariffs also include a provision for the recovery of actual gas costs incurred. PSNC Energy defers premiums, transaction fees, margin requirements and any realized gains or losses from its hedging program for subsequent recovery from customers. 52 Table of Contents 
 
ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OVERVIEW SCE&G is a regulated public utility engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity and in the purchase and sale, primarily at retail, and transportation of natural gas. SCE&Gs business is subject to seasonal fluctuations. Generally, sales of electricity are higher during the summer and winter months because of air conditioning and heating requirements, and sales of natural gas are greater in the winter months due to heating requirements. SCE&Gs electric service territory extends into 24 counties covering nearly 17,000 square miles in the central, southern and southwestern portions of South Carolina. The service area for natural gas encompasses all or part of 35 counties in South Carolina and covers approximately 22,600 square miles. Key Earnings Drivers and Outlook During 2011, economic growth showed modest signs of improvement in the southeast. Significant industrial announcements in SCE&Gs service territory were made during the year. In addition, SCE&Gs residential and commercial customer growth rates were positive, though customer usage by existing customers continued to decline. At December 31, 2011, a preliminary estimate of seasonally adjusted unemployment for South Carolina was 9.5%. Though improved from the 10.9% unemployment rate at December 31, 2010, unemployment remains high and continues to slow the pace of economic recovery in South Carolina. Over the next five years, key earnings drivers for SCE&G will be additions to utility rate base, consisting primarily of capital expenditures for new generating capacity, environmental facilities and system expansion. Other factors that will impact future earnings growth include the regulatory environment, customer growth and usage and the level of growth of operation and maintenance expenses and taxes. Electric Operations The electric operations segment is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, GENCO and Fuel Company, and is primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in South Carolina. At December 31, 2011 SCE&G provided electricity to approximately 664,000 customers in an area covering nearly 17,000 square miles. GENCO owns a coal fired generating station and sells electricity solely to SCE&G. Fuel Company acquires, owns and provides financing for SCE&Gs nuclear fuel, certain fossil fuels and emission allowances. Operating results for electric operations are primarily driven by customer demand for electricity, rates allowed to be charged to customers and the ability to control growth in costs. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity. SCE&Gs allowed return on equity is 10.7% for non BLRA expenditures, and 11.0% for BLRA related expenditures. Demand for electricity is primarily affected by weather, customer growth and the economy. SCE&G is able to recover the cost of fuel used in electric generation through retail customers bills, but increases in fuel costs affect electric prices and, therefore, the competitive position of electricity against other energy sources. New Nuclear Construction SCE&G and Santee Cooper are parties to construction and operating agreements in which they agreed to be joint owners, and share operating costs and generation output, of two 1,117 MW nuclear generation units to be constructed at the site of Summer Station, with SCE&G responsible for 55 percent of the cost and receiving 55 percent of the output, and Santee Cooper responsible for and receiving the remaining 45 percent. Under these agreements, SCE&G will have the primary responsibility for oversight of the construction of the New Units and will be responsible for the operation of the New Units as they come online. SCE&G, on behalf of itself and as agent for Santee Cooper, has entered into the EPC Contract with the Consortium for the design and construction of the New Units. SCE&Gs share of the estimated cash outlays (future value, excluding AFC) totals approximately $6 billion for plant costs and related transmission infrastructure costs, which costs are projected based on historical one year and five year escalation rates as required by the SCPSC. The successful completion of the New Units would result in a substantial increase in SCE&Gs utility plant in service. Financing and managing the construction of these plants, together with continuing environmental construction projects, represents a significant challenge to SCE&G. 91 Table of Contents As previously reported, SCE&G has been advised by Santee Cooper that it is reviewing certain aspects of its capital improvement program and long term power supply plan, including the level of its participation in the New Units. Santee Cooper has entered into a letter of intent with Duke that may result in Duke acquiring a portion of Santee Coopers ownership interest in the New Units. The Consortium has recently performed an impact study, at SCE&Gs request, related to various cost and timing alternatives arising from the delay in the issuance date of the COL from mid 2011, which was the date assumed when the EPC Contract was signed in 2008, to the early 2012 issuance date currently anticipated by SCE&G. SCE&G has recently informed the Consortium that it intends to pursue the alternative that would delay the substantial completion date of the first New Unit and accelerate the substantial completion date for the second New Unit and has also begun discussions concerning the update of cash flow forecasts and construction schedules on that basis. In December 2011, the NRC granted final design certification to Westinghouse for the AP1000 nuclear reactor, which is the reactor to be used for the New Units. This certification is a necessary step before the NRC can issue a COL for the New Units. In October 2011, the NRC conducted a mandatory hearing regarding the issuance of a COL for the New Units. This hearing followed the August 2011 completion of the FSER, in which the NRC staff concluded there were no safety aspects that would preclude issuing the COL, and the April 2011 completion of the FEIS, in which the NRC and the USACE concluded there were no environmental impacts that would preclude issuing the COL. See additional discussion at OTHER MATTERS Nuclear Generation. Environmental Significant federal legislative initiatives related to energy were unsuccessful in 2011, and Consolidated SCE&G expects such legislative initiatives will be hampered through 2012, due to each chamber of Congress being controlled by different political parties. The EPA, however, did issue new rules in 2011 related to air quality, including CSAPR and MATS, which require reductions in power plant emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury, among other substances. Though implementation of CSAPR was stayed by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia pending judicial review, Consolidated SCE&G cannot predict the outcome that judicial review will have on the rules implementation. In 2012, additional significant regulatory initiatives by the EPA and other federal agencies will likely proceed. These initiatives may require Consolidated SCE&G to build or otherwise acquire generating capacity from energy sources that exclude fossil fuels, nuclear or hydro facilities (for example, under an RES). It is also possible that new initiatives will be introduced to reduce carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions. Consolidated SCE&G cannot predict whether such initiatives will be enacted, and if they are, the conditions they would impose on utilities. The EPA has stated its intention to propose, in late 2012, new federal regulations affecting the management and disposal of CCR, such as ash. Such regulations could result in the treatment of some CCRs as hazardous waste and could impose significant costs to utilities, such as SCE&G and GENCO. The EPA is also expected to issue regulations during 2012 for cooling water intake structures to meet BACT at existing power generating stations. While Consolidated SCE&G cannot predict how extensive the regulations will be, Consolidated SCE&G believes that any additional costs imposed by such regulations would be recoverable through rates. Gas Distribution The Gas Distribution segment, comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G, is primarily engaged in the purchase, transportation and sale of natural gas to retail customers in portions of South Carolina. At December 31, 2011 this segment provided natural gas to approximately 317,000 customers in areas covering 22,600 square miles. Operating results for gas distribution are primarily influenced by customer demand for natural gas rates allowed to be charged to customers and the ability to control growth in costs. Embedded in the rates charged to customers is an allowed regulatory return on equity. Demand for natural gas is primarily affected by weather, customer growth, the economy and, for commercial and industrial customers, the availability and price of alternate fuels. Natural gas competes with electricity, propane and heating oil to serve the heating and, to a lesser extent, other household energy needs of residential and small commercial customers. This competition is generally based on price and convenience. Large commercial and industrial customers often have the ability to switch from natural gas to an alternate fuel, such as propane or fuel oil. Natural gas competes with these alternate fuels based on price. As a result, any significant disparity between supply and demand, either of natural gas or of alternate fuels, and due either to production or delivery disruptions or other factors, will affect price and impact SCE&Gs ability to 92 Table of Contents retain large commercial and industrial customers. One effect of the sluggish economy has been an overall decrease in demand for natural gas which, coupled with discoveries of shale gas in the United States, resulted in significantly lower prices for this commodity in 2010 and 2011. Low natural gas commodity prices are expected to continue in 2012 and beyond. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Net Income Net income for Consolidated SCE&G was as follows: Millions of dollars 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Net income $ 316.1 4.0 % $ 304.0 5.7 % $ 287.5 2011 vs 2010 Net income increased $46.7 million due to higher electric margin and by $1.0 million due to lower operation and maintenance expenses. This increase was partially offset by $4.1 million due to lower gas margin, higher depreciation expense of $9.1 million, higher property taxes of $6.2 million, higher interest expense of $11.0 million and lower AFC of $5.8 million. 2010 vs 2009 Net income increased $72.7 million due to higher electric margin and $6.5 million due to higher gas margin. These increases were partially offset by increased generation, transmission and distribution expenses of $10.4 million, by increased incentive compensation of $5.6 million, by increased interest expense of $14.2 million, by lower equity AFC of $8.8 million, by higher property taxes of $7.5 million and by $12.9 million due to the tax benefit and related interest income arising from the resolution of an income tax uncertainty in 2009. In late 2009, SCE&G redeemed for cash all outstanding shares of its cumulative preferred stock. Pension Cost Pension cost was recorded on Consolidated SCE&Gs income statements and balance sheets as follows: Millions of dollars 2011 2010 2009 Income Statement Impact: Reduction in employee benefit costs $ (2.5 ) $ (4.4 ) Other expense (income) $ 0.2 (4.2 ) (4.0 ) Balance Sheet Impact: Increase in capital expenditures 3.4 5.3 9.1 Component of amount receivable from Summer Station co owner 1.2 1.7 2.7 Increase in regulatory asset 9.1 18.6 31.2 Total Pension Cost $ 13.9 $ 18.9 $ 34.6 Prior to July 15, 2010, the SCPSC allowed SCE&G to defer as a regulatory asset the amount of pension cost exceeding amounts included in rates for its retail electric and gas distribution regulated operations. In connection with the SCPSCs July 2010 electric rate order and November 2010 natural gas RSA order, SCE&G began deferring, as a regulatory asset, all pension cost related to retail electric and gas operations that otherwise would have been charged to expense. These costs will be deferred until such time as future rate recovery is provided for by the SCPSC. No contribution to the pension trust was necessary, nor did limitations on benefit payments apply, in or for any period reported. AFC AFC is a utility accounting practice whereby a portion of the cost of both equity and borrowed funds used to finance construction (which is shown on the balance sheet as construction work in progress) is capitalized. Consolidated SCE&G includes an equity portion of AFC in nonoperating income and a debt portion of AFC in interest charges (credits) as noncash items, both of which have the effect of increasing reported net income. AFC represented approximately 4.5% of income before income taxes in 2011, 6.6% in 2010 and 11.5% in 2009, respectively. 93 Table of Contents Dividends Declared Consolidated SCE&Gs Boards of Directors declared the following dividends on common stock (all of which was held by SCANA) during 2011 and 2010: Declaration Date Dividend Amount Quarter Ended Payment Date February 11, 2011 $ 50.6 million March 31, 2011 April 1, 2011 April 21, 2011 49.0 million June 30, 2011 July 1, 2011 August 11, 2011 50.5 million September 30, 2011 October 1, 2011 October 26, 2011 39.3 million December 31, 2011 January 1, 2012 February 11, 2010 $ 46.6 million March 31, 2010 April 1, 2010 May 6, 2010 47.2 million June 30, 2010 July 1, 2010 July 29, 2010 50.7 million September 30, 2010 October 1, 2010 October 27, 2010 54.5 million December 31, 2010 January 1, 2011 Electric Operations Electric Operations is comprised of the electric operations of SCE&G, GENCO and Fuel Company. Electric operations sales margin (including transactions with affiliates) was as follows: Millions of dollars 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Operating revenues $ 2,432.2 2.5 % $ 2,373.9 10.5 % $ 2,148.9 Less: Fuel used in generation 922.5 (2.6 )% 946.7 15.1 % 822.3 Purchased power 19.2 12.9 % 17.0 1.2 % 16.8 Margin $ 1,490.5 5.7 % $ 1,410.2 7.7 % $ 1,309.8 2011 vs 2010 Margin increased by $49.0 million due to an increase in retail electric base rates approved by the SCPSC under the BLRA and by $34.5 million due to an SCPSC approved increase in retail electric base rates in July 2010. Also, margin in the first quarter of 2010 was adjusted downward by $17.4 million pursuant to an SCPSC regulatory order in connection with SCE&Gs annual fuel cost proceeding. These increases were partially offset by $12 million due to the effects of weather in 2010 before the implementation of the SCPSC approved eWNA and by lower customer usage of $8.7 million. 2010 vs 2009 Margin increased by $37.0 million due to higher SCPSC approved retail electric base rates in July 2010 and by $30.7 million due to an increase in base rates approved by the SCPSC under the BLRA. In addition, margin increased by $54.2 million (net of eWNA after its implementation) due to weather, by $5.8 million due to higher transmission revenue and off system sales and by $13.6 million due to the adoption of SCPSC approved lower electric depreciation rates in 2009, the effect of which was offset by a reduction in the recovery of fuel costs (electric revenue). During the first quarter of 2010, SCE&G deferred $25 million of incremental revenue as a result of the abnormally cold weather in its service territory (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). Also, margin in the first quarter of 2010 was adjusted downward by $17.4 million pursuant to an SCPSC regulatory order issued in connection with SCE&Gs annual fuel cost proceeding. (See also discussion at Income Taxes.) Finally, pursuant to the SCPSC approved retail electric base rate order in 2010, SCE&G adopted an eWNA thereby mitigating the effects of abnormal weather on its margins. Sales volumes (in GWh) related to the electric margin above, by class, were as follows: Classification 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Residential 8,232 (6.4 )% 8,791 11.4 % 7,893 Commercial 7,397 (3.7 )% 7,684 4.5 % 7,350 Industrial 5,938 1.3 % 5,863 10.1 % 5,324 Other 572 (1.5 )% 581 3.4 % 562 Total retail sales 22,139 (3.4 )% 22,919 8.5 % 21,129 Wholesale 2,049 4.3 % 1,965 (0.5 )% 1,975 Total 24,188 (2.8 )% 24,884 7.7 % 23,104 94 Table of Contents 2011 vs 2010 Total retail sales volumes decreased by 775 GWh due to weather. 2010 vs 2009 Total retail sales volumes increased by 1,209 GWh due to weather and by 539 GWh due to higher industrial sales volumes. Gas Distribution Gas Distribution is comprised of the local distribution operations of SCE&G. Gas distribution sales margin (including transactions with affiliates) was as follows: Millions of dollars 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Operating revenues $ 387.4 (12.3 )% $ 441.6 5.1 % $ 420.1 Less: Gas purchased for resale 239.7 (16.6 )% 287.4 4.0 % 276.3 Margin $ 147.7 (4.2 )% $ 154.2 7.2 % $ 143.8 2011 vs 2010 Margin decreased $8.2 million due to the SCPSC approved decrease in retail gas base rates which became effective with the first billing cycle of November 2010. This decrease was partially offset by an increase of $1.8 million due to the SCPSC approved increase in retail gas base rates which became effective with the first billing cycle of November 2011. 2010 vs 2009 Margin increased $9.2 million due to the SCPSC approved increase in retail gas base rates which became effective with the first billing cycle of November 2009 and $3.3 million due to increased customer usage. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of $2.2 million due to a SCPSC approved decrease in retail gas base rates which became effective with the first billing cycle of November 2010. Sales volumes (in DT) by class, including transportation gas, were as follows: Classification (in thousands) 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Residential 11,674 (21.9 )% 14,954 20.7 % 12,386 Commercial 12,071 (8.9 )% 13,255 4.1 % 12,736 Industrial 16,963 2.8 % 16,497 11.1 % 14,853 Transportation gas 4,376 16.7 % 3,749 12.8 % 3,323 Total 45,084 (7.0 )% 48,455 11.9 % 43,298 2011 vs 2010 Residential and commercial sales decreased primarily due to milder weather. Industrial and transportation sales increased primarily as a result of improved economic conditions and the competitive price of gas versus alternate fuel sources. 2010 vs 2009 Residential sales volume increased primarily due to customer growth and weather. Commercial and industrial sales volume increased primarily as a result of improved economic conditions. Other Operating Expenses Other operating expenses were as follows: Millions of dollars 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Other operation and maintenance $ 515.1 0.1 % $ 514.4 5.0 % $ 489.8 Depreciation and amortization 286.1 5.5 % 271.3 6.4 % 255.1 Other taxes 182.5 4.5 % 174.7 7.9 % 161.9 2011 vs 2010 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased primarily due to higher generation, transmission and distribution expenses. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to net property additions. Other taxes increased primarily due to higher property taxes. 95 Table of Contents 2010 vs 2009 Other operation and maintenance expenses increased by $16.9 million due to higher generation, transmission and distribution expenses and by $9.0 million due to higher incentive compensation and other benefits. Depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to net property additions. Other taxes increased primarily due to higher property taxes. Other Income (Expense) Other income (expense) includes the results of certain non utility activities. Components of other income (expense), were as follows: Millions of dollars 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Other income $ 4.9 (59.5 )% $ 12.1 (57.7 )% $ 28.6 Other expense (11.8 ) (21.9 )% (15.1 ) 33.6 % (11.3 ) Total $ (6.9 ) * $ (3.0 ) * $ 17.3 * Greater than 100% 2011 vs 2010 Total other income (expense) decreased primarily due to lower pension income in 2011. 2010 vs 2009 Total other income (expense) decreased $16.0 million due to decreased interest income. In September 2009, as a result of a favorable decision by the South Carolina Supreme Court, SCE&G was refunded previously contested EIZ Credits of $15.3 million and an additional $14.3 million of interest income. SCE&G recorded a multi year catch up adjustment in the third quarter of 2009 of approximately $6.3 million ($4.0 million after federal tax effect) as a reduction in income taxes. The interest income of $14.3 million ($8.8 million after tax effect) was recorded in the third quarter of 2009 within other income. Interest Expense Components of interest expense, net of the debt component of AFC, were as follows: Millions of dollars 2011 Change 2010 Change 2009 Interest on long term debt, net $ 191.0 7.3 % $ 178.0 13.9 % $ 156.3 Other interest expense 13.5 55.2 % 8.7 17.6 % 7.4 Total $ 204.5 9.5 % $ 186.7 14.1 % $ 163.7 Interest on long term debt increased in each year primarily due to increased long term borrowings over the prior year. Other interest expense increased in each year primarily due to higher principal balances on short term debt over the prior year. Income Taxes Income tax expense (and the effective tax rate) increased in 2011 over 2010 primarily due to the accelerated amortization of deferred EIZ Credits to offset undercollected fuel costs in 2010 pursuant to an SCPSC order and an increase in operating income. Income tax expense (and the effective tax rate) decreased in 2010 over 2009 primarily due to the above mentioned accelerated amortization of EIZ Credits to offset undercollected fuel costs and the accelerated amortization of EIZ Credits in connection with the July 2010 retail electric rate order. (See Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements for reconciling differences between income tax expense and statutory tax expense.) LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES Consolidated SCE&G anticipates that its contractual cash obligations will be met through internally generated funds and the incurrence of additional short and long term indebtedness and capital contributions from SCANA. Consolidated SCE&G expects that it has or can obtain adequate sources of financing to meet its projected cash requirements for the foreseeable future. Consolidated SCE&Gs ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the year ended December 31, 2011 was 3.13. Consolidated SCE&Gs cash requirements arise primarily from its operational needs, funding its construction programs and payment of dividends to SCANA. The ability of Consolidated SCE&G to replace existing plant investment, to expand to meet future demand for electricity and gas and to install equipment necessary to comply with environmental 96 Table of Contents regulations, will depend upon its ability to attract the necessary financial capital on reasonable terms. Consolidated SCE&G recovers the costs of providing services through rates charged to customers. Rates for regulated services are generally based on historical costs. As customer growth and inflation occur and Consolidated SCE&G continues its ongoing construction program, Consolidated SCE&G expects to seek increases in rates. Consolidated SCE&Gs future financial position and results of operations will be affected by Consolidated SCE&Gs ability to obtain adequate and timely rate and other regulatory relief. Cash outlays for property additions and construction expenditures, including nuclear fuel, net of AFC were $786 million in 2011 and are estimated to be $1.3 billion in 2012. Consolidated SCE&Gs current estimates of its capital expenditures for construction and nuclear fuel for 2012 2014, which are subject to continuing review and adjustment, are as follows: Estimated Capital Expenditures Millions of dollars 2012 2013 2014 Consolidated SCE&G Normal Generation $ 143 $ 96 $ 79 Transmission & Distribution 197 217 190 Other 26 14 21 Gas 49 51 57 Common 14 18 13 Total Consolidated SCE&G Normal 429 396 360 New Nuclear 954 952 727 Cash Requirements for Construction 1,383 1,348 1,087 Nuclear Fuel 44 110 55 Total Estimated Capital Expenditures $ 1,427 $ 1,458 $ 1,142 Consolidated SCE&Gs contractual cash obligations as of December 31, 2011 are summarized as follows: Contractual Cash Obligations Payments due by period Millions of dollars Total Less than 1 year 1 3 years 4 5 years More than 5 years Long term and short term debt including interest $ 7,204 $ 716 $ 746 $ 359 $ 5,383 Capital leases 7 2 3 2 Operating leases 37 7 9 21 Purchase obligations 4,335 955 2,306 412 662 Other commercial commitments 1,991 641 557 207 586 Total $ 13,574 $ 2,321 $ 3,621 $ 980 $ 6,652 Included in the table above in purchase obligations is SCE&Gs portion of a contractual agreement for the design and construction of the New Units at the Summer Station site. SCE&G expects to be a joint owner and share operating costs and generation output of the New Units, with SCE&G accounting for 55 percent of the cost and output and other joint owner(s) the remaining 45 percent. SCE&Gs estimated projected costs for the two additional units, in future dollars and excluding AFC, are summarized below. To the extent that actual contracts were put in place by December 31, 2011, obligations arising from these contracts are included in the purchase obligations within the Contractual Cash Obligations table above. Future Value Millions of dollars 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 After 2016 Total Project Cash Outlay $ 804 $ 825 $ 558 $ 575 $ 367 $ 232 Also included in purchase obligations are customary purchase orders under which SCE&G has the option to utilize certain vendors without the obligation to do so. SCE&G may terminate such arrangements without penalty. 97 Table of Contents Included in other commercial commitments are estimated obligations for coal and nuclear fuel purchases. SCE&G also has a legal obligation associated with the decommissioning and dismantling of Summer Station Unit 1 and other conditional asset retirement obligations that are not listed in the contractual cash obligations above. See Notes 1 and 10 to the consolidated financial statements. In addition, Consolidated SCE&G is party to certain NYMEX futures contracts for which any unfavorable market movements are funded in cash. These derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges and their effects are reflected within other comprehensive income until the anticipated sales transactions occur. See further discussion at Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. At December 31, 2011, Consolidated SCE&G had posted $45 million in cash collateral for interest rate derivative contracts. Financing Limits and Related Matters Consolidated SCE&Gs issuance of various securities, including long term and short term debt, is subject to customary approval or authorization by regulatory bodies including the SCPSC and FERC. Financing programs currently utilized by Consolidated SCE&G are as follows. SCE&G and GENCO have obtained FERC authority to issue short term indebtedness (pursuant to Section 204 of the Federal Power Act). SCE&G may issue up to $1.2 billion of unsecured promissory notes or commercial paper with maturity dates of one year or less, and GENCO may issue up to $150 million of short term indebtedness. The authority to make such issuances will expire in October 2012. SCE&G and Fuel Company are parties to five year credit agreements in the amount of $1.1 billion, of which $400 million relates to Fuel Company, which expire October 23, 2015. These credit agreements are used for general corporate purposes, including liquidity support for each companys commercial paper program and working capital needs and, in the case of Fuel Company, to finance or refinance the purchase of nuclear fuel, certain fossil fuels, and emission and other environmental allowances. These committed long term facilities are revolving lines of credit under credit agreements with a syndicate of banks. Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, Bank of America, N. A. and Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A. each provide 10% of the aggregate $1.5 billion credit facilities, Branch Banking and Trust Company, Credit Suisse AG, Cayman Islands Branch, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., Mizuho Corporate Bank, Ltd., TD Bank N.A. and UBS Loan Finance LLC each provide 8%, and Deutsche Bank AG New York Branch, Union Bank, N.A. and U.S. Bank National Association each provide 5.3%. Three other banks provide the remaining 6%. These bank credit facilities support the issuance of commercial paper by SCE&G (including Fuel Company). When the commercial paper markets are dislocated (due to either price or availability constraints), the credit facilities are available to support the borrowing needs of SCE&G (including Fuel Company). At December 31, 2011 and 2010, SCE&G (including Fuel Company) had available the following committed LOC and had outstanding the following LOC advances, commercial paper, and LOC supported letter of credit obligations: Millions of dollars 2011 2010 Lines of credit: Committed long term Total $ 1,100 $ 1,100 LOC advances Weighted average interest rate Outstanding commercial paper (270 or fewer days) $ 512 $ 381 Weighted average interest rate .56 % .42 % Letters of credit supported by an LOC $ .3 $ .3 Available $ 588 $ 719 As of December 31, 2011, Consolidated SCE&G had no outstanding borrowings under its $1.1 billion facilities, had approximately $512 million in commercial paper borrowings outstanding, was obligated under $.3 million in LOC supported letters of credit, and had approximately $16 million in cash and temporary investments. Consolidated SCE&G regularly monitors the commercial paper and short term credit markets to optimize the timing for repayment of the outstanding balance 98 Table of Contents on its draws, while maintaining appropriate levels of liquidity. Average short term borrowings outstanding during 2011 were approximately $485 million. Short term cash needs were met primarily through the issuance of commercial paper. At December 31, 2011, Consolidated SCE&G had net available liquidity of approximately $604 million, and its revolving credit facilities are in place until October 2015. Consolidated SCE&Gs long term debt portfolio has a weighted average maturity of over 18 years and bears an average cost of 6.18%. Most long term debt, other than facility draws, effectively bears fixed interest rates or is swapped to fixed. To further preserve liquidity, Consolidated SCE&G rigorously reviews its projected capital expenditures and operating costs and adjusts them where possible without impacting safety, reliability, and core customer service. SCE&Gs Restated Articles of Incorporation do not limit the dividends that may be paid on its common stock. However, SCE&Gs bond indenture contains provisions that, under certain circumstances, which SCE&G considers to be remote, could limit the payment of cash dividends on its common stock, all of which is beneficially owned by SCANA. With respect to hydroelectric projects, the Federal Power Act requires the appropriation of a portion of certain earnings therefrom. At December 31, 2011, approximately $58.8 million of retained earnings were restricted by this requirement as to payment of cash dividends on SCE&Gs common stock. SCE&G is subject to a bond indenture dated April 1, 1993 (Mortgage) covering substantially all of its electric properties under which all of its first mortgage bonds (Bonds) have been issued. Bonds may be issued under the Mortgage in an aggregate principal amount not exceeding the sum of (1) 70% of Unfunded Net Property Additions (as therein defined), (2) the aggregate principal amount of retired Bonds and (3) cash deposited with the trustee. Bonds, other than certain Bonds issued on the basis of retired Bonds, may be issued under the Mortgage only if Adjusted Net Earnings (as therein defined) for 12 consecutive months out of the 18 months immediately preceding the month of issuance are at least twice (2.0) the annual interest requirements on all outstanding Bonds and Bonds to be outstanding (Bond Ratio). For the year ended December 31, 2011, the Bond Ratio was 5.37. Financing Activities In January 2012, SCE&G issued $250 million of 4.35% first mortgage bonds due February 1, 2042. Proceeds from the sale were used to repay short term debt primarily incurred as a result of our construction program, to finance capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. In October 2011, SCE&G issued $30 million of 3.22% first mortgage bonds due October 18, 2021. Proceeds from the sale were used to redeem prior to maturity $30 million of 5.7% pollution control facilities revenue bonds due November 1, 2024 issued by Orangeburg County, South Carolina, on SCE&Gs behalf. In May 2011, SCE&G issued $100 million of 5.45% first mortgage bonds due February 1, 2041, which constituted a reopening of the prior offering of $250 million of 5.45% first mortgage bonds issued in January 2011. Proceeds from these sales were used to retire $150 million of SCE&G first mortgage bonds due February 1, 2011, to repay short term debt primarily incurred as a result of SCE&Gs construction program, to finance other capital expenditures and for general corporate purposes. During 2011 Consolidated SCE&G experienced net cash inflows related to financing activities of $193 million primarily due to the issuance of short term and long term debt and contribution from parent, partially offset by repayment of long term debt and payment of dividends. SCE&G paid approximately $31 million in 2011 to settle interest rate contracts associated with the issuance of long term debt. For additional information on significant financing transactions, see Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS Consolidated SCE&Gs regulated operations are subject to extensive regulation by various federal and state authorities in the areas of air quality, water quality, control of toxic substances and hazardous and solid wastes. Applicable statutes and rules include the CAA, CWA, Nuclear Waste Act and CERCLA, among others. Compliance with these 99 Table of Contents environmental requirements involves significant capital and operating costs, which the Company expects to recover through existing ratemaking provisions. For the three years ended December 31, 2011, Consolidated SCE&Gs capital expenditures for environmental control equipment at its fossil fuel generating stations totaled $164.0 million. In addition, Consolidated SCE&G made expenditures to operate and maintain environmental control equipment at its fossil plants of $7.9 million during 2011, $6.5 million during 2010, and $5.6 million during 2009, which are included in Other operation and maintenance expense and made expenditures to handle waste ash of $8.7 million in 2011, $5.9 million in 2010, and $6.5 million in 2009, which are included in Fuel used in electric generation. In addition, included within Other operation and maintenance expense is an annual amortization of $1.4 million in each of 2011, 2010, and 2009 related to SCE&Gs recovery of MGP remediation costs as approved by the SCPSC. It is not possible to estimate all future costs related to environmental matters, but forecasts for capitalized environmental expenditures for Consolidated SCE&G are $35.0 million for 2012 and $126.1 million for the four year period 2013 2016. These expenditures are included in Consolidated SCE&Gs Estimated Capital Expenditures table, are discussed in Liquidity and Capital Resources, and include known costs related to the matters discussed below. At the state level, no significant environmental legislation that would affect Consolidated SCE&Gs operations advanced during 2011. Consolidated SCE&G cannot predict whether such legislation will be introduced or enacted in 2012, or if new regulations or changes to existing regulations at the state level will be implemented in the coming year. Several regulatory initiatives at the federal level did advance in 2011 and more are expected to advance in 2012 as described below. Air Quality With the pervasive emergence of concern over the issue of global climate change as a significant influence upon the economy, Consolidated SCE&G is subject to climate related financial risks, including those involving regulatory requirements responsive to GHG emissions, as well as those involving physical impacts which could arise from global climate change. Other business and financial risks arising from such climate change could also arise. Consolidated SCE&G cannot predict all of the climate related regulatory and physical risks nor the related consequences which might impact Consolidated SCE&G, and the following discussion should not be considered all inclusive. From a regulatory perspective, Consolidated SCE&G continually monitors and evaluates current and projected emission levels and strives to comply with all state and federal regulations regarding those emissions. Consolidated SCE&G participates in the sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide emission allowance programs with respect to coal plant emissions and also has constructed additional pollution control equipment at several larger coal fired electric generating plants. Further, SCE&G is engaged in pre construction activities of the New Units which are expected to reduce GHG emission levels significantly once they are completed and dispatched by potentially displacing some of the current coal fired generation sources. In 2005, the EPA issued the CAIR, which required the District of Columbia and 28 states, including South Carolina, to reduce nitrogen oxide and sulfur dioxide emissions in order to attain mandated state levels. CAIR set emission limits to be met in two phases beginning in 2009 and 2015, respectively, for nitrogen oxide and beginning in 2010 and 2015, respectively, for sulfur dioxide. SCE&G and GENCO determined that additional air quality controls would be needed to meet the CAIR requirements. On July 6, 2011 the EPA issued the CSAPR. This rule replaced CAIR and the Clean Air Transport Rule proposed in July 2010 and is aimed at addressing power plant emissions that may contribute to air pollution in other states. CSAPR requires states in the eastern United States to reduce power plant emissions, specifically sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide. On December 30, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia issued an order staying CSAPR and reinstating CAIR pending resolution of an appeal of CSAPR. Air quality control installations that SCE&G and GENCO have already completed should assist the Company in complying with the CSAPR and the reinstated CAIR. Consolidated SCE&G will continue to pursue strategies to comply with all applicable environmental regulations. Any costs incurred to comply with this rule or other rules issued by the EPA in the future are expected to be recoverable through rates. In June 2010, the EPA issued a final rule for a one hour ambient air quality standard for sulfur dioxide. This new standard may require some of SCE&Gs smaller coal fired units to reduce their sulfur dioxide emissions to a level to be determined by the EPA and or DHEC. The costs incurred to comply with this new standard are expected to be recovered through rates. Physical effects associated with climate changes could include the impact of possible changes in weather patterns, such as storm frequency and intensity, and the resultant potential damage to Consolidated SCE&Gs electric system, as well as impacts on employees and customers and on its supply chain and many others. Much of the service territory of SCE&G is subject to the damaging effects of Atlantic and Gulf coast hurricanes and also to the damaging impact of winter ice storms. 100 Table of Contents To help mitigate the financial risks arising from these potential occurrences, SCE&G maintains insurance on certain properties and has collected funds from customers for its storm damage reserve (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). As part of its ongoing operations, SCE&G maintains emergency response and storm preparation plans and teams, and applicable personnel participate in ongoing training and related simulations in advance of such storms, all in order to allow Consolidated SCE&G to protect its assets and to return its systems to normal reliable operation in a timely fashion following any such event. In December 2009, the EPA issued a final finding that atmospheric concentrations of GHG endanger public health and welfare within the meaning of Section 202(a) of the CAA. The rule, which became effective in January 2010, enables the EPA to regulate GHG emissions under the CAA. The EPA has committed to issue new rules regulating such emissions in 2012. The Company expects that any costs incurred to comply with GHG emission requirements will be recoverable through rates. In 2005, the EPA issued the CAMR which established a mercury emissions cap and trade program for coal fired power plants. Numerous parties challenged the rule and, on February 8, 2008, the United States Circuit Court for the District of Columbia vacated the rule for electric utility steam generating units. In March 2011, the EPA proposed new standards for mercury and other specified air pollutants. The rule, which becomes effective April 16, 2012, provides up to four years for facilities to meet the standards. The rule is currently being evaluated by Consolidated SCE&G. Any costs incurred to comply with this rule or other rules issued by the EPA in the future are expected to be recoverable through rates. The EPA is conducting an enforcement initiative against the utilities industry related to the NSR provisions and the new source performance standards of the CAA. As part of the initiative, many utilities have received requests for information under Section 114 of the CAA. In addition, the DOJ, on behalf of EPA, has taken civil enforcement action against several utilities. The primary basis for these actions is the assertion by EPA that maintenance activities undertaken by the utilities at their coal fired power plants constituted major modifications which required the installation of costly BACT. Some of the utilities subject to the actions have reached settlement. To date, SCE&G and GENCO have received and responded to Section 114 requests for information related to Canadys, Wateree and Williams Stations. The current state of continued DOJ civil enforcement is the subject of industry wide speculation, and it cannot be determined whether Consolidated SCE&G will be affected by the initiative in the future. Consolidated SCE&G believes that any enforcement action relative to its compliance with the CAA would be without merit. Consolidated SCE&G further believes that installation of equipment responsive to CAIR previously discussed will mitigate many of the alleged concerns with NSR. Water Quality The CWA provides for the imposition of effluent limitations that require treatment for wastewater discharges. Under the CWA, compliance with applicable limitations is achieved under a national permit program. Discharge permits have been issued and renewed for all of SCE&Gs and GENCOs generating units. Concurrent with renewal of these permits, the permitting agency has implemented a more rigorous program of monitoring and controlling discharges, has modified the requirements for new cooling water intake structures, and has required strategies for toxicity reduction in wastewater streams. The EPA has said that it will issue a rule by mid 2012 that modifies requirements for existing cooling water intake structures. Consolidated SCE&G is conducting studies and is developing or implementing compliance plans for these initiatives. Congress is expected to consider further amendments to the CWA. Such legislation may include limitations to mixing zones and toxicity based standards. These provisions, if passed, could have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Consolidated SCE&G. Consolidated SCE&G believes that any additional costs imposed by such regulations would be recoverable through rates. Hazardous and Solid Wastes The EPA stated its intention to propose in late 2012 new federal regulations affecting the management and disposal of CCRs, such as ash. Such regulations could result in the treatment of some CCRs as hazardous waste and could impose significant costs to utilities, such as SCE&G and GENCO. While Consolidated SCE&G cannot predict how extensive the regulations will be, Consolidated SCE&G believes that any additional costs imposed by such regulations would be recoverable through rates. The Nuclear Waste Act required that the United States government accept and permanently dispose of high level radioactive waste and spent nuclear fuel by January 31, 1998. The Nuclear Waste Act also imposed on utilities the primary responsibility for storage of their spent nuclear fuel until the repository is available. SCE&G entered into a Standard Contract 101 Table of Contents for Disposal of Spent Nuclear Fuel and or High Level Radioactive Waste with the DOE in 1983. As of December 31, 2011, the federal government has not accepted any spent fuel from Summer Station Unit 1 or any other nuclear generating facility, and it remains unclear when the repository may become available. SCE&G has on site spent nuclear fuel storage capability until at least 2017 and expects to be able to expand its storage capacity to accommodate the spent nuclear fuel output for the life of Summer Station Unit 1 through dry cask storage or other technology as it becomes available. The provisions of CERCLA authorize the EPA to require the clean up of hazardous waste sites. In addition, the state of South Carolina has a similar law. Consolidated SCE&G maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate current and former operations sites that could require environmental clean up. In addition, regulators from the EPA and other federal or state agencies periodically notify Consolidated SCE&G that it may be required to perform or participate in the investigation and remediation of a hazardous waste site. As site assessments are initiated, estimates are made of the amount of expenditures, if any, deemed necessary to investigate and remediate each site. These estimates are refined as additional information becomes available; therefore, actual expenditures may differ significantly from the original estimates. Amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and clean up relate solely to regulated operations. Such amounts are recorded in deferred debits and amortized with recovery provided through rates. Consolidated SCE&G has assessed the following matters: Electric Operations SCE&G has been named, along with 53 others, by the EPA as a PRP at the AER Superfund site located in Augusta, Georgia. The PRPs funded a Remedial Investigation and Risk Assessment which was completed and approved by the EPA and funded a Feasibility Study that was completed in 2010. A clean up cost has been estimated and the PRPs have agreed to an allocation of those costs based primarily on volume and type of material each PRP sent to the site. SCE&Gs allocation did not have a material impact on its results of operations, cash flows or financial condition. SCE&G maintains an environmental assessment program to identify and evaluate its current and former operations sites that could require environmental clean up. As site assessments are initiated, estimates are made of the amount of expenditures, if any, deemed necessary to investigate and remediate each site. These estimates are refined as additional information becomes available; therefore, actual expenditures could differ significantly from the original estimates. Amounts estimated and accrued to date for site assessments and clean up relate solely to regulated operations. SCE&G defers site assessment and cleanup costs and expects to recover them through rates. Gas Distribution SCE&G is responsible for four decommissioned MGP sites in South Carolina which contain residues of by product chemicals. These sites are in various stages of investigation, remediation and monitoring under work plans approved by DHEC. SCE&G anticipates that major remediation activities at these sites will continue until 2014 and will cost an additional $8.3 million. SCE&G expects to recover any cost arising from the remediation of MGP sites through rates and insurance settlements. At December 31, 2011, deferred amounts, net of amounts previously recovered through rates and insurance settlements, totaled $24.9 million and are included in regulatory assets. REGULATORY MATTERS Material retail rate proceedings are described in more detail in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements. SCE&G is subject to the jurisdiction of the SEC as to the issuance of certain securities and other matters; the SCPSC as to retail electric and gas rates, service, accounting, issuance of securities (other than short term borrowings) and other matters; and FERC as to issuance of short term borrowings, certain acquisitions and other matters. GENCO is subject to the jurisdiction of the SCPSC as to issuance of securities (other than short term borrowings) and is subject to the jurisdiction of FERC as to issuance of short term borrowings, accounting, certain acquisitions and other matters. SCE&G and GENCO are subject to regulation under the Federal Power Act, administered by FERC and DOE, in the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce and in the sale of electric energy at wholesale for resale, as well as with respect to licensed hydroelectric projects and certain other matters, including accounting. 102 Table of Contents The RSA allows natural gas distribution companies to request annual adjustments to rates to reflect changes in revenues and expenses and changes in investment. Such annual adjustments are subject to certain qualifying criteria and review by the SCPSC. Effective February 12, 2010, the PHMSA issued a final rule establishing integrity management requirements for gas distribution pipeline systems. SCE&G has developed a plan and procedures to ensure that it will be fully compliant with this rule. SCE&G believes that any additional costs incurred to comply with the rule will be recoverable through rates. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES Following are descriptions of Consolidated SCE&Gs accounting policies and estimates which are most critical in terms of reporting financial condition or results of operations. Utility Regulation Consolidated SCE&Gs regulated operations record certain assets and liabilities that defer the recognition of expenses and revenues to future periods in accordance with accounting guidance for rate regulated utilities. In the future, in the event of deregulation or other changes in the regulatory environment, Consolidated SCE&G may no longer meet the criteria of accounting for rate regulated utilities, and could be required to write off its regulatory assets and liabilities. Such an event could have a material effect on the results of operations, liquidity or financial position of Consolidated SCE&Gs Electric Distribution and Gas Distribution segments in the period the write off would be recorded. See Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for a description of Consolidated SCE&Gs regulatory assets and liabilities, including those associated with Consolidated SCE&Gs environmental assessment program. Consolidated SCE&Gs generation assets would be exposed to considerable financial risks in a deregulated electric market. If market prices for electric generation do not produce adequate revenue streams and the enabling legislation or regulatory actions do not provide for recovery of the resulting stranded costs, Consolidated SCE&G could be required to write down its investment in those assets. Consolidated SCE&G cannot predict whether any write downs would be necessary and, if they were, the extent to which they would affect Consolidated SCE&Gs results of operations in the period in which they would be recorded. As of December 31, 2011, Consolidated SCE&Gs net investments in fossil/hydro and nuclear generation assets were $3.1 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively. Revenue Recognition and Unbilled Revenues Revenues related to the sale of energy are recorded when service is rendered or when energy is delivered to customers. Because customers are billed on cycles which vary based on the timing of the actual reading of their electric and gas meters, SCE&G records estimates for unbilled revenues at the end of each reporting period. Such unbilled revenue amounts reflect estimates of the amount of energy delivered to customers for which they have not yet been billed. Such unbilled revenues reflect consideration of estimated usage by customer class, the effects of different rate schedules, changes in weather and, where applicable, the impact of weather normalization provisions of rate structures. The accrual of unbilled revenues in this manner properly matches revenues and related costs. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, accounts receivable included unbilled revenues of $117.8 million and $123.4 million, respectively, compared to total revenues of $2.8 billion for each of such years. Nuclear Decommissioning Accounting for decommissioning costs for nuclear power plants involves significant estimates related to costs to be incurred many years in the future. Among the factors that could change SCE&Gs accounting estimates related to decommissioning costs are changes in technology, changes in regulatory and environmental remediation requirements, and changes in financial assumptions such as discount rates and timing of cash flows. Changes in any of these estimates could significantly impact SCE&Gs financial position and cash flows (although changes in such estimates should be earnings neutral, because these costs are expected to be collected from ratepayers). SCE&Gs two thirds share of estimated site specific nuclear decommissioning costs for Summer Station Unit 1, including both the cost of decommissioning plant components that are and are not subject to radioactive contamination, totals $451.0 million, stated in 2006 dollars. Santee Cooper is responsible for decommissioning costs related to its one third ownership interest in Summer Station Unit 1. The cost estimate assumes that the site would be maintained over a period of 60 years in such a manner as to allow for subsequent decontamination that would permit release for unrestricted use. 103 Table of Contents Under SCE&Gs method of funding decommissioning costs, amounts collected through rates are invested in insurance policies on the lives of certain Company personnel. SCE&G transfers to an external trust fund the amounts collected through electric rates, insurance proceeds and interest thereon, less expenses. The trusteed asset balance reflects the net cash surrender value of the insurance policies and cash held by the trust. Management intends for the fund, including earnings thereon, to provide for all eventual decommissioning expenditures on an after tax basis. Accounting for Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits SCANA recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of its defined benefit pension plan as an asset or liability in its balance sheet and changes in funded status as a component of net periodic benefit cost or other comprehensive income, net of tax, or as a regulatory asset as required by accounting guidance. SCANAs plan is adequately funded under current regulations. Accounting guidance requires the use of several assumptions, the selection of which may have a large impact on the resulting pension cost or income recorded. Among the more sensitive assumptions are those surrounding discount rates and expected returns on assets. Net pension cost of $17.3 million ($13.9 million attributable to SCE&G) recorded in 2011 reflects the use of a 5.56% discount rate, derived using a cash flow matching technique, and an assumed 8.25% long term rate of return on plan assets. SCANA believes that these assumptions were, and that the resulting pension income amount was, reasonable. For purposes of comparison, using a discount rate of 5.31% in 2011 would have increased SCANAs pension cost by $1.3 million. Had the assumed long term rate of return on assets been 8.00%, SCANAs pension cost for 2011 would have increased by $1.9 million. Due to turmoil in the financial markets and the resultant declines in plan asset values in the fourth quarter of 2008, SCE&G recorded significant amounts of pension cost in 2009, 2010 and 2011 compared to the pension income recorded previously. However, in February 2009, SCE&G was granted accounting orders by the SCPSC which allowed it to mitigate a significant portion of this increased pension cost by deferring as a regulatory asset the amount of pension expense above the level that was included in then current cost of service rates for its retail electric and gas distribution regulated operations. In July 2010, upon the new retail electric base rates becoming effective, SCE&G began deferring as a regulatory asset all pension cost related to its regulated retail electric operations that otherwise would have been charged to expense. In November 2010, upon the updated gas rates becoming effective under the RSA, SCE&G began deferring as a regulatory asset, all pension cost related to its regulated natural gas operations that otherwise would have been charged to expense. The pension trust is adequately funded under current regulations, and no contributions have been required since 1997. Management does not anticipate the need to make significant pension contributions until after 2012. SCANA accounts for the cost of its postretirement medical and life insurance benefit plans in a similar manner to that used for its defined benefit pension plan. This plan is unfunded, so no assumptions related to rate of return on assets impact the net expense recorded; however, the selection of discount rates can significantly impact the actuarial determination of net expense. SCANA used a discount rate of 5.72%, derived using a cash flow matching technique, and recorded a net cost to SCE&G of $14.0 million for 2011. Had the selected discount rate been 5.47% (25 basis points lower than the discount rate referenced above), the expense for 2011 would have been $0.4 million higher. Because the plan provisions include caps on company per capita costs, healthcare cost inflation rate assumptions do not materially impact the net expense recorded. Asset Retirement Obligations Consolidated SCE&G accrues for the legal obligation associated with the retirement of long lived tangible assets that result from their acquisition, construction, development and normal operation in accordance with applicable accounting guidance. The obligations are recognized at fair value in the period in which they are incurred and associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as a part of the carrying amount of the related long lived assets. Because such obligations relate primarily to Consolidated SCE&Gs regulated utility operations, their recording has no significant impact on results of operations. As of December 31, 2011, Consolidated SCE&G has recorded AROs of $124 million for nuclear plant decommissioning (as discussed above) and $326 million for other conditional obligations related to generation, transmission and distribution properties, including gas pipelines. All of the amounts recorded in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance are based upon estimates which are subject to varying degrees of imprecision, particularly since such payments may be made many years in the future. Changes in these estimates will be recorded over time; however, these changes in estimates are not expected to materially impact results of operations so long as the regulatory framework for utilities remains in place. OTHER MATTERS Nuclear Generation SCE&G and Santee Cooper are parties to construction and operating agreements in which they agreed to be joint owners, and share operating costs and generation output, of two 1,117 MW nuclear generation units to be constructed at the 104 Table of Contents site of Summer Station, with SCE&G responsible for 55 percent of the cost and receiving 55 percent of the output, and Santee Cooper responsible for and receiving the remaining 45 percent. Under these agreements, SCE&G will have the primary responsibility for oversight of the construction of the New Units and will be responsible for the operation of the New Units as they come online. SCE&G, on behalf of itself and as agent for Santee Cooper, has entered into the EPC Contract with the Consortium for the design and construction of the New Units. SCE&Gs share of the estimated cash outlays (future value, excluding AFC) totals approximately $6 billion for plant costs and related transmission infrastructure costs, which costs are projected based on historical one year and five year escalation rates as required by the SCPSC. As previously reported, SCE&G has been advised by Santee Cooper that it is reviewing certain aspects of its capital improvement program and long term power supply plan, including the level of its participation in the New Units. Santee Cooper has entered into a letter of intent with Duke that may result in Duke acquiring a portion of Santee Coopers ownership interest in the New Units. SCE&G is unable to predict whether any change in Santee Coopers ownership interest or the addition of new joint owners will increase project costs or delay the commercial operation dates of the New Units. Any such project cost increase or delay could be material. The Consortium has recently performed an impact study, at SCE&Gs request, related to various cost and timing alternatives arising from the delay in the issuance date of the COL from mid 2011, which was the date assumed when the EPC Contract was signed in 2008, to the early 2012 issuance date currently anticipated by SCE&G. The impact study analyzed three scenarios, including (1) compressing the construction schedule for the first New Unit but retaining the original substantial completion dates set forth in the EPC Contract, (2) extending the substantial completion date for the first New Unit to accommodate the COL delay, or (3) delaying the substantial completion date of the first New Unit and accelerating the substantial completion date for the second New Unit. SCE&G has recently informed the Consortium that it intends to pursue scenario (3) and has also begun discussions concerning the update of cash flow forecasts and construction schedules on that basis. The parties to the EPC Contract have established both informal and formal dispute resolution procedures in order to resolve issues that arise during the course of constructing a project of this magnitude. During the course of activities under the EPC Contract, issues have materialized that may impact project budget and schedule, including those related to COL delays, design modifications of the shield building and certain pre fabricated modules for the New Units and unanticipated rock conditions at the site. These issues have resulted in assertions of contractual entitlement to recover additional costs and may result in requests for change orders from the Consortium. While SCE&G has not accepted the validity of any claims, the total amount of the claims presented (SCE&Gs portion in 2007 dollars) is approximately $188 million. SCE&G expects to resolve any such disputes through both the informal and formal procedures and anticipates that any additional costs that arise through such dispute resolution processes, as well as other costs identified from time to time (see Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements), will be recoverable through rates. On February 29, 2012, SCE&G filed a petition with the SCPSC seeking an order approving a further updated capital cost and construction schedule that incorporates additional identifiable capital costs of approximately $6 million (SCE&Gs portion in 2007 dollars) related to new federal healthcare laws, information security measures and certain minor design modifications. That petition also includes increased capital costs of approximately $12 million (SCE&Gs portion in 2007 dollars) related to transmission infrastructure. Finally, that petition includes amounts of approximately $137 million (SCE&Gs portion in 2007 dollars) related to additional labor for the oversight of the New Units during construction and for preparing to operate the New Units, facilities and information technology systems required to support the New Units and their personnel. Future petitions would be filed for any costs arising from the resolution of the commercial claims discussed above. Under the BLRA, SCE&G is allowed to file revised rates with the SCPSC each year to incorporate the financing cost of any incremental construction work in progress incurred for new nuclear generation. Requested rate adjustments are based on SCE&Gs updated cost of debt and capital structure and on an allowed return on common equity of 11%. In September 2011, the SCPSC approved an increase of $52.8 million or 2.4% under the BLRA for the annual revised rates adjustment filing. The new retail electric rates were effective for bills rendered on and after October 30, 2011. In March 2011, a tsunami resulting from a massive earthquake severely damaged several nuclear generating units and their back up cooling systems in Japan. The impact of the disaster is being evaluated world wide, and numerous political and regulatory bodies, including those in the United States, are seeking to determine if additional safety measures should be required at existing nuclear facilities, as well as those planned for construction. In particular, on July 12, 2011, the NRCs Near Term Task Force issued a report titled Recommendations for Enhancing Reactor Safety in the 21st Century, which SCE&G is evaluating. SCE&G cannot predict what regulatory or other outcomes may be implemented in the United States, nor how such initiatives would impact SCE&Gs existing Summer Station or the licensing, construction or operation of the New Units. 105 Table of Contents In December 2011, the NRC granted final design certification to Westinghouse for the AP1000 nuclear reactor, which is the reactor to be used for the New Units. This certification is a necessary step before the NRC can issue a COL for the New Units. In October 2011, the NRC conducted a mandatory hearing regarding the issuance of a COL for the New Units. This hearing followed the August 2011 completion of the FSER, in which the NRC staff concluded there were no safety aspects that would preclude issuing the COL, and the April 2011 completion of the FEIS, in which the NRC and the USACE concluded there were no environmental impacts that would preclude issuing the COL. Fuel Contract On January 27, 2011, SCE&G, for itself and as agent for Santee Cooper, and Westinghouse entered into a fuel alliance agreement and contracts for fuel fabrication and related services. Under these contracts, Westinghouse will supply enriched nuclear fuel assemblies for Summer Station Unit 1 and the New Units. Westinghouse will be SCE&Gs exclusive provider of such fuel assemblies on a cost plus basis. The fuel assemblies to be delivered under the contracts are expected to supply the nuclear fuel requirements of Summer Station Unit 1 and the New Units through 2033. SCE&G is dependent upon Westinghouse for providing fuel assemblies for the new AP1000 passive reactors in the New Units in the current and anticipated future absence of other commercially viable sources. Westinghouse currently provides maintenance and engineering support to Summer Station Unit 1 under a services alliance arrangement, and SCE&G has also contracted for Westinghouse to provide similar support services to the New Units upon their completion and commencement of commercial operation. Financial Regulatory Reform In July 2010, Dodd Frank became law. This Act provides for substantial additional regulation of over the counter and security based derivative instruments, among other things, and requires numerous rule makings by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the SEC to implement. Consolidated SCE&G is currently complying with these enacted regulations and intends to comply with regulations in the future but cannot predict when the final regulations will be issued or what requirements they will impose. Off Balance Sheet Transactions Consolidated SCE&G does not hold significant investments in unconsolidated special purpose entities. Consolidated SCE&G does not engage in off balance sheet financing or similar transactions, although it is party to incidental operating leases in the normal course of business, generally for office space, furniture, vehicles, equipment and rail cars, none of which are considered significant. Claims and Litigation For a description of claims and litigation see Item 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS and Note 10 to the consolidated financial statements. 106 Table of Contents ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK All financial instruments held by Consolidated SCE&G described below are held for purposes other than trading. The tables below provide information about long term debt issued by Consolidated SCE&G which is sensitive to changes in interest rates. For debt obligations, the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates. For interest rate swaps, the figures shown reflect notional amounts, weighted average rates and related maturities. Fair values for debt represent quoted market prices.

See Note 6 to the consolidated financial statements. SCE&Gs tariffs include a PGA clause that provides for the recovery of actual gas costs incurred. The SCPSC has ruled that the results of hedging activities are to be included in the PGA. As such, costs of related derivatives utilized by SCE&G to hedge gas purchasing activities are recoverable through weighted average cost of gas calculations. The offset to the change in fair value of these derivatives is deferred. 108 Table of Contents
