Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations DESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS Overview Securities market returns were mixed for much of 2004 due to the cumulative effects of ongoing geopolitical, economic and energy market uncertainties, concerns about rising interest rates, and a close presidential election. While this environment weighed on client engagement, the Company actively pursued its strategy of refocusing on its core client base, improving product and service offerings for those clients, lowering pricing, and streamlining its overall infrastructure. In addition, the Company embarked on a firm wide cost reduction effort designed to mitigate the effects of its price reductions and to improve overall efficiency and productivity. During the fourth quarter of 2004, the election was decided and market returns turned positive. In this improved environment, client asset valuations recovered and daily average revenue trades rose by 39% over third quarter lows. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, the Standard and Poors 500 Index, and the Nasdaq Composite Index ended 2004 up 3%, 9%, and 9%, respectively. Total client assets housed at the Company rose by 12% during 2004 to $1.08 trillion; net new client assets brought to the Company totaled $50.3 billion for the year, including $16.8 billion in the fourth quarter, the highest in 13 quarters. Overall, the Companys price cuts contributed to a 14% decline in trading revenues for 2004, yet continued success in attracting client assets and building stronger client relationships led to a 17% increase in non trading revenues and total revenue growth of 8%. Expenses rose by 12% over 2003 levels, reflecting the reinstatement of the Companys 401(k) match and the payment of higher discretionary bonuses, an increased marketing communications investment, and the recognition of $261 million in after tax charges relating to the Companys exit from the capital markets business and its cost reduction effort. As a result, net income declined by 39% from 2003, and the Companys 2004 profit margin was 6.8%, compared with 12.1% in the prior year. The Companys 2004 cost reduction effort enabled the firm to steadily reduce its operating expense base throughout 2004, and about $300 million in annualized cost savings were identified and implemented by year end. The Company generates cash primarily through the revenues of its brokerage and banking subsidiaries. These revenues are classified into non trading and trading categories. The Company earns non trading revenues primarily through: o Asset management and administration fees earned through its proprietary and third party mutual fund offerings, as well as fee based investment management and advisory services; and o Interest revenue earned on margin loans, loans to banking clients, and investments. Non trading revenues are impacted by securities valuations, interest rates, the Companys ability to attract new clients, and client activity levels. The Company earns trading revenues through: o Commissions earned for executing trades for clients; and o Principal transaction revenues for trading activity in fixed income securities. Trading revenues are impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of equity prices in the securities markets and commission rates. Management of the Company focuses on several key financial and non financial metrics (as shown in the following table) in evaluating the Companys financial position and operating performance: Growth Rate 1 year 2003 2004 2004 2003 2002 Client Activity Metrics: Net new client assets (in billions) (1) (10%) $ 50.3 $ 56.2 $ 47.6 Client assets (in billions, at year end) 12% $1,081.2 $ 966.7 $ 764.8 Daily average revenue trades (in thousands) 11% 156.4 140.8 134.1 Company Financial Metrics: Revenue growth (decline) from prior year (2) 8% (1%) (3%) Pre tax profit margin (2) 15.3% 18.4% 6.3% Return on stockholders equity 6% 11% 3% Revenue per average full time equivalent employee (in thousands) (2) 10% $ 269 $ 245 $ 214 Revenue on client assets (9%) 42 46 49 (1) Includes an individual outflow of $6.0 billion in 2004 related to a mutual fund clearing client. Includes inflows of $12.1 billion in 2003 at U.S. Trust related to the acquisition of State Street Corporations Private Asset Management group. (2) All amounts have been adjusted to reflect the sale of the Companys capital markets business. o Net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows. Management believes that this metric depicts how well 9 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) the Companys products and services appeal to new and existing clients. o Client assets is the market value of all client assets housed at the Company. Management considers client assets to be indicative of the Companys appeal in the marketplace. Additionally, growth in certain components of client assets (e.g., money market funds) directly impacts asset management and administration fee revenues. o Schwabs daily average revenue trades (DART) is deemed by management to be a key indicator of client engagement with securities markets and the most prominent driver of commission revenues. o Management believes that revenue growth, pre tax profit margin, and return on stockholders equity provide broad indicators of the Companys overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. o Revenue per average full time equivalent employee (revenue per FTE) is considered by management to be the Companys broadest measure of productivity. With the Companys restructuring initiatives over the past four years, revenue per FTE has steadily improved to $269,000 in 2004. o Revenue on client assets is defined as annualized basis points of revenue per dollar of average client assets. Management believes that this metric is a key measure of the Companys ability to broaden the number of services utilized by clients. Restructuring The Company recorded pre tax restructuring charges as follows: 2004 2003 2002 2004 Cost Reduction Effort: Workforce reduction $ 129 Facilities reduction 82 Total 211 2003, 2002, and 2001 Initiatives: Workforce reduction (1) $ 27 $ 140 Facilities reduction 4 49 202 Systems removal 1 Total 3 76 343 Total $ 214 $ 76 $ 343 2004 Cost Reduction Effort In the second quarter of 2004, the Company commenced a firm wide cost reduction effort designed to mitigate the financial impact of its pricing changes (see Results of Operations Financial Overview Revenues Commissions) and to strengthen its productivity and efficiency. The goals of this effort include eliminating work that is not essential to meeting client service standards or the Companys ongoing operating needs, reengineering work processes to maximize productivity, minimizing organizational complexity through functional streamlining, and addressing business unit performance across the Company. During 2004, the Company reallocated certain client service functions from its Orlando regional telephone service center to other centers. The Company also closed or consolidated 111 branch offices, began opening smaller satellite offices in selected locations, and took steps to streamline its technology organization. Additionally, the Company reduced its operating facilities, primarily by exiting certain administrative office space in California. The Company recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $211 million in 2004 related to the 2004 cost reduction effort, primarily reflecting severance costs for approximately 1,600 employees and facilities reduction charges. The Companys 2004 cost reduction effort enabled the firm to steadily reduce its operating expense base throughout 2004, and about $300 million in annualized cost savings were identified and implemented by year end. The Company estimates that its 2004 cost reduction effort will result in approximately $16 million, or $10 million after tax, of restructuring charges in the first quarter of 2005. Estimated additional charges for, or expense savings from, cost reduction efforts to be implemented during 2005 have not yet been determined. 2003, 2002, and 2001 Initiatives The Companys 2003, 2002, and 2001 restructuring initiatives included workforce reductions, reductions in operating facilities, the removal of certain systems hardware, software, and equipment from service, and the withdrawal from certain international operations. These initiatives reduced operating expenses and adjusted the Companys organizational structure to help improve productivity, enhance efficiency, and increase profitability. During 2004, the Company recorded pre tax restructuring charges of $3 million related to its 2003, 2002, and 2001 restructuring initiatives, primarily due to changes in estimates of sublease income associated with previously announced efforts to sublease excess facilities. For further information on the Companys restructuring initiatives, see "Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 3. Restructuring Charges." The actual costs of these restructuring initiatives could differ from the estimated costs, depending primarily on the Companys ability to sublease properties.

Corporate Development Discontinued Operations: On October 29, 2004, the Company completed the sale of its capital markets business to UBS. Pursuant to the purchase agreement, UBS acquired all of the partnership interests of Schwab Capital Markets L.P. and all of the outstanding capital stock of SoundView Technology Group, Inc. (collectively referred to as Schwab Soundview Capital Markets, or SSCM) for $265 million in cash. At closing, the Company and Schwab entered into eight year order routing and execution services agreements with UBS for the handling of Schwabs equity and listed options order flow. SSCM comprised substantially all of the previously reported Capital Markets segment. The results of operations, net of income taxes, and cash flows of SSCM have been presented as discontinued operations on the consolidated statements of income and of cash flows, respectively, and the assets and liabilities of SSCM prior to the sale have each been combined and presented as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the consolidated balance sheet. The Companys consolidated prior period revenues, expenses, taxes on income, assets, liabilities, and cash flows have been adjusted to reflect this presentation. In January 2003, the Company sold its U.K. brokerage subsidiary, Charles Schwab Europe (CSE), to Barclays PLC. The results of operations of CSE, net of income taxes, have been summarized as discontinued operations on the Companys consolidated statement of income. The Companys consolidated prior period revenues, expenses, and taxes on income have been adjusted to reflect this presentation. For further information on the Companys discontinued operations, see "Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 5. Discontinued Operations." Divestiture of Investment: In June 2003, the Company sold its investment in Aitken Campbell, a market making joint venture in the U.K., to the Companys joint venture partner, TD Waterhouse Group, Inc. In 2003, the Company recorded an impairment charge to reduce the carrying value of its investment and an income tax benefit. The Companys share of Aitken Campbells historical earnings, which was accounted for under the equity method, was not material to the Companys results of operations, EPS, or cash flows. For further information, see "Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 6. Business Acquisitions and Divestitures." Sale of Corporate Trust Business: In June 2001, USTC sold its Corporate Trust business to The Bank of New York Company, Inc. The Company recognized an extraordinary gain in 2002 related to this sale, primarily for amounts recognized upon satisfaction of certain client retention requirements. For further information, see "Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 4. Sale of Corporate Trust Business." RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Financial Overview Total revenues were $4.2 billion in 2004, up $306 million, or 8%, from 2003. The Companys non trading revenues totaled $3.2 billion in 2004, up $471 million, or 17%, from 2003. This increase was primarily due to an increase in asset management and administration fees resulting primarily from higher levels of client assets and an increase in net interest revenue resulting primarily from higher levels of and changes in the composition of interest earning assets. Trading revenues totaled $1.0 billion in 2004, down $165 million, or 14%, from 2003. This decrease was primarily due to lower average revenue earned per revenue trade resulting from reductions in the Companys commission pricing, partially offset by higher client trading activity. Total expenses excluding interest for 2004 were $3.6 billion, up $378 million, or 12%, from 2003. This increase was primarily due to a $212 million, or 13%, increase in compensation and benefits expense resulting from higher levels of discretionary bonuses to employees, employee benefits, and incentive compensation, as well as a $138 million, or 182%, increase in restructuring charges. Income from continuing operations before taxes on income and extraordinary gain for 2004 was $645 million, down $72 million, or 10% from 2003, primarily due to the combination of factors discussed above higher compensation and benefits expense and restructuring charges, partially offset by higher levels of non trading revenues. Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, was $128 million for 2004, compared to $4 million for 2003. Net income for 2004 was $286 million, or $.21 per share, down 39% from 2003, primarily due to a higher loss from discontinued operations, net of tax, as well as lower income from continuing operations before taxes on income and extraordinary gain. The Companys after tax profit margin for 2004 was 6.8%, down from 12.1% for 2003. Return on stockholders equity was 6% for 2004, down from 11% in 2003. 11 THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current presentation. All references to earnings per share (EPS) information in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Results of Operations and Financial Condition reflect diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. Segment Information: In evaluating the Companys financial performance, management uses adjusted operating income, a non generally accepted accounting principles (non GAAP) income measure which excludes items described below. Management believes that adjusted operating income is a useful indicator of the ongoing financial performance of the Companys segments, and a tool that can provide meaningful insight into financial performance without the effects of certain material items that are not expected to be an ongoing part of operations (e.g., extraordinary items, non operating revenues, restructuring charges, impairment charges, acquisition and merger related charges, and discontinued operations). In 2004, net income of $286 million included the following items which in total had the effect of decreasing after tax income by $252 million: $133 million of after tax restructuring charges, a $128 million after tax loss from discontinued operations, and a $9 million after tax gain on an investment. In 2003, net income of $472 million included the following items which in total had the effect of decreasing after tax income by $19 million: $48 million of after tax restructuring charges, a $5 million investment write down related to the Companys U.K. market making operation, a $4 million after tax loss from discontinued operations, a $16 million tax benefit associated with the Companys sale of its U.K. market making operation, an $11 million after tax gain on the sale of an investment, and an $11 million tax benefit associated with the Companys merger with U.S. Trust. In 2002, net income of $109 million included the following items which in total had the effect of decreasing after tax income by $304 million: $211 million of after tax restructuring charges, a $52 million after tax loss from discontinued operations, a $37 million investment write down related to the Companys U.K. market making operation, $16 million of after tax acquisition related charges, and a $12 million after tax extraordinary gain on the sale of U.S. Trusts Corporate Trust business.
