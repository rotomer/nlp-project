Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Management of the Company focuses on several key financial and non financial metrics in evaluating the Companys financial position and operating performance. Results for the years ended December 31, 2005, 2004, and 2003 are shown in the following table: Growth Rate1 year 2004 2005 2005 2004 2003 Client Activity Metrics: Net new client assets (in billions) 49 % $ 75.0 $ 50.3 $ 56.2 Client assets (in billions, at year end) 11 % $ 1,199.2 $ 1,081.2 $ 966.7 Daily average revenue trades (in thousands) 27 % 197.9 156.4 140.8 Company Financial Metrics: Revenue growth (decline) from prior year 6 % 8 % (1 %) Pre tax profit margin from continuing operations 26.5 % 15.3 % 18.4 % Return on stockholders equity 16 % 6 % 11 % Revenue per average full time equivalent employee(in thousands) 20 % $ 323 $ 269 $ 245 Net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows. Management believes that this metric depicts how well the Companys products and services appeal to new and existing clients. Client assets is the market value of all client assets housed at the Company. Management considers client assets to be indicative of the Companys appeal in the marketplace. Additionally, growth in certain components of client assets (e.g., Mutual Fund OneSource funds) directly impacts asset management and administration fee revenues. Daily average revenue trades (DART) is deemed by management to be an important indicator of client engagement with securities markets and the most prominent driver of trading revenues. Management believes that revenue growth, pre tax profit margin from continuing operations, and return on stockholders equity provide broad indicators of the Companys overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. Revenue per average full time equivalent employee (revenue per FTE) is considered by management to be the Companys broadest measure of productivity. The Companys revenues are classified into asset based and other (i.e., asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and other revenue) and trading categories. The Company generates asset based and other revenues primarily through asset management and administration fees earned through its proprietary and third party mutual fund offerings, as well as fee based investment management and advisory services, and interest revenue earned on margin loans, loans to banking clients, and investments. Asset based and other revenues are impacted by securities valuations, interest rates, the Companys ability to attract new clients, and client activity levels. The Company generates trading revenues through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenues from trading activity in fixed income securities. Trading revenues are impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of equity prices in the securities markets and commission rates. Energy prices, inflation concerns, and short term interest rates increased throughout 2005. While overall market returns were mixed for much of the year with the Dow Jones Industrial Average ending 1% lower, and the Standard and Poors 500 Index and the Nasdaq Composite Index ending up a modest 3% and 1%, respectively, the Company experienced a general improvement in client asset flows and trading volume as the year progressed. 13 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Following four years of restructuring and cost cutting efforts, management focused on returning to profitable growth in 2005 by enhancing the Companys personal service capabilities and developing stronger relationships with clients. Additionally, reflecting a commitment to deliver a value proposition that includes high quality products and services at competitive prices, the Company significantly reduced its commission pricing for a wide range of clients over the course of the fourth quarter of 2004 and the first three quarters of 2005. Schwab also invested for growth by eliminating account service fees (for most accounts) and order handling fees in the fourth quarter of 2005, as well as launching a significant new national advertising campaign. Assets in client accounts were $1.199 trillion at December 31, 2005, up 11% from 2004. Net new client assets brought to the Company totaled $75.0 billion for the year, up 49% from a year ago. Overall, the Companys price cuts contributed to a 24% decline in trading revenues for 2005, yet continued success in attracting client assets and building stronger client relationships, as well as the rising interest rate environment led to a 16% increase in asset based and other revenues and total revenue growth of 6%. Expenses decreased by 8% over 2004 levels, primarily due to restructuring charges recorded in 2004 related to the Companys restructuring initiatives. The Company achieved a significant increase in its pre tax profit margin from continuing operations due to the combination of higher revenues and lower expenses in 2005. Return on stockholders equity grew in 2005 due to both a 153% increase in net income to $725 million (the highest level in the Companys history) and its capital management activities, including the repurchase of $688 million of common stock. Subsequent Events On January 26, 2006, the Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $300 million of CSCs common stock in addition to the remaining authorization previously granted by the Board of Directors on July 28, 2005. On January 26, 2006, on the recommendation of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, the Board of Directors elected Marjorie Magner to the Board of Directors to serve as a member of the class of directors whose term expires at the annual meeting of stockholders in 2006. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Growth Rate1 year 2004 2005 2005 2004 2003 Asset based and other revenues 16 % $ 3,685 $ 3,177 $ 2,706 Trading revenue (24 %) 779 1,025 1,190 Total revenues 6 % 4,464 4,202 3,896 Expenses excluding interest (8 %) 3,279 3,557 3,179 Income from continuing operations before taxes on income 84 % 1,185 645 717 Taxes on income 97 % (455 ) (231 ) (241 ) Income from continuing operations 76 % 730 414 476 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (96 %) (5 ) (128 ) (4 ) Net income 153 % $ 725 $ 286 $ 472 Earnings per share diluted 162 % $ .55 $ .21 $ .35 Pre tax profit margin from continuing operations 26.5 % 15.3 % 18.4 % Effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations 38.4 % 35.8 % 33.6 % The increase in asset based and other revenues from 2004 was primarily due to an increase in asset management and administration fees resulting from higher levels of client assets and an increase in net interest revenue resulting from yields on assets increasing faster than those on liabilities. The decrease in trading revenues from 2004 was primarily due to lower average revenue earned per revenue trade resulting from reductions in the Companys commission pricing, partially offset by higher client trading activity. 14 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) The decrease in expenses excluding interest from 2004 was primarily due to lower restructuring charges, occupancy and equipment expense, and communications expense. The increase in the effective income tax rate from 2004 was primarily due to higher state taxes in 2005 and a favorable tax settlement in 2004. The increase in income from continuing operations before taxes on income from 2004 was primarily due to the combination of factors discussed above higher asset based and other revenue and lower restructuring charges. The higher income from continuing operations, as well as a lower loss from discontinued operations, resulted in a 153% increase in net income. Effective October 1, 2005, the Company eliminated account service fees (for most accounts) and order handling fees. Based on the Companys then current account base, the impact of these eliminations is approximately $50 million of annualized revenues. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current presentation.
