Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Management of the Company focuses on several key financial and non financial metrics in evaluating the Companys financial position and operating performance. All information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K is presented on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. Results for the years ended December 31, 2006, 2005, and 2004 are shown in the following table: Growth Rate1 year 2005 2006 2006 2005 2004 Client Activity Metrics: Net new client assets (in billions) 4 % $ 72.2 $ 69.5 $ 48.8 Client assets (in billions, at year end) 18 % $ 1,239.2 $ 1,053.5 $ 942.0 Daily average revenue trades (in thousands) 18 % 234.4 197.9 156.4 Company Financial Metrics: Net revenue growth from prior year 19 % 6 % 5 % Pre tax profit margin from continuing operations 34.3 % 28.4 % 16.0 % Return on stockholders equity 26 % 16 % 6 % Net revenue per average full time equivalent employee (in thousands) 13 % $ 362 $ 319 $ 260 Net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows. Management believes that this metric depicts how well the Companys products and services appeal to new and existing clients. Client assets is the market value of all client assets housed at the Company. Management considers client assets to be indicative of the Companys appeal in the marketplace. Additionally, growth in certain components of client assets (e.g., Mutual Fund OneSource funds) directly impacts asset management and administration fee revenues. Daily average revenue trades (DART) is an important indicator of client engagement with securities markets and the most prominent driver of trading revenues. Management believes that net revenue growth, pre tax profit margin from continuing operations, and return on stockholders equity provide broad indicators of the Companys overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. Net revenue per average full time equivalent employee is considered by management to be the Companys broadest measure of productivity. The Companys net revenues are classified into asset based and other (i.e., asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and other revenue) and trading categories. The Company generates asset based and other revenues primarily through asset management and administration fees earned through its proprietary and third party mutual fund offerings, as well as fee based investment management and advisory services, and interest revenue earned on margin loans, loans to banking clients, and investments. Asset based and other revenues are impacted by securities valuations, interest rates, the Companys ability to attract new clients, and client activity levels. The Company generates trading revenues through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenues from trading activity in fixed income securities. Trading revenues are impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of equity prices in the securities markets and commission rates. 15 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) During 2006, interest rates stabilized and the S&P 500 Index and Nasdaq Composite Index marked their fourth consecutive year of gains. Overall market returns for the year showed double digit gains for the three major indices the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 16%, the Standard and Poors 500 Index increased 14%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index increased 10%. Coupled with the strong market returns in 2006, the Company experienced a general improvement in client asset flows and trading volume as the year progressed. The Company strengthened its operating and financial performance in 2006 by focusing on significantly improving the client experience in each of its two segments. Additionally, reflecting a commitment to deliver a value proposition that includes high quality products and services at competitive prices, the Company reduced its commission pricing for a wide range of clients and eliminated certain fees in 2006. Assets in client accounts were $1.239 trillion at December 31, 2006, up 18% from 2005. Net new client assets in the Schwab Investor Services and Schwab Institutional segments totaled $87.3 billion for the year, up 33% from a year ago. Overall, the Companys success in attracting client assets and building stronger client relationships, as well as the interest rate environment and improved market performance, led to a 24% increase in asset based and other revenues and total net revenue growth of 19%. Expenses increased by 9% over 2005 levels, primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense, professional services expense, and advertising and market development expense. The Company achieved an increase in its pre tax profit margin from continuing operations due to revenue growth outpacing expense growth in 2006. Return on stockholders equity grew in 2006 due to both a 69% increase in net income to $1.2 billion (the highest level in the Companys history) and its capital management activities, including the repurchase of $859 million of common stock. Discontinued Operations On November 19, 2006, CSC entered into a definitive agreement with Bank of America pursuant to which Bank of America will acquire all of the outstanding common stock of U.S. Trust for $3.3 billion in cash. The transaction is expected to close early in the third quarter of 2007. However, the closing is subject to (i) approval of new investment advisor agreements for each of the Excelsior&reg; mutual funds by the applicable public fund board and the stockholders of each fund, (ii) regulatory approvals, and (iii) other customary closing conditions. The Company estimates it will record a pre tax gain on the sale of approximately $1.9 billion. After tax proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including share repurchases and continued investment in Schwab Investor Services, Schwab Institutional, and Schwab Bank. U.S. Trust comprised all of the previously reported U.S. Trust segment. In 2006, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $205 million related to the estimated difference between the tax and book bases of the Companys U.S. Trust stock. This amount is included in income from discontinued operations, net of tax on the Companys consolidated statements of income. When calculating the Companys gain on the sale of U.S. Trust for income tax purposes, the tax basis will be the basis of U.S. Trusts prior stockholders in their shares as of the date U.S. Trust was acquired by the Company, since the transaction qualified as a tax free exchange. This tax benefit is managements current estimate and is based on publicly available information, including information on the composition of U.S. Trusts stockholders at the acquisition date and the market price of U.S. Trust stock during relevant periods. The final amount of the basis difference, which could differ from managements estimate, will be determined following a survey of former U.S. Trust stockholders that the Company expects to complete in mid 2007. The results of operations, net of income taxes, and cash flows of U.S. Trust have been presented as discontinued operations on the Companys consolidated statements of income and of cash flows, respectively, and the assets and liabilities of U.S. Trust have been combined and presented as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. The Companys consolidated prior period revenues, expenses, taxes on income, assets, liabilities, and cash flows also reflect this presentation. 16 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) On October 29, 2004, the Company sold its capital markets business to UBS and thereby eliminated the revenues and expenses unique to the capital markets business. The results of operations, net of income taxes, and cash flows of the capital markets business have been presented as discontinued operations on the Companys consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for all periods. 2006 2005 2004 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax: Pending sale of U.S. Trust $ 333 $ 96 $ 64 Sale of capital markets business 3 (5 ) (128 ) Total $ 336 $ 91 $ (64 ) Subsequent Events On January 24, 2007, Christopher V. Dodds, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of CSC, announced his decision to retire as the Chief Financial Officer of CSC on May 18, 2007. The Board of Directors named Joseph R. Martinetto, Senior Vice President and Treasurer of CSC and Schwab, to replace Mr. Dodds as Chief Financial Officer of CSC effective upon Mr. Dodds retirement on May 18, 2007. On February 20, 2007, the Board of Directors appointed Walter W. Bettinger II as President and Chief Operating Officer of CSC. Mr. Bettinger had been serving as Executive Vice President and President Schwab Investor Services. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS Growth Rate1 year 2005 2006 2006 2005 2004 Asset based and other revenues 24 % $ 3,524 $ 2,841 $ 2,393 Trading revenue 1 % 785 778 1,023 Total net revenues 19 % 4,309 3,619 3,416 Expenses excluding interest 9 % 2,833 2,592 2,869 Income from continuing operations before taxes on income 44 % 1,476 1,027 547 Taxes on income 49 % (585 ) (393 ) (197 ) Income from continuing operations 41 % 891 634 350 Income (loss) from discontinued operations, net of tax n/m 336 91 (64 ) Net income 69 % $ 1,227 $ 725 $ 286 Earnings per share diluted 73 % $ .95 $ .55 $ .21 Pre tax profit margin from continuing operations 34.3 % 28.4 % 16.0 % Effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations 39.6 % 38.3 % 36.0 % n/m Not meaningful. The increase in asset based and other revenues from 2005 was primarily due to an increase in asset management and administration fees resulting from higher levels of client assets and an increase in net interest revenue resulting from yields on assets increasing faster than those on liabilities. The increase in trading revenues from 2005 was primarily due to higher client trading activity, partially offset by lower average revenue earned per revenue trade resulting from reductions in the Companys commission pricing, which were effective in the third quarter of 2006. 17 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) The increase in expenses excluding interest from 2005 was primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense, professional services expense, and advertising and market development expense. The increases in the effective income tax rates from 2004 to 2006 were primarily due to higher state taxes. The increase in income from continuing operations before taxes on income from 2005 was primarily due to higher asset based and other revenues. The higher income from continuing operations, combined with the income from discontinued operations, resulted in a 69% increase in net income. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current presentation.
