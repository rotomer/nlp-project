Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Management of the Company focuses on several key financial and non financial metrics in evaluating the Companys financial position and operating performance. All information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K is presented on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. Results for the years ended December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005 are shown in the following table: Growth Rate1 year2006 2007 2007 2006 2005 Client Activity Metrics: Net new client assets (in billions) (1, 2) 92 % $ 160.2 $ 83.3 $ 79.6 Client assets (in billions, at year end) 17 % $ 1,445.5 $ 1,239.2 $ 1,053.5 Clients daily average trades (in thousands) 6 % 284.9 270.0 221.4 Company Financial Metrics: Net revenue growth from prior year 16 % 19 % 6 % Pre tax profit margin from continuing operations 37.1 % 34.3 % 28.4 % Return on stockholders equity 55 % 26 % 16 % Net revenue per average full time equivalent employee(in thousands) 7 % $ 387 $ 362 $ 319 (1) Net new client assets in 2007 includes $23.0 billion related to the acquisition of The 401(k) Company and $3.3 billion related to a mutual fund clearing services client. (2) Effective in 2007, amounts include the Companys mutual fund clearing services business daily net settlements. All prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this change. Net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows. Management believes that this metric depicts how well the Companys products and services appeal to new and existing clients. Client assets is the market value of all client assets housed at the Company. Management considers client assets to be indicative of the Companys appeal in the marketplace. Additionally, growth in certain components of client assets (e.g., Mutual Fund OneSource funds) directly impacts asset management and administration fee revenues. Clients daily average trades is an indicator of client engagement with securities markets and the most prominent driver of trading revenues. Management believes that net revenue growth, pre tax profit margin from continuing operations, and return on stockholders equity provide broad indicators of the Companys overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. Net revenue per average full time equivalent employee is considered by management to be the Companys broadest measure of productivity. The Companys net revenues are classified into asset based and other (i.e., asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and other revenue) and trading categories. The Company generates asset based and other revenues primarily through asset management and administration fees earned through its proprietary and third party mutual fund offerings, as well as fee based investment management and advisory services, and interest revenue earned on margin loans, loans to banking clients, and investments. Asset based and other revenues are impacted by securities valuations, interest rates, the Companys ability to attract new clients, and client activity levels. The Company generates trading revenues through commissions earned for 16 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenues from trading activity in fixed income securities. Trading revenues are impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of equity prices in the securities markets and commission rates. 2007 was marked by increased concerns relating to the housing and credit markets, declining short term interest rates, and significant securities market volatility. Overall equity market returns for the year showed gains for the three major indices the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 6%, the Standard and Poors 500 Index increased 4%, and the Nasdaq Composite Index increased 10%. The Company improved its operating and financial performance in 2007 by focusing on the client experience in each of its three segments and delivering high quality products and services at competitive prices. Net new client assets totaled $160.2 billion for the year, up 92% from a year ago. Assets in client accounts were $1.446 trillion at December 31, 2007, up 17% from 2006. Active brokerage accounts totaled 7.0 million at December 31, 2007, up 5% from 2006. Banking accounts totaled 262,000 at December 31, 2007, up 78% from 2006. Corporate retirement plan participants totaled 1.2 million at December 31, 2007, up 122% from 2006. Net revenues increased by 16% compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in asset management and administration fees driven by growth in client assets, as well as an increase in net interest revenue due to higher interest rate spreads. The Company achieved a pre tax profit margin from continuing operations of 37.1% in 2007 due to revenue growth and disciplined expense management during the year. Return on stockholders equity increased to 55% in 2007, compared to 26% in 2006, reflecting the sale of U.S. Trust, earnings growth, and the Companys continued active management of its capital base. Net revenue per average full time equivalent employee was $387,000 in 2007, up 7% from 2006 due to revenue growth partially offset by the increase in full time equivalent employees as a result of the acquisition of The 401(k) Company in March 2007. Capital Restructuring During 2007, CSC completed a capital restructuring that returned approximately $3.3 billion in capital to stockholders to create a more efficient and cost effective capital structure. The capital restructuring included the following components: CSC paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share, which returned $1.2 billion to stockholders. The special dividend was paid on August 24, 2007, to stockholders of record on July 24, 2007. In August 2007, CSC repurchased 84 million shares of its common stock through a modified Dutch Auction Tender Offer (Tender Offer). The Tender Offer period closed on July 31, 2007 and CSC accepted for purchase 84 million shares of its common stock, at a purchase price of $20.50 per share, for a total purchase price of $1.7 billion. CSC executed a separate Stock Purchase Agreement with Chairman and CEO Charles R. Schwab, CSCs largest stockholder, and with certain additional stockholders whose shares Mr. Schwab is deemed to beneficially own. Under the Stock Purchase Agreement, Mr. Schwab and the other stockholders who are parties to the agreement did not participate in the Tender Offer, but instead, sold, and CSC purchased, 18 million shares, at a purchase price ($20.50 per share), which is the same as was determined and paid in the Tender Offer, for a total purchase price of $369 million. The number of shares repurchased resulted in Mr. Schwab maintaining the same beneficial percentage interest in CSCs outstanding common stock that he had prior to the Tender Offer and sale of shares pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement (approximately 18 percent, which does not take into consideration Mr. Schwabs outstanding options to acquire stock). The shares under this agreement were repurchased on August 15, 2007. In September 2007, CSC issued $250 million of 6.375% Senior Medium Term Notes due in 2017. In October 2007, CSC issued $300 million of junior subordinated notes. For further discussion of the issuance of the junior subordinated notes, see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 12. Borrowings. 17 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Discontinued Operations On July 1, 2007, the Company completed the sale of all of the outstanding common stock of U.S. Trust for $3.3 billion in cash. CSC recognized a gain on the sale of $1.9 billion, or $1.2 billion after tax, in the third quarter of 2007. The results of operations, net of income taxes, and cash flows of U.S. Trust have been presented as discontinued operations on the Companys consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for all periods through the date of the sale. The assets and liabilities of U.S. Trust prior to the sale have each been combined and presented as assets and liabilities of discontinued operations on the Companys consolidated balance sheets. The Companys consolidated prior period revenues, expenses, taxes on income, assets, liabilities, and cash flows also reflect this presentation. In 2004, the Company sold its capital markets business to UBS and thereby eliminated the revenues and expenses unique to the capital markets business. The results of operations, net of income taxes, of the capital markets business have been presented as discontinued operations on the Companys consolidated statements of income for all periods. 2007 2006 2005 Income from discontinued operations, net of tax: Sale of U.S. Trust $ 1,287 $ 333 $ 96 Sale of capital markets business 3 (5 ) Total $ 1,287 $ 336 $ 91 Business Acquisition On March 31, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of The 401(k) Company, which offers retirement plan services, for $115 million in cash. As a result of a purchase price allocation, the Company recorded goodwill of $106 million and intangible assets of $8 million. The intangible assets will be amortized over 16 years. Segment Information The Company provides financial services to individuals, and institutional and corporate clients through three segments Schwab Investor Services, Schwab Institiutional&reg;, and Schwab Corporate and Retirement Services. As a result of organizational and related business changes in the second quarter of 2007, the corporate and retirement services business, which was historically included within the Schwab Investor Services segment, has been separated into its own segment called Schwab Corporate and Retirement Services. Additionally, the mutual fund clearing services business, which was historically included in unallocated and other, is included within the Schwab Corporate and Retirement Services segment. Previously reported segment information has been revised to reflect these changes. The Schwab Investor Services segment includes the Companys retail brokerage and banking operations. The Schwab Institutional segment provides custodial, trading, and support services to independent investment advisors. The Schwab Corporate and Retirement Services segment provides retirement plan services, plan administrator services, stock plan services, and mutual fund clearing services and supports the availability of Schwab proprietary mutual funds on third party platforms. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre tax basis excluding items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges, discontinued operations, and extraordinary items. Segment assets are not disclosed because the balances are not used for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments. 18 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Financial information for the Companys reportable segments is presented in the following table: For the year ended December 31, Growth Rate2006 2007 2007 2006 2005 Schwab Investor Services: Net revenues 14 % $ 3,352 $ 2,940 $ 2,504 Expenses excluding interest 7 % 2,115 1,982 1,805 Contribution margin 29 % $ 1,237 $ 958 $ 699 Schwab Institutional: Net revenues 16 % $ 1,121 $ 966 $ 803 Expenses excluding interest 14 % 639 562 486 Contribution margin 19 % $ 482 $ 404 $ 317 Schwab Corporate and Retirement Services: Net revenues 36 % $ 506 $ 373 $ 294 Expenses excluding interest 37 % 367 268 212 Contribution margin 32 % $ 139 $ 105 $ 82 Unallocated and other: Net revenues N/M $ 15 $ 30 $ 18 Expenses excluding interest N/M 20 21 89 Contribution margin N/M $ (5 ) $ 9 $ (71 ) Total: Net revenues 16 % $ 4,994 $ 4,309 $ 3,619 Expenses excluding interest 11 % 3,141 2,833 2,592 Contribution margin 26 % $ 1,853 $ 1,476 $ 1,027 N/M Not meaningful. Schwab Investor Services Net revenues increased by $412 million, or 14%, from 2006 due to growth in net interest revenue and higher asset management and administration fees. Net interest revenue increased due to higher levels of market interest rates and changes in the composition of interest earning assets, including increases in securities available for sale and loans to banking clients. Asset management and administration fees increased as a result of higher balances of client assets in the Companys proprietary mutual funds and Mutual Fund OneSource&reg; service, as well as balances participating in advisory and managed account service programs. Expenses excluding interest increased by $133 million, or 7%, from 2006 primarily due to higher client servicing and other related expenses, as well as higher market development expense. Schwab Institutional Net revenues increased by $155 million, or 16%, from 2006 due to higher asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue. Asset management and administration fees increased as a result of higher balances of client assets in the Companys proprietary mutual funds and Mutual Fund OneSource&reg; service, as well as balances participating in managed account service programs. Net interest revenue increased due to higher levels of client assets in interest earning products, including increases in securities available for sale. Expenses excluding interest increased by $77 million, or 14%, from 2006 primarily due to higher business development, marketing and account servicing related expenses, as well as increased infrastructure investment. 19 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Schwab Corporate and Retirement Services Net revenues increased by $133 million, or 36%, from 2006 due to higher asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and the acquisition of the 401(k) Company in March 2007. Asset management and administration fees increased as a result of higher mutual fund, advisory, and managed account asset balances. Net interest revenue increased due to higher levels of client assets in interest earning products. Expenses excluding interest increased by $99 million, or 37%, from 2006 primarily due to higher account servicing and related costs as a result of the acquisition of the 401(k) Company and the corresponding increase in the number of corporate retirement plan participants and client assets. Unallocated and Other Net revenues decreased by $15 million, or 50%, from 2006 primarily due to the receipt of $25 million related to the confidential resolution of a legal matter in 2006.

The increases in asset based and other revenues from 2005 to 2007 were primarily due to an increase in asset management and administration fees resulting from higher levels of client assets and an increase in net interest revenue resulting from higher interest rate spreads. Net interest revenue also increased due to the incremental interest revenue generated by temporarily investing the proceeds from the sale of U.S. Trust in the third quarter of 2007. The increase in trading revenues from 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and higher average revenue earned per revenue trade. The increases in expenses excluding interest from 2005 to 2007 were primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense, advertising and market development expense, and professional services expense. The increase in the effective income tax rates on income from continuing operations from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to higher state taxes. The increases in income from continuing operations from 2005 to 2007 were primarily due to an increase in net revenues, partially offset by higher expenses excluding interest. The increase in net income from 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to the gain of $1.2 billion, after tax, on the sale of U.S. Trust in the third quarter of 2007. 20 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current presentation. All references to EPS information in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflect diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. Net Revenues The Company categorizes its revenues as either asset based and other revenues or trading revenue. As shown in the following table, asset based and other revenues, trading revenue, and total net revenues increased from 2006. 21 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Sources of Net Revenues Year Ended December 31, 2007 2006 2005 Growth Rate2006 2007 Amount % ofTotal NetRevenues Amount % ofTotal NetRevenues Amount % ofTotal NetRevenues Asset based and other revenues Asset management and administration fees (1) Mutual fund service fees: Proprietary funds (Schwab Funds&reg;and Laudus Funds&reg;) 21 % $ 1,167 23 % $ 963 22 % $ 825 23 % Mutual Fund OneSource&reg; 21 % 634 13 % 526 12 % 456 13 % Clearing and other 23 % 91 2 % 74 2 % 61 2 % Investment management and trust fees 22 % 378 8 % 310 8 % 228 6 % Other 22 % 88 1 % 72 2 % 104 2 % Asset management and administration fees 21 % 2,358 47 % 1,945 46 % 1,674 46 % Net interest revenue Interest revenue: Margin loans to clients 3 % 859 17 % 837 19 % 654 18 % Investments, client related (15 %) 518 10 % 609 14 % 522 14 % Securities available for sale 25 % 399 8 % 319 8 % 128 4 % Loans to banking clients 32 % 169 3 % 128 3 % 78 2 % Short term investments 123 % 125 3 % 56 2 % 19 1 % Other 22 % 200 5 % 164 3 % 122 3 % Interest revenue 7 % 2,270 46 % 2,113 49 % 1,523 42 % Interest expense: Brokerage client cash balances (23 %) 329 7 % 426 10 % 378 10 % Deposits from banking clients 19 % 238 5 % 200 5 % 74 2 % Long term debt 31 % 38 1 % 29 1 % 30 1 % Other (25 %) 18 24 19 1 % Interest expense (8 %) 623 13 % 679 16 % 501 14 % Net interest revenue 15 % 1,647 33 % 1,434 33 % 1,022 28 % Other (11 %) 129 3 % 145 3 % 145 5 % Total asset based and other revenues 17 % 4,134 83 % 3,524 82 % 2,841 79 % Trading revenue Commissions 7 % 755 15 % 703 16 % 693 19 % Principal transactions 28 % 105 2 % 82 2 % 85 2 % Total trading revenue 10 % 860 17 % 785 18 % 778 21 % Total net revenues 16 % $ 4,994 100 % $ 4,309 100 % $ 3,619 100 % (1) Certain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the 2007 presentation. 22 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Asset Management and Administration Fees Asset management and administration fees include mutual fund service fees, as well as fees for other asset based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. The Company earns mutual fund service fees for transfer agent services, shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third party funds. These fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in third party funds and the Companys proprietary funds. The Company also earns asset management fees for advisory and managed account services, which are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service. The fair values of client assets, which include proprietary and third party mutual funds, are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data. Asset management and administration fees may vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and levels of net new client assets. The increase in asset management and administration fees from 2005 to 2007 was primarily due to higher mutual fund, advisory, and managed account asset balances. The $329 million, or 21% increase in mutual fund service fees from 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to a 26% rise in the Companys proprietary mutual fund asset balances and an 11% increase in asset balances in Schwabs Mutual Fund OneSource service. The $221 million, or 16% increase in mutual fund service fees from 2005 to 2006, was primarily due to a 28% rise in the Companys proprietary mutual fund asset balances and an 18% increase in asset balances in Schwabs Mutual Fund OneSource service. The $68 million, or 22%, and $82 million, or 36%, increase in investment management and trust fees from 2006 to 2007 and 2005 to 2006, respectively, was primarily due to higher balances of client assets participating in advisory and managed account services programs. At December 31, 2007, the Companys total client assets increased $206.3 billion, or 17%, from December 31, 2006 due to $160.2 billion of net new client assets and $46.1 billion of net market gains. At December 31, 2006, the Companys total client assets increased $185.7 billion, or 18%, from December 31, 2005 due to $83.3 billion of net new client assets and $102.4 billion of net market gains. Net Interest Revenue Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on certain assets (mainly margin loans to clients, investments of segregated client cash balances, loans to banking clients, and securities available for sale) and interest paid on supporting liabilities (mainly deposits from banking clients and brokerage client cash balances). Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies. The Company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest earning assets generally reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities). In the event of falling interest rates, the Company might attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock in asset yields as well as by lowering rates paid to clients on interest bearing liabilities. The Companys flexibility in repricing these liabilities is increasingly constrained as short term rates approach zero. In clearing its clients trades, Schwab holds cash balances payable to clients. In most cases, Schwab pays its clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment, and may invest these funds and earn interest revenue. Margin loans arise when Schwab lends funds to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities. Pursuant to SEC regulations, client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients. When investing segregated client cash balances, Schwab must adhere to SEC regulations that restrict investments to U.S. government securities, participation certificates, mortgage backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, certificates of deposit issued by U.S. banks and thrifts, and resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities. Schwabs policies for credit quality and maximum maturity 23 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) requirements are more restrictive than these SEC regulations. Schwab Bank also maintains investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funding from deposits raised in excess of loans to clients. Schwab Bank invests in securities available for sale, including commercial paper, collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs), corporate debt, and U.S. government securities. Schwab Bank lends funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans. These loans are largely funded by interest bearing deposits from banking clients. The Companys interest earning assets are financed primarily by interest bearing brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients. Other funding sources include noninterest bearing brokerage client cash balances, proceeds from stock lending activities, and long term debt, as well as stockholders equity. Client related daily average balances, interest rates, and average net interest spread are summarized as follows: 2007 2006 2005 Interest Earning Assets: Investments of segregated client cash balances: Average balance outstanding $ 9,991 $ 12,758 $ 17,007 Average interest rate 5.18 % 4.77 % 3.07 % Margin loans to clients: Average balance outstanding $ 10,736 $ 10,252 $ 9,780 Average interest rate 8.00 % 8.17 % 6.69 % Securities available for sale: Average balance outstanding (1,2) $ 7,334 $ 6,126 $ 3,376 Average interest rate 5.44 % 5.20 % 3.80 % Loans to banking clients: Average balance outstanding $ 2,786 $ 2,162 $ 1,613 Average interest rate 6.07 % 5.94 % 4.84 % Funding Sources: Interest bearing brokerage client cash balances: Average balance outstanding $ 14,768 $ 17,865 $ 22,037 Average interest rate 2.23 % 2.38 % 1.72 % Interest bearing banking deposits: Average balance outstanding (1) $ 12,047 $ 9,137 $ 5,597 Average interest rate 1.98 % 2.19 % 1.32 % Other interest bearing sources: Average balance outstanding $ 1,961 $ 1,816 $ 1,585 Average interest rate 2.05 % 2.42 % 2.32 % Average noninterest bearing portion $ 2,071 $ 2,480 $ 2,557 Summary: Total average balance on interest earning assets $ 30,847 $ 31,298 $ 31,776 Average yield on interest earning assets 6.30 % 6.05 % 4.35 % Total average balance on funding sources $ 30,847 $ 31,298 $ 31,776 Average interest rate on funding sources 1.97 % 2.14 % 1.54 % Average net interest spread 4.33 % 3.91 % 2.81 % (1) Amounts include assets and liabilities retained from discontinued operations as discussed below. (2) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost. The increases in net interest revenue in the last two years were primarily due to changes in the composition of interest earning assets, including increases in securities available for sale, loans to banking clients, and margin loan balances, as well as generally higher yields on earning assets, partially offset by higher average balances on banking deposits. Since the Company establishes the rates paid on brokerage client cash balances and certain banking deposits and the rates charged on margin loans, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread. However, the spread 24 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition. The Companys average net interest spread increased from 2005 to 2007 as the average yield on interest earning assets increased more than the average interest rate on funding sources. Net interest revenue also increased due to incremental interest revenue generated by temporarily investing the proceeds from the sale of U.S. Trust. The amount of excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts that is swept into money market deposit accounts at Schwab Bank (and at U.S. Trust through May 2007) has increased significantly since the programs inception in 2003. Average interest bearing banking deposits increased $2.9 billion, or 32%, to $12.0 billion from 2006 to 2007, and $3.5 billion, or 63%, to $9.1 billion from 2005 to 2006. Average securities available for sale balances increased $1.2 billion, or 20%, to $7.3 billion from 2006 to 2007, and $2.8 billion, or 81%, to $6.1 billion from 2005 to 2006, with higher levels of investments in corporate debt and mortgage backed securities. Meanwhile, average interest bearing brokerage client cash balances decreased $3.1 billion, or 17%, to $14.8 billion from 2006 to 2007, and $4.2 billion, or 19%, to $17.9 billion from 2005 to 2006. The decline in the average interest bearing brokerage client cash balances led to a corresponding decline of $2.8 billion, or 22%, in average investments of segregated client cash balances to $10.0 billion from 2006 to 2007, and $4.2 billion, or 25%, to $12.8 billion from 2005 to 2006. Certain interest bearing assets and liabilities of U.S. Trust retained by the Company: The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts was previously swept into a money market deposit account at U.S. Trust. In May 2007, Schwab terminated this arrangement and moved all of these balances to a similar existing arrangement with Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2006, these balances totaled $749 million and were included in deposits from banking clients with a corresponding amount in assets retained from discontinued operations on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. The interest expense related to these client deposit balances maintained at U.S. Trust is included in interest expense from continuing operations on the Companys consolidated statements of income of $4 million, $11 million, and $6 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The corresponding interest revenue on the invested cash balances related to these deposits is included in interest revenue from continuing operations on the Companys consolidated statements of income of $14 million, $38 million, and $22 million for 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. The interest revenue amount was calculated using the Companys funds transfer pricing methodology. Other Revenue Other revenue generally includes net gains and losses on certain investments, service fees, and software maintenance fees. Trading Revenue Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenues are affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenues are primarily comprised of revenues from client fixed income securities trading activity. Factors that influence principal transaction revenues include the volume of client trades, market price volatility, and competitive pressures. The increase in trading revenue from 2006 to 2007 was primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and higher average revenue earned per revenue trade. The increase in trading revenue from 2005 to 2006 was primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades, partially offset by lower average revenue earned per revenue trade as a result of reductions in commission pricing in 2006 and 2005. 25 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) As shown in the following table, daily average revenue trades executed by the Company increased 5% in 2007. Average revenue earned per revenue trade increased 4% from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to a higher proportion of equity trading volume outside the Companys active investor programs. Average revenue earned per revenue trade decreased 14% from 2005 to 2006, primarily due to the pricing changes discussed above.

Expenses Excluding Interest As shown in the table below, total expenses excluding interest increased in 2007 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense, advertising and market development expense, and professional services expense.

Incentive compensation is tied to the achievement of specified objectives, including revenue growth, profit margin, and EPS. Therefore, a significant portion of compensation and benefits expense will fluctuate with these measures. 26 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) The increases in compensation and benefits expense from 2005 to 2007 were primarily due to an increase in full time equivalent employees and higher levels of incentive compensation. The following table shows a comparison of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data: Growth Rate2006 2007 2007 2006 2005 Salaries and wages 10 % $ 955 $ 872 $ 842 Incentive compensation (1) 10 % 552 504 389 Employee benefits and other 13 % 274 243 218 Total compensation and benefits expense 10 % $ 1,781 $ 1,619 $ 1,449 Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total net revenues: Salaries and wages 19 % 20 % 23 % Incentive compensation 11 % 12 % 11 % Employee benefits and other 6 % 6 % 6 % Total compensation and benefits expense 36 % 38 % 40 % Full time equivalent employees (in thousands) (2) At year end 7 % 13.3 12.4 11.6 Average 8 % 12.9 11.9 11.3 (1) Includes incentives, discretionary bonus costs, employee stock purchase plan, long term incentive plan, and stock based compensation. (2) Includes full time, part time and temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis, and excludes professional services related to outsourced service providers. The increases in incentive compensation expense from 2005 to 2007 were primarily due to the increased cost of performance based incentive plans as a result of the Companys improved financial results and stock based compensation. For 2007, net revenue growth outpaced compensation and benefits expense growth, resulting in a declining ratio of compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total net revenues. Expenses Excluding Compensation and Benefits The increases in professional services expense from 2005 to 2007 were primarily due to higher levels of fees paid to outsourced service providers and consultants. The increase in occupancy and equipment expense from 2006 to 2007 was due to increases in data processing equipment and maintenance expense of $17 million and occupancy expense of $5 million. The increases in advertising and market development expense from 2005 to 2007 were primarily due to the Companys media and marketing spending related to its Talk to Chuck national advertising campaign during 2006 and 2007. The increase in communications expense from 2006 to 2007 was due to higher levels of postage and printing costs of $15 million and news and quotes services of $5 million. Other expenses increased from 2006 to 2007 primarily due to increases in regulatory fees of $7 million, bank service charges of $7 million, and charitable contributions of $4 million. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CSC conducts substantially all of its business through its wholly owned subsidiaries. The capital structure among CSC and its subsidiaries is designed to provide each entity with capital and liquidity to meet its operational needs and regulatory requirements. On November 15, 2007, Schwab Bank converted its charter from a national association to a federal savings bank. As a result of this conversion, CSC became a savings and loan holding company. As a federal savings bank and 27 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) savings and loan holding company, respectively, Schwab Bank and CSC are both subject to supervision and regulation by the OTS. Prior to the conversion CSC was a financial holding company, which is a type of bank holding company subject to supervision and regulation by the Federal Reserve System (Federal Reserve Board) under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956, as amended, and Schwab Bank was a national association subject to supervision and regulation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. As a savings and loan holding company, CSC is not subject to the consolidated regulatory capital guidelines applicable to a financial holding company. CSC is required to maintain capital that is sufficient to support the holding company and its subsidiaries business activities, and the risks inherent in those activities. To manage capital adequacy, CSC currently utilizes a target Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, as defined by the Federal Reserve Board, of at least 6%. As CSCs depository institution subsidiary, Schwab Bank is required to maintain a capital level that at least equals minimum capital levels specified in federal banking laws and regulations. Failure to meet the minimum levels will result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct effect on the Bank. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2007 and 2006, Schwab Bank is considered well capitalized. Liquidity CSC CSCs liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries, as well as cash provided by external financing. Schwab and Schwab Bank are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with CSC. Management believes that funds generated by the operations of CSCs subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting CSCs liquidity needs, providing adequate liquidity to meet Schwab Banks capital guidelines, and maintaining Schwabs net capital. CSC has liquidity needs that arise from its Senior Medium Term Notes, Series A (Medium Term Notes), as well as from the funding of cash dividends, acquisitions, and other investments. In September 2007, CSC issued $250 million of 6.375% Medium Term Notes due in 2017. The Medium Term Notes, of which $473 million was outstanding at December 31, 2007, have maturities ranging from 2008 to 2017 and fixed interest rates ranging from 6.38% to 8.05% with interest payable semiannually. The Medium Term Notes are rated A2 by Moodys Investors Service (Moodys), A by Standard & Poors Ratings Group (S&P), and A by Fitch IBCA, Inc. (Fitch). CSC has a prospectus supplement on file with the SEC enabling CSC to issue up to $750 million in Senior or Senior Subordinated Medium Term Notes, Series A. At December 31, 2007, $500 million of these notes remained unissued. CSC has a Registration Statement under the Securities Act of 1933 on Form S 3 on file with the SEC relating to a universal shelf registration for the issuance of up to $1.0 billion aggregate amount of various securities, including common stock, preferred stock, debt securities, and warrants. At December 31, 2007, $700 million of these securities remained unissued. In October 2007, CSC issued $300 million of junior subordinated notes. See Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 12. Borrowings for a discussion of the junior subordinated notes issued under this registration statement. CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue commercial paper up to the amount of CSCs committed, unsecured credit facility (see below), not to exceed $1.5 billion. At December 31, 2007, no commercial paper had been issued. CSCs ratings for these short term borrowings are P 1 by Moodys, A 1 by S&P, and F1 by Fitch. CSC maintains an $800 million committed, unsecured credit facility with a group of eighteen banks which is scheduled to expire in June 2008. CSC plans to establish a similar facility to replace this one when it expires. This facility was unused in 2007. Any issuances under CSCs commercial paper program will reduce the amount 28 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) available under this facility. The funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes and CSC pays a commitment fee on the unused balance of this facility. The financial covenants in this facility require CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders equity, Schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, as defined, and Schwab Bank to be well capitalized, as defined. Management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on its ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements. CSC also has direct access to $811 million of the $861 million uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines, provided by eight banks, that are primarily utilized by Schwab to manage short term liquidity. The amount available to CSC under these lines is lower than the amount available to Schwab because the credit line provided by one of these banks is only available to Schwab. These lines were not used by CSC in 2007. In addition, Schwab provides CSC with a $1.0 billion credit facility maturing in 2009. No funds were drawn under this facility at December 31, 2007. Schwab Most of Schwabs assets are readily convertible to cash, consisting primarily of short term (i.e., less than 150 days) investment grade, interest earning investments (the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements), receivables from brokerage clients, and receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. Client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities. Receivables from and payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions, which usually settle, or can be closed out, within a few business days. Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which were $19.5 billion, $19.9 billion, and $24.2 billion at December 31, 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for Schwab in the future. The Company has a lease financing liability related to an office building and land under a 20 year lease. The remaining lease financing liability of $121 million at December 31, 2007 is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term of approximately 17 years. To manage short term liquidity, Schwab maintains uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with a group of eight banks totaling $861 million at December 31, 2007. The need for short term borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest bearing investments, and movements of cash to meet segregation requirements. Schwab used such borrowings for seventeen days in 2007, with daily amounts borrowed averaging $177 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2007. To satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), Schwab has unsecured letter of credit agreements with twelve banks in favor of the OCC aggregating $1.1 billion at December 31, 2007. Schwab pays a fee to maintain these arrangements. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. Schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by arranging letters of credit (LOCs), in favor of these brokerage clients, which are issued by multiple banks. Schwab also pays a fee to maintain these arrangements. At December 31, 2007, the aggregate face amount of these outstanding LOCs totaled $195 million. No funds were drawn under these LOCs at December 31, 2007. Schwab is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers. These regulations prohibit Schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings to CSC, paying cash dividends, or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent or employees if such payment would result in net capital of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar 29 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) requirement of $250,000. At December 31, 2007, Schwabs net capital was $1.2 billion (10% of aggregate debit balances), which was $990 million in excess of its minimum required net capital and $613 million in excess of 5% of aggregate debit balances. To manage Schwabs regulatory capital requirement, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.4 billion subordinated revolving credit facility which is scheduled to expire in March 2008. Schwab plans to renew this facility when it expires. The amount outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2007 was $220 million. Borrowings under this subordinated lending arrangement qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. In addition, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.0 billion credit facility maturing in 2009. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. No funds were drawn under this facility at December 31, 2007. Schwab Bank Schwab Banks current liquidity needs are generally met through deposits from banking clients and equity capital. The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts is swept into a money market deposit account at Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2007, these balances totaled $12.2 billion. Schwab Bank has access to traditional funding sources such as deposits, federal funds purchased, and repurchase agreements. Additionally, CSC provides Schwab Bank with a $100 million short term credit facility maturing in December 31, 2009. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab Bank. No funds were drawn under this facility at December 31, 2007. Schwab Bank maintains a credit facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLB). At December 31, 2007, $631 million was available, and no funds were drawn under this facility. Capital Resources The Company monitors both the relative composition and absolute level of its capital structure. Management is focused on limiting the Companys use of capital and currently targets a long term debt to total financial capital ratio of less than 30%. The Companys total financial capital (long term debt plus stockholders equity) at December 31, 2007 was $4.6 billion, down $765 million from December 31, 2006. The decline in the Companys total financial capital was primarily due to the repurchase of shares under the Tender Offer and Stock Purchase Agreement with Mr. Schwab and certain additional stockholders and the $1.00 per common share special dividend paid in August 2007. The decline was offset by the issuance of $250 million of senior medium term notes and $300 million of junior subordinated notes, and the gain realized on the sale of U.S. Trust during 2007. At December 31, 2007, the Company had long term debt of $899 million, or 19% of total financial capital, that bears interest at a weighted average rate of 7.01%. At December 31, 2006, the Company had long term debt of $388 million, or 7% of total financial capital. The Company repaid $43 million and $68 million of long term debt in 2007 and 2006, respectively. The Companys cash position (reported as cash and cash equivalents on the Companys consolidated balance sheet) and cash flows are affected by changes in brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under federal or other regulatory guidelines. Timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that date may arise in the ordinary course of business and are addressed by the Company in accordance with applicable regulations. Other factors which affect the Companys cash position and cash flows include investment activity in securities, levels of capital expenditures, acquisition and divestiture activity, banking client deposit activity, brokerage and banking client loan activity, financing activity in long term debt, payments of dividends, and repurchases of CSCs 30 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) common stock. The combination of these factors can cause significant fluctuations in the levels of cash and cash equivalents during specific time periods. Capital Expenditures In 2007, the Companys capital expenditures, net, were $168 million. In 2006, the Companys capital expenditures were $122 million and the Company sold $63 million of fixed assets, which primarily consisted of a data center. Capital expenditures, net, as a percentage of net revenues totaled 3% and 1% in 2007 and 2006, respectively. In 2007 and 2006, capital expenditures were primarily for software and equipment relating to the Companys information technology systems. Capital expenditures include capitalized costs for developing internal use software of $57 million in 2007 and $42 million in 2006. Management currently anticipates that 2008 capital expenditures will be approximately 10% higher than 2007 spending, primarily due to increased spending on leasehold improvements and assets relating to the Companys information technology systems. As has been the case in recent years, the Company may adjust its capital expenditures from period to period as business conditions change. Management believes that funds generated by its operations will continue to be the primary funding source of its capital expenditures. Dividends CSC paid common stock cash dividends of $1.5 billion in 2007, which included a special cash dividend of $1.2 billion. CSC paid common stock cash dividends of $173 million in 2006. Since the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 75 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend 18 times, including a 20% and 67% increase in the second and fourth quarters of 2006, respectively. Since 1989, dividends have increased by a 29% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. CSC paid common stock dividends of $1.200, $.135, and $.089 per share in 2007, 2006, and 2005, respectively. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, the Company currently targets its cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income. Share Repurchases In 2007, CSC repurchased 135 million shares of its common stock, including shares repurchased under the Tender Offer and Stock Purchase Agreement described below for $2.7 billion. CSC repurchased 52 million shares of its common stock for $859 million in 2006. As of December 31, 2007, CSC had authority to repurchase up to $446 million of its common stock under prior authorization by the Board of Directors. On July 31, 2007, CSC completed a share repurchase through a Tender Offer. CSC accepted for purchase 84 million shares of its common stock at a price of $20.50 per share, for a total purchase price of $1.7 billion. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, CSC was prohibited from making open market repurchases of its common stock during the Tender Offer period and until August 15, 2007. Under the Stock Purchase Agreement executed on July 2, 2007 with Chairman and CEO Charles R. Schwab, CSCs largest stockholder, and with certain additional stockholders whose shares Mr. Schwab is deemed to beneficially own, CSC purchased 18 million shares at a price of $20.50 per share for a total of $369 million on August 15, 2007. 31 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Acquisition and Divestiture On July 1, 2007, the Company completed the sale of U.S. Trust to Bank of America and received proceeds of $3.3 billion. On March 31, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of The 401(k) Company for $115 million in cash. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company enters into various off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of its clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, the Company enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 19. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. Contractual Obligations A summary of the Companys principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2007 is shown in the following table. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet that are generally short term in nature (e.g., drafts payable) or without contractual payment terms (e.g., deposits from banking clients, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation). Management believes that funds generated by its continuing operations, as well as cash provided by external financing, will continue to be the primary funding sources in meeting these obligations.

RISK MANAGEMENT Overview The Companys business activities expose it to a variety of risks including technology and operations risk, credit, market and liquidity risks, and legal and reputational risk. Identification and management of these risks are essential to the success and financial soundness of the Company. Senior management takes an active role in the Companys risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling various risks. Oversight of risk management has been delegated to the Global Risk Committee, which 32 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) is comprised of senior managers of major business and control functions. The Global Risk Committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Companys risk exposures, and leading the continued development of the Companys risk management policies and practices. Functional risk sub committees focusing on specific areas of risk report into the Global Risk Committee. These sub committees include: Corporate Asset Liability Management and Pricing Committee, which focuses on the Companys liquidity, capital resources, and interest rate risk; Credit and Market Risk Oversight Committee, which focuses on the credit exposures resulting from client activity (e.g., margin lending activities and loans to banking clients), the investing activities of certain of the Companys proprietary funds, corporate credit activities (e.g., counterparty and corporate investing activities), and market risk resulting from the Company taking positions in certain securities to facilitate client trading activity; Technology and Operations Risk Committee, which focuses on the integrity of controls and operating capacity of the Companys systems and operations processes; Fiduciary Risk Committee, which oversees activities of the Company with a fiduciary component; New Products Committee, which addresses risks associated with new products and services; and Information Security and Privacy Steering Committee, which oversees information security and privacy programs and policies. The Global Risk Committee reports regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee), which reviews major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Companys Disclosure Committee is responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys (a) disclosure controls and procedures and (b) internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Additionally, the Companys compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and risk and credit management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring the Companys risk management. Risk is inherent in the Companys business. Consequently, despite the Companys efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage risk, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses due to operating or other risks. The following discussion highlights the Companys policies and procedures for identification, assessment, and management of the principal areas of risk in its operations. Technology and Operating Risk Technology and operating risk is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems that constrain the Companys ability to gather, process and communicate information and process client transactions efficiently and securely, without interruptions. The Companys operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the Companys success depends, in part, on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs. To the extent the Company experiences system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to its systems, linkages with third party systems, and power failures), the Companys business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted. Additionally, rapid increases in client demand may strain the Companys ability to enhance its technology and expand its operating capacity. To minimize business interruptions, Schwab has two data centers intended, in part, to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency. The Company is committed to an 33 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) ongoing process of upgrading, enhancing, and testing its technology systems. This effort is focused on meeting client needs, meeting market and regulatory changes, and deploying standardized technology platforms. Technology and operating risk also includes the risk of human error, employee misconduct, external fraud, computer viruses, terrorist attack, and natural disaster. Employee misconduct could include fraud and misappropriation of client or Company assets, improper use or disclosure of confidential client or Company information, and unauthorized activities, such as transactions exceeding acceptable risks or authorized limits. External fraud includes misappropriation of client or Company assets by third parties, including through unauthorized access to Company systems and data and client accounts. The frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase. The Company has specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and uses periodic risk self assessments and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The Company maintains backup and recovery functions, including facilities for backup and communications, and conducts periodic testing of disaster recovery plans. The Company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data. Despite the Companys risk management efforts, it is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure, or fraud or other misconduct, and the precautions taken by the Company may not be effective in all cases. The Company may be subject to litigation, losses, and regulatory actions in such cases, and may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. The Company also faces technology and operating risk when it employs the services of various external vendors, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, and support functions. The Company manages its exposure to such outsourcing risks through contractual provisions, control standards, and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance. The Company maintains policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with Company data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non public client information. The Company clearly defines for employees, contractors, and vendors the Companys expected standards of care for confidential data. Regular training is provided by the Company in regard to data security. The Company is actively engaged in the research and development of new technologies, services, and products. The Company endeavors to protect its research and development efforts, and its brands, through the use of copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and contracts. Credit Risk Credit risk is the potential for loss due to a client or counterparty failing to perform its contractual obligations, or the value of collateral held to secure obligations proving to be inadequate. The Companys direct exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending activities, securities lending activities, mortgage lending activities, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds that the Company sponsors. To manage the risks of such losses, the Company has established policies and procedures which include: establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin requirements for certain securities. In addition, most of the Companys credit extensions, such as margin loans to clients, securities lending agreements, and resale agreements, are supported by collateral arrangements. These arrangements are subject to requirements to provide additional collateral in the event that market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received. Additionally, the Company has exposure to credit risk associated with the Companys banking loan portfolios held at Schwab Bank. This client credit exposure is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews performed by management. Management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations, delinquencies, 34 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) non performing loans to banking clients, losses, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses, which is reviewed quarterly by senior management. The Companys loans to banking client portfolios primarily include first lien 3 , 5 and 7 year adjustable rate mortgage loans (First Mortgage portfolio) of $2.1 billion and home equity lines of credit (HELOC portfolio) of $1.2 billion at December 31, 2007. The Company does not offer loans that allow for negative amortization. The Company maintains credit underwriting standards that have limited the exposure to the types of loans that experienced high foreclosures and loss rates elsewhere in 2007. The Company does not originate or purchase sub prime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a Fair Isaac & Company (FICO) credit score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. At December 31, 2007, approximately 1% of both the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios consisted of loans to borrowers with FICO credit scores of less than 620. The Company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale portfolio. This portfolio includes U.S. agency and non agency CMOs, corporate debt securities, long term certificates of deposit and U.S. agency notes. The securities available for sale portfolio totaled $7.5 billion as of December 31, 2007. U.S. agency CMOs do not have explicit credit ratings, however management considers these to be rated AAA (defined as a rating equivalent to a Moodys rating of Aaa or a Standard and Poors rating of AAA) based on the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. agencies. At December 31, 2007, the corporate debt securities were not rated lower than investment grade (defined as a rating equivalent to a Moodys rating of Baa or higher, or a Standard and Poors rating of BBB or higher). Schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwabs client or a counterparty fails to meet its obligations to Schwab. Concentration Risk The Company is subject to concentration risk when holding large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry. The Companys investments in mortgage backed securities including CMOs totaled $6.4 billion at December 31, 2007. Of these, $2.9 billion were U.S. agency securities. The mortgage backed securities portfolio also includes $768 million of CMOs in which the underlying loans are considered Alt A (defined as loans with reduced documentation at origination) and were rated AAA. The Companys investments in corporate debt securities totaled $784 million at December 31, 2007, with the majority issued by institutions in the financial services industry. The Companys balance of loans to banking clients, net, totaled $3.4 billion at December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2007, approximately 80% of the First Mortgage portfolio consisted of loans with interest only payment terms. At December 31, 2007, the interest rates on approximately 80% of these interest only loans are not scheduled to reset for 3 or more years. At December 31, 2007, 31% of the residential real estate mortgages and 45% of the home equity lines of credit balances were secured by properties which are located in California. The Company is also subject to concentration risk from its margin and securities lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or industry. The Company is subject to indirect exposure to U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral to secure its resale agreements. The Companys primary credit exposure on these resale transactions is with its counterparty. The Company would have exposure to the U.S. Government and agency securities only in the event of the counterpartys default on the resale agreements. U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral for resale agreements at December 31, 2007 totaled $2.8 billion. 35 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Fiduciary Risk Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. The Company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various fiduciary risk committees. Legal and Regulatory Risk The Company faces significant legal and compliance risk in its business, and the volume of litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed have been increasing. Among other things, these risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for Company products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of the Companys controls. Claims against the Company may increase due to a variety of factors, such as if clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions, as the Company increases the level of advice it provides to clients, and as the Company enhances the services it provides to IAs. In addition, the Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, and SROs, and such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex. The Company attempts to manage legal and compliance risk through policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid litigation claims and prevent or detect violations of applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti money laundering, client privacy, employment policies, and contracts management. Despite the Companys efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls, legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm, significant losses and disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the Companys business activities. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While the majority of the Companys revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the Companys financial position and reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Companys financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. Other than Temporary Impairment of Securities Available for Sale: The Company evaluates the determination of other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. The determination of whether or not other than temporary impairment exists is a matter of judgment. The evaluation includes the assessment of several factors including: 1) whether the unrealized loss is solely due to changes in interest rates or changes in the credit standing of the issuer, 2) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost, 3) the financial condition of the issuer, 4) the credit ratings of the issuer or security, 5) the collateral underlying the security, and 6) the Companys intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. If the Company determines other than temporary impairment exists, the cost basis of the security is adjusted to the then current fair value, with a corresponding loss recognized in current earnings. If future evaluations conclude that an impairment now considered to be temporary is other than temporary, the Company would recognize a realized loss through earnings at that time. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the 36 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) Companys gross unrealized losses on securities available for sale were $60 million and $28 million, respectively. The Companys total securities available for sale at December 31, 2007 and 2006 were $7.5 billion and $6.0 billion, respectively. Income Tax Benefit Related to the Sale of U.S. Trust: In 2006, the Company recorded a $205 million income tax benefit related to the estimated difference between the tax and book bases of the Companys U.S. Trust stock. This amount was included in income from discontinued operations, net of tax, on the Companys consolidated statements of income. This initial estimate of the tax benefit was based on publicly available information, including information on the composition of U.S. Trusts stockholders at the acquisition date and the market price of U.S. Trust stock during relevant periods, and was subject to adjustment following a survey of former U.S. Trust stockholders. Based upon results of this survey, the Company recorded an additional $72 million income tax benefit in 2007. This tax benefit estimate is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. Valuation of Goodwill: Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually, or whenever indications of impairment exist. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess. The Company has elected April 1 as its annual goodwill impairment testing date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on April 1, 2007, management estimated the fair value of each of the Companys reporting units (generally defined as the Companys businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and compared this value to the carrying value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit was greater than its carrying value, and therefore management concluded that no amount of goodwill was impaired. The estimated fair value of the reporting units was established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit. Adverse changes in the Companys planned business operations such as unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit, or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the Companys recorded goodwill. The Companys goodwill balance was $525 million and $419 million at December 31, 2007 and 2006, respectively. Allowance for Credit Losses: The Company regularly evaluates its portfolio of loans to banking clients and provides allowances for the portion management believes may be uncollectible. Several factors are taken into consideration in this evaluation including current economic conditions, the composition of the loan portfolio, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. For Schwab Banks portfolio, which primarily consists of mortgage loans, a risk based methodology is used to determine the allowance for credit losses. Mortgage loans are categorized into portfolios by loan type and risk characteristics. A probable loss rate, based on company and industry experience, is used to determine the credit allowance. At December 31, 2007 and 2006, the Companys allowance for credit losses was $7 million and $4 million on loan portfolios of $3.5 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively. Legal Reserve: Reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, insurance coverage and indemnification, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. The Companys management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Companys 37 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, and as Noted) significant estimates discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
