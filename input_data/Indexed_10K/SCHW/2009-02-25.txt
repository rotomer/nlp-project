Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Management of the Company focuses on several key financial and non financial metrics in evaluating the Companys financial position and operating performance. All information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K is presented on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. Results for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006 are shown in the following table: Growth Rate1 year2007 2008 2008 2007 2006 Client Activity Metrics: Net new client assets (in billions) (1, 2) (29 %) $ 113.4 $ 160.2 $ 83.3 Client assets (in billions, at year end) (21 %) $ 1,137.0 $ 1,445.5 $ 1,239.2 Clients daily average trades (in thousands) 22 % 346.6 284.9 270.0 Company Financial Metrics: Net revenues 3 % $ 5,150 $ 4,994 $ 4,309 Expenses excluding interest (1 %) 3,122 3,141 2,833 Income from continuing operations before taxes on income 9 % 2,028 1,853 1,476 Taxes on income 9 % (798 ) (733 ) (585 ) Income from continuing operations 10 % 1,230 1,120 891 (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax N/M (18 ) 1,287 336 Net income N/M $ 1,212 $ 2,407 $ 1,227 Earnings per share from continuing operations diluted 15 % $ 1.06 $ .92 $ .69 Earnings per share diluted N/M $ 1.05 $ 1.97 $ .95 Net revenue growth from prior year 3 % 16 % 19 % Pre tax profit margin from continuing operations 39.4 % 37.1 % 34.3 % Return on stockholders equity 31 % 55 % 26 % Net revenue per average full time equivalent employee (in thousands) (1 %) $ 383 $ 387 $ 362 (1) Net new client assets in 2007 includes $23.0 billion related to the acquisition of The 401(k) Company and $3.3 billion related to a mutual fund clearing services client. (2) Effective in 2007, amounts include the Companys mutual fund clearing services business daily net settlements. All prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this change. N/M Not meaningful. Net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows. Management believes that this metric depicts how well the Companys products and services appeal to new and existing clients. Client assets is the market value of all client assets housed at the Company. Management considers client assets to be indicative of the Companys appeal in the marketplace. Additionally, fluctuations in certain components of client assets (e.g., Mutual Fund OneSource funds) directly impacts asset management and administration fee revenues. Clients daily average trades is an indicator of client engagement with securities markets and the most prominent driver of trading revenues. Management believes that net revenue growth, pre tax profit margin from continuing operations, and return on stockholders equity provide broad indicators of the Companys overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns. 15 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Net revenue per average full time equivalent employee is considered by management to be the Companys broadest measure of productivity. The Companys major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. The Company generates asset management and administration fees through its proprietary and third party mutual fund offerings, as well as fee based investment management and advisory services. Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue are impacted by securities valuations, interest rates, the Companys ability to attract new clients, and client activity levels. The Company generates trading revenues through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenues from trading activity in fixed income securities. Trading revenues are impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of equity prices in the securities markets and commission rates. 2008 Compared to 2007 2008 was marked by extraordinary market conditions, including continued downward pressure on home prices, tighter credit markets, liquidity concerns, significant volatility and sharp declines in the equity markets, and continued slowing of general economic activity. The Nasdaq Composite Index, Standard and Poors 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased during the year by 41%, 38%, and 34%, respectively, with a significant portion of these decreases occurring in the fourth quarter. In addition, the federal funds rate decreased during the year by 4.25% to a range of zero to 0.25% at December 31, 2008. Even with this unprecedented market environment, clients remained actively engaged with the Company in managing their investments and made heavy use of all of the Companys service channels branch, phone, and internet. Net new client assets totaled $113.4 billion for the year, down 29% from a year ago, reflecting continued deterioration in the equity markets and lower asset valuations. Total client assets were $1.137 trillion at December 31, 2008, down 21% from December 31, 2007. Additionally, clients daily average trades increased 22% to 346,600 in 2008 from 2007. Net revenues grew by 3% in 2008 from the prior year primarily due to an increase in trading revenue partially offset by a decrease in other revenue. Trading revenue increased in 2008 primarily due to higher trading volume as a result of significant volatility in the equity markets during the year. The decrease in other revenue in 2008 related to losses of $75 million on investments in the Companys securities available for sale portfolio. Asset management and administration fees remained relatively flat in 2008 reflecting the Companys ability to attract and retain clients. Net interest revenue increased by 1% in 2008 due to higher levels of interest earning assets offset by the impact of a decrease in the average net yield earned on these assets. Although expenses excluding interest remained relatively flat in 2008, compensation and benefits expense decreased reflecting lower incentive compensation, while other expense and occupancy and equipment expense increased. The loss from discontinued operations of $18 million in 2008 relates to the adjustment to finalize the income tax gain related to the sale of U.S. Trust. As a result of the Companys sustained expense discipline in 2008, the Company achieved a pre tax profit margin from continuing operations of 39.4% and return on stockholders equity of 31% in 2008. Return on stockholders equity in 2007 included a $1.2 billion after tax gain on the sale of U.S. Trust, as well as incremental interest revenue generated from temporarily investing the proceeds from the sale. Net revenue per average full time equivalent employee was $383,000 in 2008, down 1% from 2007 as net revenue growth was lower than the increase in average full time equivalent employees. 2007 Compared to 2006 Overall equity market returns for 2007 showed gains for the three major indices the Nasdaq Composite Index increased by 10%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 6%, and the Standard and Poors 500 Index increased 4%. Net new client assets totaled $160.2 billion for 2007, up 92% from 2006, which included $23.0 billion related to the acquisition of The 401(k) Company in 2007. Total client assets were $1.446 trillion at December 31, 2007, up 17% from December 31, 2006. Clients daily average trades increased 6% to 284,900 in 2007 from 2006. 16 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Net revenues grew by 16% in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to an increase in asset management and administration fees driven by growth in client assets, as well as an increase in net interest revenue due to higher interest rate spreads. Expenses excluding interest increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense, advertising and market development expense, and professional services expense. The Companys pre tax profit margin from continuing operations was 37.1% in 2007 as compared to 34.3% in 2006 due to revenue growth and disciplined expense management during the year. Return on stockholders equity increased to 55% in 2007 as compared to 26% in 2006, reflecting the sale of U.S. Trust, earnings growth, and the Companys active management of its capital base. Net revenue per average full time equivalent employee was $387,000 in 2007, up 7% from 2006 due to revenue growth partially offset by the increase in average full time equivalent employees as a result of the acquisition of The 401(k) Company. Certain reclassifications have been made to prior year amounts to conform to the current presentation. All references to EPS information in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflect diluted earnings per share unless otherwise noted. CURRENT MARKET ENVIRONMENT The adverse market conditions in 2008 discussed above continue to negatively impact the Companys revenues. The Company earns mutual fund service fees and asset management fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets. Fluctuations in these client asset balances caused by changes in equity valuations directly impact the amount of fee revenue earned by the Company. Continued depressed equity valuations in 2009 will negatively impact asset management and administration fees on a year over year basis. Additionally, mutual fund service fees may be further reduced if the current interest rate environment persists. To the extent certain money market mutual funds replace maturing securities with lower yielding securities and the overall yield on such funds falls to a level at or below the management fees on those funds, the Company may waive a portion of its fee in order to continue providing some return to clients. With the recent decline in interest rates, the Companys revenue from interest earning assets such as securities held and loans to clients has been declining more than the rates that the Company pays on funding sources such as customer deposits. The Companys ability to reduce those rates has been limited as short term rates have approached zero. If the current interest rate environment persists through 2009, it will negatively impact net interest revenue on a year over year basis. The level at which clients utilize margin loans will also impact net interest revenue. While the average balance of margin loans was $10.3 billion for all of 2008, by month end December the balance had declined to $6.2 billion. The Company recorded pre tax losses of $75 million related to two corporate debt securities in its securities available for sale portfolio in 2008. Certain securities available for sale experienced deteriorating credit characteristics in 2008. Further deterioration in the performance of these securities, including non agency mortgage backed securities, could result in the recognition of future impairment charges. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion presents an analysis of the Companys results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006. 17 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Net Revenues The Companys major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. Asset management and administration fees were relatively flat, while net interest revenue and trading revenue increased in 2008 as compared to 2007. Asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue increased in 2007 as compared to 2006.

Asset Management and Administration Fees Asset management and administration fees include mutual fund service fees and fees for other asset based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. The Company earns mutual fund service fees for transfer agent services, shareholder services, administration, and investment management provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third party funds. These fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in third party funds and the Companys proprietary funds. The Company also earns asset management fees for advisory and managed account services, which are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service. The fair values of client assets, which include proprietary and third party mutual funds, are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data. Asset management and administration fees may vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and levels of net new client assets. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees, see Current Market Environment. Asset management and administration fees remained relatively flat in 2008 from 2007, primarily due to lower third party mutual fund and advisory service fees, partially offset by higher proprietary fund fees. Mutual Fund OneSource service fees decreased by $77 million, or 12%, in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to a 39% decline in Schwabs Mutual Fund OneSource asset balances. The Companys proprietary mutual fund service fees increased $98 million, or 8%, in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to a 15% increase in money market mutual fund asset balances. Investment management and trust fees decreased by $38 million, or 10%, in 2008 from 2007 due to lower balances of client assets participating in advisory and managed account services programs. Asset management and administration fees increased by $413 million, or 21%, in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to higher mutual fund, advisory, and managed account asset balances. Mutual fund service fees increased $329 million, or 21% in 2007 18 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) from 2006 primarily due to a 26% rise in the Companys proprietary mutual fund asset balances and an 11% increase in asset balances in Schwabs Mutual Fund OneSource service. Investment management and trust fees increased by $68 million, or 22%, in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to higher balances of client assets participating in advisory and managed account services programs. Net Interest Revenue Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies. The Company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest earning assets generally reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities). In the event of falling interest rates, the Company might attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock in asset yields as well as by lowering rates paid to clients on interest bearing liabilities. Since the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients, as well as the rates charged on receivables from brokerage clients, and also controls the composition of its investment securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread. However, the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on net interest revenue, see Current Market Environment. In clearing its clients trades, Schwab holds cash balances payable to clients. In most cases, Schwab pays its clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment, and may invest these funds and earn interest revenue. Receivables from brokerage clients consist primarily of margin loans to brokerage clients. Margin loans are loans made by Schwab to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities. Pursuant to SEC regulations, client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients. When investing segregated client cash balances, Schwab must adhere to SEC regulations that restrict investments to securities guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, participation certificates, mortgage backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, certificates of deposit issued by U.S. banks and thrifts, and resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities. Additionally, Schwab has established policies for the minimum credit quality and maximum maturity of these investments. Schwab Bank also maintains investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funding from deposits raised in excess of loans to banking clients. Schwab Banks securities available for sale include mortgage backed securities, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, asset backed securities, and U.S. agency notes. Schwab Banks securities held to maturity include asset backed securities. Schwab Bank lends funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans. These loans are largely funded by interest bearing deposits from banking clients. The Companys interest earning assets are financed primarily by brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients. Other funding sources include noninterest bearing brokerage client cash balances and proceeds from stock lending activities, as well as stockholders equity. The amount of excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts that is swept into money market deposit accounts at Schwab Bank and (through May 2007) at U.S. Trust has increased significantly since the programs inception in 2003. Average interest bearing banking deposits increased $7.2 billion, or 59%, to $19.2 billion in 2008 from 2007, and $2.9 billion, or 32%, to $12.0 billion in 2007 from 2006. As a result, the average securities available for sale balances increased $4.4 billion, or 60%, to $11.8 billion in 2008 from 2007, and $1.2 billion, or 20%, to $7.3 billion in 2007 from 2006, while the average balance of loans to banking clients increased $2.0 billion, or 73%, to $4.8 billion in 2008 from 2007, and $629 million, or 29%, to $2.8 billion in 2007 from 2006. 19 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interest earning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheet: Year Ended December 31, 2008 2007 2006 AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate Interest earning assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 5,217 $ 129 2.47 % $ 4,290 $ 223 5.20 % $ 2,450 $ 125 5.10 % Cash and investments segregated 11,223 280 2.49 % 9,991 511 5.11 % 12,758 602 4.72 % Broker related receivables (1) 428 8 1.87 % 595 27 4.54 % 533 25 4.69 % Receivables from brokerage clients 10,278 612 5.95 % 10,736 859 8.00 % 10,252 837 8.16 % Securities available for sale (2) 11,772 517 4.39 % 7,335 399 5.44 % 6,125 319 5.21 % Securities held to maturity 22 1 5.86 % Loans to banking clients 4,831 227 4.70 % 2,786 169 6.07 % 2,157 128 5.93 % Total interest earning assets 43,771 1,774 4.05 % 35,733 2,188 6.12 % 34,275 2,036 5.94 % Other interest revenue 134 82 77 Total interest earning assets $ 43,771 $ 1,908 4.36 % $ 35,733 $ 2,270 6.35 % $ 34,275 $ 2,113 6.16 % Funding sources: Deposits from banking clients $ 19,203 $ 104 0.54 % $ 12,046 $ 238 1.98 % $ 9,135 $ 200 2.19 % Payables to brokerage clients 15,220 55 0.36 % 14,768 329 2.23 % 17,865 426 2.38 % Short term borrowings 40 1 2.54 % Long term debt 890 59 6.63 % 531 38 7.16 % 419 29 6.92 % Total interest bearing liabilities 35,353 219 0.62 % 27,345 605 2.21 % 27,419 655 2.39 % Non interest bearing funding sources 8,418 8,388 6,856 Other interest expense 24 18 24 Total funding sources $ 43,771 $ 243 0.56 % $ 35,733 $ 623 1.74 % $ 34,275 $ 679 1.98 % Net interest revenue $ 1,665 3.80 % $ 1,647 4.61 % $ 1,434 4.18 % (1) Includes receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. (2) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost. The increases in net interest revenue in the last two years were primarily due to higher average interest earning assets, including increases in securities available for sale, and loans to banking clients, partially offset by higher average balances on deposits from banking clients. In addition, the increase in net interest revenue in 2008 was also partially offset by a decrease in receivables from brokerage clients, as well as generally lower yields on interest earning assets. Net interest revenue in 2007 included incremental interest revenue generated from temporarily investing the proceeds from the sale of U.S. Trust. Consistent with declines in general market interest rates prevalent in 2008, the Company experienced declines in the yields of all interest earning assets during 2008 as compared to 2007 and 2006. Accordingly, the average interest rates on deposits from banking clients and payables to brokerage clients also decreased during 2008 compared to 2007 and 2006. The decline in the average interest rate on long term debt was due to the additional debt issued at lower interest rates as part of the Companys capital restructuring in 2007. Certain interest bearing assets and liabilities of U.S. Trust retained by the Company in 2007 and 2006: The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts was previously swept into a money market deposit account at U.S. Trust. In May 2007, Schwab terminated this arrangement and moved all of these balances to a similar existing arrangement with Schwab Bank. The interest expense related to these client deposit balances maintained at U.S. Trust is included in interest expense from continuing operations on the Companys consolidated statements of income for 2007 and 2006. The interest expense was $4 million and $11 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The corresponding interest revenue on the invested cash balances related to these deposits is included in interest revenue from continuing operations on the Companys consolidated statements of income for 2007 and 2006. The interest revenue was $14 million and $38 million for 2007 and 2006, respectively. The interest revenue amount was calculated using the Companys funds transfer pricing methodology. Trading Revenue Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenues are affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenues are primarily 20 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) comprised of revenues from client fixed income securities trading activity. Factors that influence principal transaction revenues include the volume of client trades, market price volatility, and competitive pressures. Trading revenue increased by $220 million, or 26%, in 2008 from 2007 and $75 million, or 10%, in 2007 from 2006 due to higher daily average revenue trades and higher average revenue earned per revenue trade. As shown in the following table, daily average revenue trades executed by the Company increased 19% in 2008. The increase in daily average revenue trades was due to higher volumes of equity, mutual fund, option, and principal transaction trades. Average revenue earned per revenue trade increased 4% in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to higher average revenue earned per revenue trade for fixed income securities, partially offset by lower average revenue earned per revenue trade for option securities. Average revenue earned per revenue trade increased 4% in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to a higher proportion of equity trading volume outside the Companys active investor programs.

Other Revenue Other revenue includes realized gains and losses on sales of securities available for sale, service fees, and software maintenance fees. Other revenue decreased by $79 million, or 61%, in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to losses of $75 million related to two corporate debt securities in the Companys securities available for sale portfolio in 2008. On September 15, 2008, Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (Lehman) filed a Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition and on September 25, 2008, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) seized Washington Mutual Bank. As a result of these events, the Company sold these debt securities in 2008. Expenses Excluding Interest As shown in the table below, expenses excluding interest were relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007 primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by increases in other expense and occupancy and equipment expense. Expenses excluding interest increased in 2007 as compared to 2006 primarily due to higher compensation and benefits expense, advertising and market development expense, and professional services expense.

Incentive compensation is based on the achievement of specified performance objectives, including revenue growth, profit margin, and EPS, and therefore will fluctuate with these measures. Compensation and benefits expense decreased by $114 million, or 6%, in 2008 from 2007 due to decreases in incentive compensation and employee benefits and other expense, offset by an increase in salaries and wages. Compensation and benefits expense increased by $162 million, or 10%, in 2007 from 2006 due to increases in salaries and wages, incentive compensation, and employee benefits and other expense. The following table shows a comparison of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data: Growth Rate2007 2008 2008 2007 2006 Salaries and wages 7 % $ 1,020 $ 955 $ 872 Incentive compensation (1) (27 %) 402 552 504 Employee benefits and other (11 %) 245 274 243 Total compensation and benefits expense (6 %) $ 1,667 $ 1,781 $ 1,619 Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total net revenues: Salaries and wages 20 % 19 % 20 % Incentive compensation 8 % 11 % 12 % Employee benefits and other 4 % 6 % 6 % Total compensation and benefits expense 32 % 36 % 38 % Full time equivalent employees (in thousands) (2) At year end 1 % 13.4 13.3 12.4 Average 5 % 13.5 12.9 11.9 (1) Includes incentives, discretionary bonus costs, long term incentive plan, stock based compensation, and employee stock purchase plan expense. (2) Includes full time, part time and temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis, and excludes employees of outsourced service providers. Salaries and wages increased in 2008 from 2007 due to higher severance expense. Incentive compensation decreased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to lower long term incentive plan compensation, discretionary bonus costs, and variable compensation. Discretionary bonus costs and variable compensation decreased in 2008 from 2007 based on actual performance in 2008. Long term incentive plan compensation decreased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to the maturity of certain plan units that matured in 2007. Employee benefits and other expense decreased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to a decrease in deferred compensation. Salaries and wages and employee benefit and other expense increased in 2007 from 2006 due to an increase in full time employees. Incentive compensation increased in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to the increased cost of performance based incentive plans as a result of the Companys improved financial results in 2007 and stock based compensation. Expenses Excluding Compensation and Benefits Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to increases in data processing equipment and maintenance expense of $12 million and occupancy expense of $5 million. Advertising and market development expense increased in 2008 from 2007 due to an increase in media spending related to the Companys Talk to Chuck national advertising campaign. Communications expense increased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to higher levels of postage and printing costs of $8 million. Other expense increased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to charges of $29 million for individual client complaints and arbitration claims relating to Schwab YieldPlus Fund&reg; investments. 22 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Professional services expense increased in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to higher levels of fees paid to outsourced service providers and consultants. Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2007 from 2006 due to increases in data processing equipment and maintenance expense of $17 million and occupancy expense of $5 million. Advertising and market development expense increased in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to the Companys media and marketing spending related to its Talk to Chuck national advertising campaign. Communications expense increased in 2007 from 2006 due to higher levels of postage and printing costs of $15 million and news and quotes services of $5 million. Other expense increased in 2007 from 2006 primarily due to increases in regulatory fees of $7 million, bank service charges of $7 million, and charitable contributions of $4 million. Taxes on Income The Companys effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations was 39.3% in 2008 and 39.6% in both 2007 and 2006. Segment Information The Company provides financial services to individuals, and institutional and corporate clients through three segments Investor Services (formerly called Schwab Investor Services), Advisor Services (formerly called Schwab Institutional&reg;), and Corporate and Retirement Services (formerly called Schwab Corporate and Retirement Services). The Investor Services segment includes the Companys retail brokerage and banking operations. The Advisor Services segment provides custodial, trading, and support services to independent investment advisors. The Corporate and Retirement Services segment provides retirement plan services, plan administrator services, stock plan services, and mutual fund clearing services and supports the availability of Schwab proprietary mutual funds on third party platforms. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre tax basis excluding items such as restructuring charges, impairment charges on non financial assets, discontinued operations, and extraordinary items. Segment assets are not disclosed because the balances are not used for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments. 23 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Financial information for the Companys reportable segments is presented in the following table: For the year ended December 31, Growth Rate2007 2008 2008 2007 2006 Investor Services: Net revenues 1 % $ 3,385 $ 3,352 $ 2,940 Expenses excluding interest (2,107 ) (2,115 ) (1,982 ) Contribution margin 3 % $ 1,278 $ 1,237 $ 958 Advisor Services: Net revenues 12 % $ 1,250 $ 1,121 $ 966 Expenses excluding interest (4 %) (612 ) (639 ) (562 ) Contribution margin 32 % $ 638 $ 482 $ 404 Corporate and Retirement Services: Net revenues $ 504 $ 506 $ 373 Expenses excluding interest 6 % (389 ) (367 ) (268 ) Contribution margin (17 %) $ 115 $ 139 $ 105 Unallocated and other: Net revenues N/M $ 11 $ 15 $ 30 Expenses excluding interest N/M (14 ) (20 ) (21 ) Contribution margin N/M $ (3 ) $ (5 ) $ 9 Total: Net revenues 3 % $ 5,150 $ 4,994 $ 4,309 Expenses excluding interest (1 %) (3,122 ) (3,141 ) (2,833 ) Contribution margin 9 % $ 2,028 $ 1,853 $ 1,476 N/M Not meaningful. Investor Services Net revenues increased in 2008 by $33 million, or 1%, from 2007 primarily due to increases in trading revenue and net interest revenue, partially offset by the decrease in other revenue. Trading revenue increased due to higher daily average revenue trades. Net interest revenue increased due to higher levels of interest earning assets, partially offset by the impact of a decrease in the average net yield earned on these assets. The decrease in other revenue was primarily due to losses on investments in the Companys securities available for sale portfolio. Expenses excluding interest were relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007 as a result of lower incentive compensation expense, offset by a charge for individual client complaints and arbitration claims related to Schwab YieldPlus Fund investments in 2008. Net revenues increased in 2007 by $412 million, or 14%, from 2006 due to increases in net interest revenue and asset management and administration fees. Net interest revenue increased due to higher levels of market interest rates and changes in the composition of interest earning assets, including increases in securities available for sale and loans to banking clients. Asset management and administration fees increased as a result of higher balances of client assets in the Companys proprietary mutual funds and Mutual Fund OneSource&reg; service, as well as balances participating in advisory and managed account service programs. Expenses excluding interest increased in 2007 by $133 million, or 7%, from 2006 primarily due to higher client servicing and other related expenses, as well as higher market development expense. Advisor Services Net revenues increased in 2008 by $129 million, or 12%, from 2007 due to increases in trading revenue and asset management and administration fees, offset by the decrease in net interest revenue. Trading revenue increased due to higher daily average revenue trades. Asset management and administration fees increased as a result of higher balances of client assets in the Companys proprietary funds. Net interest revenue decreased due to the impact of a decrease in the average net yield earned on interest earning assets. Expenses excluding interest decreased in 2008 by $27 million, or 4%, from 2007 primarily due to lower incentive compensation expense. 24 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Net revenues increased in 2007 by $155 million, or 16%, from 2006 due to increases in asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue. Asset management and administration fees increased as a result of higher balances of client assets in the Companys proprietary mutual funds and Mutual Fund OneSource&reg; service, as well as balances participating in managed account service programs. Net interest revenue increased due to higher levels of market interest rates and changes in the composition of interest earning assets, including increases in securities available for sale. Expenses excluding interest increased in 2007 by $77 million, or 14%, from 2006 primarily due to higher business development, marketing and account servicing related expenses, as well as increased infrastructure investment. Corporate and Retirement Services Net revenues were flat in 2008 as compared to 2007 as a result of an increase in trading revenue offset by a decrease in net interest revenue. Trading revenue increased due to higher daily average revenue trades. Net interest revenue decreased due to the impact of a decrease in the average net yield earned on interest earning assets. Expenses excluding interest increased in 2008 by $22 million, or 6%, from 2007 due to increased costs to service additional corporate retirement plan participants resulting from the acquisition of the 401(k) Company, offset by lower incentive compensation expense. Net revenues increased in 2007 by $133 million, or 36%, from 2006 due to increases in asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue, as well as the acquisition of the 401(k) Company in March 2007. Asset management and administration fees increased as a result of higher balances of client assets in the Companys mutual funds and advisory and managed account service programs. Net interest revenue increased due to higher levels of market interest rates and changes in the composition of interest earning assets. Expenses excluding interest increased in 2007 by $99 million, or 37%, from 2006 primarily due to costs to service additional corporate retirement plan participants as a result of the acquisition of the 401(k) Company. Capital Restructuring In 2007, CSC completed a capital restructuring that returned approximately $3.3 billion in capital to stockholders to create a more efficient and cost effective capital structure. The capital restructuring included the following components: CSC paid a special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share, which returned $1.2 billion to stockholders. The special dividend was paid on August 24, 2007, to stockholders of record on July 24, 2007. CSC repurchased 84 million shares of its common stock through a modified Dutch Auction tender offer in August 2007. The tender offer period closed on July 31, 2007, and CSC accepted for purchase 84 million shares of its common stock, at a purchase price of $20.50 per share, for a total purchase price of $1.7 billion. CSC executed a separate Stock Purchase Agreement with Chairman and former CEO Charles R. Schwab, CSCs largest stockholder, and with certain additional stockholders whose shares Mr. Schwab was deemed to beneficially own. Under the Stock Purchase Agreement, Mr. Schwab and the other stockholders who are parties to the agreement did not participate in the tender offer, but instead, sold, and CSC purchased, 18 million shares, at a purchase price ($20.50 per share), which is the same as was determined and paid in the tender offer, for a total purchase price of $369 million. The number of shares repurchased resulted in Mr. Schwab maintaining the same beneficial percentage interest in CSCs outstanding common stock that he had prior to the tender offer and sale of shares pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement (approximately 18 percent, which does not take into consideration Mr. Schwabs outstanding options to acquire stock). The shares under this agreement were repurchased on August 15, 2007. CSC issued $250 million of 6.375% Senior Medium Term Notes due in 2017 in September 2007 and $300 million of junior subordinated notes in October 2007. For further discussion of the issuance of the junior subordinated notes, see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 12. Borrowings. Discontinued Operations On July 1, 2007, the Company completed the sale of all of the outstanding common stock of U.S. Trust for $3.3 billion in cash. CSC recognized a gain on the sale of $1.9 billion, or $1.2 billion after tax, in third quarter of 2007. In connection with the determination of the final income tax gain on the sale of U.S. Trust, the Company recorded additional tax expense of 25 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) $18 million in the second quarter of 2008. U.S. Trust is presented as a discontinued operation for all periods prior to the completion of the sale. Business Acquisition On March 31, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of The 401(k) Company, which offers retirement plan services, for $115 million in cash. As a result of a purchase price allocation, the Company recorded goodwill of $106 million and intangible assets of $8 million. The intangible assets are being amortized over 16 years. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CSC conducts substantially all of its business through its wholly owned subsidiaries. The capital structure among CSC and its subsidiaries is designed to provide each entity with capital and liquidity to meet its operational needs and regulatory requirements. CSC is a savings and loan holding company and Schwab Bank, CSCs depository institution, is a federal savings bank. CSC and Schwab Bank are both subject to supervision and regulation by the Office of Thrift Supervision. Liquidity CSC As a savings and loan holding company, CSC is not subject to specific statutory capital requirements. However, CSC is required to maintain capital that is sufficient to support the holding company and its subsidiaries business activities, and the risks inherent in those activities. To manage capital adequacy, CSC currently utilizes a target Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve Board, of at least 6%. At December 31, 2008, CSCs Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 8.6%. CSCs liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries, as well as cash provided by external financing. CSC maintains excess liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits to cover daily funding needs and to support growth in the Companys business. Generally, CSC does not hold liquidity at its subsidiaries in excess of amounts deemed sufficient to support the subsidiaries operations, including any regulatory capital requirements. Schwab and Schwab Bank are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with CSC. Management believes that funds generated by the operations of CSCs subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting CSCs liquidity needs, providing adequate liquidity to meet Schwab Banks capital guidelines, and maintaining Schwabs net capital. CSC has liquidity needs that arise from its Senior Medium Term Notes, Series A (Medium Term Notes), and junior subordinated notes, as well as from the funding of cash dividends, acquisitions, and other investments. The Medium Term Notes, of which $458 million was outstanding at December 31, 2008, have maturities ranging from 2009 to 2017 and fixed interest rates ranging from 6.375% to 8.05% with interest payable semiannually. The Medium Term Notes are rated A2 by Moodys Investors Service (Moodys), A by Standard & Poors Ratings Group (S&P), and A by Fitch IBCA, Inc. (Fitch). At December 31, 2008, $300 million of junior subordinated notes were outstanding and have a fixed interest rate of 7.50% until 2017 and a floating rate thereafter. The junior subordinated notes are not rated, however the trust preferred securities related to these notes are rated A3 by Moodys, BBB+ by S&P, and A by Fitch. For further discussion of the issuance of the junior subordinated notes, see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 12. Borrowings. CSC has a universal automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC which enables CSC to issue debt, equity and other securities. This registration statement was filed in December 2008. CSCs prior shelf registration statement/prospectus supplement for issuing Medium Term Notes and universal shelf registration statement both expired in November 2008. 26 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue unsecured commercial paper notes (Commercial Paper Notes) not to exceed $1.5 billion. Management has set a current limit for the commercial paper program of $800 million. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and is not subject to voluntary prepayment. The proceeds of the commercial paper program are to be used for general corporate purposes. CSC commenced issuing Commercial Paper Notes in April 2008. Average borrowings for the year ended December 31, 2008 were $40 million. There were no Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at December 31, 2008. CSCs ratings for these short term borrowings are P 1 by Moodys, A 1 by S&P, and F1 by Fitch. CSC maintains an $800 million committed, unsecured credit facility with a group of fourteen banks which is scheduled to expire in June 2009. CSC plans to establish a similar facility to replace this one when it expires. This facility was unused in 2008. Any issuances under CSCs commercial paper program will reduce the amount available under this facility. The funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes, including repayment of the Commercial Paper Notes discussed above. The financial covenants under this facility require Schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, as defined, Schwab Bank to be well capitalized, as defined, and CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders equity. At December 31, 2008, the minimum level of stockholders equity required under this facility was $2.6 billion. Management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on its ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements. CSC also has direct access to $1.0 billion of the $1.1 billion uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines discussed below, that are primarily utilized by Schwab to manage short term liquidity. The amount available to CSC under these lines is lower than the amount available to Schwab because the credit line provided by one of these banks is only available to Schwab. These lines were not used by CSC in 2008. In addition, Schwab provides CSC with a $1.0 billion credit facility maturing in 2009. No funds were drawn under this facility at December 31, 2008. Schwab Schwab is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers. These regulations prohibit Schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings to CSC, paying cash dividends, or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent or employees if such payment would result in net capital of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. At December 31, 2008, Schwabs net capital was $1.2 billion (16% of aggregate debit balances), which was $1.1 billion in excess of its minimum required net capital and $840 million in excess of 5% of aggregate debit balances. Most of Schwabs assets are readily convertible to cash, consisting primarily of short term (i.e., less than 150 days) investment grade, interest earning investments (the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements), receivables from brokerage clients, and receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. Client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities. Receivables from and payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions, which usually settle, or can be closed out, within a few business days. Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which were $19.2 billion, $19.5 billion, and $19.9 billion at December 31, 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for Schwab in the future. The Company has a finance lease obligation related to an office building and land under a 20 year lease. The remaining finance lease obligation of $116 million at December 31, 2008 is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term of approximately 16 years. To manage short term liquidity, Schwab maintains uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with a group of six banks totaling $1.1 billion at December 31, 2008. The need for short term borrowings arises primarily from timing differences 27 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest bearing investments, and movements of cash to meet segregation requirements. Schwab used such borrowings for eighteen days in 2008, with daily amounts borrowed averaging $117 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2008. To satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), Schwab has unsecured standby letter of credit (LOCs) agreements with seven banks in favor of the OCC aggregating $550 million at December 31, 2008. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. Schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by arranging LOCs, in favor of these brokerage clients, which are issued by multiple banks. At December 31, 2008, the aggregate face amount of these LOCs totaled $100 million. No funds were drawn under any of these LOCs during 2008. To manage Schwabs regulatory capital requirement, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.4 billion subordinated revolving credit facility which is scheduled to expire in March 2010. The amount outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2008 was $220 million. Borrowings under this subordinated lending arrangement qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. In addition, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.5 billion credit facility which is scheduled to expire in 2011. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. At December 31, 2008, $153 million was outstanding under this facility, which was subsequently repaid on January 2, 2009. Schwab Bank Schwab Bank is required to maintain a capital level that at least equals minimum capital levels specified in federal banking laws and regulations. Failure to meet the minimum levels will result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct effect on Schwab Bank. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2008, Schwab Bank is considered well capitalized. Schwab Banks regulatory capital and ratios are as follows: Actual Minimum CapitalRequirement Minimum to beWell Capitalized December 31, 2008 Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Tier 1 Capital $ 1,650 15.3 % $ 432 4.0 % $ 647 6.0 % Total Capital $ 1,671 15.5 % $ 863 8.0 % $ 1,079 10.0 % Leverage $ 1,650 6.4 % $ 1,037 4.0 % $ 1,296 5.0 % Tangible Equity $ 1,650 6.4 % $ 518 2.0 % N/A N/A Not applicable. Schwab Banks current liquidity needs are generally met through deposits from banking clients and equity capital. The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts is swept into a money market deposit account at Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2008, these balances totaled $18.4 billion. Additionally, Schwab Bank has access to traditional funding sources such as deposits, federal funds purchased, and repurchase agreements. Schwab Bank has access to short term funding through the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) discount window. Amounts available under the FRB discount window are dependent on the amount of Schwab Banks mortgage backed securities available for sale that are pledged as collateral. At December 31, 2008, $187 million was available under this arrangement. There were no funds drawn under this arrangement during 2008. Schwab Bank maintains a credit facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLB). Amounts available under this facility are dependent on the amount of Schwab Banks home equity lines of credit that are pledged as collateral. At December 31, 2008, $415 million was available under this facility. There were no funds drawn under this facility during 2008. 28 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) CSC provides Schwab Bank with a $100 million short term credit facility which is scheduled to expire in December 2009. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab Bank. No funds were drawn under this facility during 2008. Capital Resources The Company monitors both the relative composition and absolute level of its capital structure. Management is focused on limiting the Companys use of capital and currently targets a long term debt to total financial capital ratio of less than 30%. The Companys total financial capital (long term debt plus stockholders equity) at December 31, 2008 was $4.9 billion, up $313 million, or 7%, from December 31, 2007. At December 31, 2008, the Company had long term debt of $883 million, or 18% of total financial capital, that bears interest at a weighted average rate of 7.03%. At December 31, 2007, the Company had long term debt of $899 million, or 19% of total financial capital. The Company repaid $20 million and $43 million of long term debt in 2008 and 2007, respectively. The Companys cash position (reported as cash and cash equivalents on the Companys consolidated balance sheet) and cash flows are affected by changes in brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines. Timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that date may arise in the ordinary course of business and are addressed by the Company in accordance with applicable regulations. Other factors which affect the Companys cash position and cash flows include investment activity in securities, levels of capital expenditures, acquisition and divestiture activity, banking client deposit activity, brokerage and banking client loan activity, financing activity in long term debt, payments of dividends, and repurchases of CSCs common stock. The combination of these factors can cause significant fluctuations in the levels of cash and cash equivalents during specific time periods. Capital Expenditures The Companys capital expenditures were $196 million in 2008 and $168 million in 2007. Capital expenditures as a percentage of net revenues were 4% and 3% in 2008 and 2007, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2008 included software and equipment relating to the Companys information technology systems, buildings, and leasehold improvements. Capital expenditures in 2007 were primarily for software and equipment relating to the Companys information technology systems. Capital expenditures include capitalized costs for developing internal use software of $46 million in 2008 and $57 million in 2007. Management currently anticipates that 2009 capital expenditures will be approximately 25% lower than 2008 spending, primarily due to decreased spending on software relating to the Companys information technology systems, as well as decreased spending on buildings. As has been the case in recent years, the Company may adjust its capital expenditures from period to period as business conditions change. Management believes that funds generated by its operations will continue to be the primary funding source of its capital expenditures. Dividends CSC paid common stock cash dividends of $253 million in 2008. CSC paid common stock cash dividends of $1.5 billion in 2007, which included a special cash dividend of $1.2 billion. Since the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 79 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend 19 times, including a 20% increase in the third quarter of 2008. Since 1989, dividends have increased by a 28% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. CSC paid common stock dividends of $.220, $1.200, and $.135 per share in 2008, 2007, and 2006, respectively. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, the Company currently targets its cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income. 29 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Share Repurchases CSC repurchased 17 million shares of its common stock for $350 million in 2008. CSC repurchased 135 million shares of its common stock, including shares repurchased under the tender offer and the Stock Purchase Agreement described below for $2.7 billion in 2007. As of December 31, 2008, CSC had remaining authority from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to $596 million of its common stock. On July 31, 2007, CSC completed a share repurchase through a tender offer. CSC accepted for purchase 84 million shares of its common stock at a price of $20.50 per share, for a total purchase price of $1.7 billion. Pursuant to the tender offer rules, CSC was prohibited from making open market repurchases of its common stock during the tender offer period and until August 15, 2007. Under the Stock Purchase Agreement executed on July 2, 2007 with Chairman and former CEO Charles R. Schwab, CSCs largest stockholder, and with certain additional stockholders whose shares Mr. Schwab is deemed to beneficially own, CSC purchased 18 million shares at a price of $20.50 per share for a total of $369 million on August 15, 2007. Acquisition and Divestiture On July 1, 2007, the Company completed the sale of U.S. Trust and received proceeds of $3.3 billion. On March 31, 2007, the Company completed its acquisition of The 401(k) Company for $115 million in cash. Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company enters into various off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of its clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, the Company enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 13. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. 30 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Contractual Obligations A summary of the Companys principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2008, is shown in the following table. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet that are generally short term in nature (e.g., drafts payable) or without contractual payment terms (e.g., deposits from banking clients, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation). Management believes that funds generated by its continuing operations, as well as cash provided by external financing, will continue to be the primary funding sources in meeting these obligations.

RISK MANAGEMENT Overview The Companys business activities expose it to a variety of risks including technology and operations risk, credit, market and liquidity risks, and legal and reputational risk. Identification and management of these risks are essential to the success and financial soundness of the Company. Senior management takes an active role in the Companys risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling various risks. Oversight of risk management has been delegated to the Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior managers of major business and control functions. The Global Risk Committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Companys risk exposures, and leading the continued development of the Companys risk management policies and practices. Functional risk sub committees focusing on specific areas of risk report into the Global Risk Committee. These sub committees include: Corporate Asset Liability Management and Pricing Committee, which focuses on the Companys liquidity, capital resources, interest rate risk, and investments; Credit and Market Risk Oversight Committee, which focuses on the credit exposures resulting from client activity (e.g., margin lending activities and loans to banking clients), the investing activities of certain of the Companys proprietary funds, corporate credit activities (e.g., counterparty and corporate investing activities), and market risk resulting from the Company taking positions in certain securities to facilitate client trading activity; 31 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Technology and Operations Risk Committee, which focuses on the integrity of controls and operating capacity of the Companys systems and operations processes; Fiduciary Risk Committee, which oversees activities of the Company with a fiduciary component; New Products Committee, which addresses risks associated with new products and services; and Information Security and Privacy Steering Committee, which oversees information security and privacy programs and policies. The Global Risk Committee reports regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee), which reviews major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Companys Disclosure Committee is responsible for the monitoring and evaluation of the effectiveness of the Companys (a) disclosure controls and procedures and (b) internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. Additionally, the Companys compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and risk and credit management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring the Companys risk management. Risk is inherent in the Companys business. Consequently, despite the Companys efforts to identify areas of risk, oversee operational areas involving risk, and implement policies and procedures designed to manage risk, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses due to operating or other risks. The following discussion highlights the Companys policies and procedures for identification, assessment, and management of the principal areas of risk in its operations. Technology and Operating Risk Technology and operating risk is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems that constrain the Companys ability to gather, process and communicate information and process client transactions efficiently and securely, without interruptions. The Companys operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the Companys success depends, in part, on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs. To the extent the Company experiences system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to its systems, linkages with third party systems, and power failures), the Companys business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted. Additionally, rapid increases in client demand may strain the Companys ability to enhance its technology and expand its operating capacity. To minimize business interruptions, Schwab has two data centers intended, in part, to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency. The Company is committed to an ongoing process of upgrading, enhancing, and testing its technology systems. This effort is focused on meeting client needs, meeting market and regulatory changes, and deploying standardized technology platforms. Technology and operating risk also includes the risk of human error, employee misconduct, external fraud, computer viruses, terrorist attack, and natural disaster. Employee misconduct could include fraud and misappropriation of client or Company assets, improper use or disclosure of confidential client or Company information, and unauthorized activities, such as transactions exceeding acceptable risks or authorized limits. External fraud includes misappropriation of client or Company assets by third parties, including through unauthorized access to Company systems and data and client accounts. The frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase. The Company has specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and uses periodic risk self assessments and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The Company maintains backup and recovery functions, including facilities for backup and communications, and conducts periodic testing of disaster recovery plans. The Company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data. 32 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Despite the Companys risk management efforts, it is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure, or fraud or other misconduct, and the precautions taken by the Company may not be effective in all cases. The Company may be subject to litigation, losses, and regulatory actions in such cases, and may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. The Company also faces technology and operating risk when it employs the services of various external vendors, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, and support functions. The Company manages its exposure to such outsourcing risks through contractual provisions, control standards, and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance. The Company maintains policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with Company data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non public client information. The Company clearly defines for employees, contractors, and vendors the Companys expected standards of care for confidential data. Regular training is provided by the Company in regard to data security. The Company is actively engaged in the research and development of new technologies, services, and products. The Company endeavors to protect its research and development efforts, and its brands, through the use of copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and contracts. Credit Risk Credit risk is the potential for loss due to a client or counterparty failing to perform its contractual obligations, or the value of collateral held to secure obligations proving to be inadequate. The Companys direct exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending activities, securities lending activities, mortgage lending activities, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds that the Company sponsors. To manage the risks of such losses, the Company has established policies and procedures which include: establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin requirements for certain securities. In addition, most of the Companys credit extensions, such as margin loans to clients, securities lending agreements, and resale agreements, are supported by collateral arrangements. These arrangements are subject to requirements to provide additional collateral in the event that market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received. The Companys credit exposure related to loans to banking clients is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews performed by management. Management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations, delinquencies, non performing loans, losses, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses, which is reviewed quarterly by senior management. The Companys loan portfolios primarily include first lien 3 , 5 and 7 year adjustable rate mortgage loans (First Mortgage portfolio) of $3.2 billion and home equity lines of credit (HELOC portfolio) of $2.7 billion at December 31, 2008. The Company does not offer loans that allow for negative amortization. The Company maintains credit underwriting standards that have limited the exposure to the types of loans that experienced high foreclosures and loss rates elsewhere in the industry during 2008. The Company does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a Fair Isaac & Company (FICO) credit score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. At December 31, 2008, approximately 1% of both the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios consisted of loans to borrowers with FICO credit scores of less than 620. 33 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The following table presents certain of the Companys loan quality metrics as a percentage of total outstanding loans: December 31, 2008 2007 Loan delinquencies (1) 0.54 % 0.80 % Nonaccrual loans 0.13 % 0.12 % Allowance for credit losses 0.33 % 0.20 % (1) Loan delinquencies are defined as loans that are 30 days or more past due. The Company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale portfolio, which totaled $14.4 billion at December 31, 2008. This portfolio includes U.S. agency and non agency mortgage backed securities, corporate debt securities, long term certificates of deposit, asset backed securities and U.S. agency notes. U.S. agency mortgage backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings, however management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. agencies. Included in non agency mortgage backed securities are securities collateralized by loans that are considered to be Prime (defined by the Company as loans to borrowers with a FICO credit score of 620 or higher at origination), and Alt A (defined by the Company as Prime loans with reduced documentation at origination). The table below presents the credit ratings for U.S. agency and non agency mortgage backed securities, including prime and Alt A mortgage backed securities by year of origination. In some instances securities have divergent ratings from Moodys, Fitch Ratings or Standard and Poors. In these instances the Company has used the lowest rating as of December 31, 2008 for purposes of presenting the table below. Mortgage backed securities, particularly Alt A securities, experienced deteriorating credit characteristics, including increased delinquencies, and valuation pressure in 2008.

Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwabs client or a counterparty fails to meet its obligations to Schwab. Concentration Risk The Company is subject to concentration risk when holding large positions of financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry. The Companys investments in mortgage backed securities totaled $10.4 billion at December 31, 2008. Of these, $8.2 billion were U.S. agency securities and $2.2 billion were non agency securities. Included in non agency mortgage backed securities are securities collateralized by Alt A loans. At December 31, 2008, the amortized cost and fair value of Alt A mortgage backed securities were $798 million and $429 million, respectively. The Companys investments in corporate debt securities and commercial paper totaled $3.5 billion at December 31, 2008, with the majority issued by institutions in the financial services industry. Included in corporate debt securities and commercial paper at December 31, 2008, were $2.6 billion of securities issued by financial institutions and guaranteed under the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. These corporate debt securities and commercial paper are included in securities available for sale and cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes in the Companys consolidated balance sheets. The Companys loans to banking clients includes $3.2 billion of first lien residential real estate mortgage loans at December 31, 2008. Approximately 80% of these mortgages consisted of loans with interest only payment terms. The interest rates on approximately 80% of these interest only loans are not scheduled to reset for three or more years. All interest only loans are underwritten based on underwriting standards that do not include interest terms described as temporary introductory rates below current market rates. At December 31, 2008, 33% of the residential real estate mortgages and 46% of the home equity lines of credit balances were secured by properties which are located in California. The Company is also subject to concentration risk from its margin and securities lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or industry. The Company is subject to indirect exposure to U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral to secure its resale agreements. The Companys primary credit exposure on these resale transactions is with its counterparty. The Company would have exposure to the U.S. Government and agency securities only in the event of the counterpartys default on the resale agreements. U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral for resale agreements, at December 31, 2008, totaled $6.8 billion. Market Risk Market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices or market conditions. For discussion of the Companys market risk, see Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Fiduciary Risk Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. The Company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various fiduciary risk committees. 35 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Legal and Regulatory Risk The Company faces significant legal and compliance risk in its business, and the volume of litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed have been increasing. Among other things, these risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for Company products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of the Companys controls. Claims against the Company may increase due to a variety of factors, such as if clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions, as the Company increases the level of advice it provides to clients, and as the Company enhances the services it provides to IAs. In addition, the Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, and SROs, and such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex. The Company attempts to manage legal and compliance risk through policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid litigation claims and prevent or detect violations of applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti money laundering, client privacy, employment policies, and contracts management. Despite the Companys efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls, legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm, significant losses and disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the Companys business activities. FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses fair value measurements to record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value in accordance with SFAS No. 157 Fair Value Measurements (SFAS No. 157), and to determine fair value disclosures. At December 31, 2008, 42% of total assets ($21.9 billion) were recorded at fair value. All of these assets were measured at fair value using quoted prices or market based information and accordingly were classified as Level 1 or Level 2 measurements in accordance with SFAS No. 157. Liabilities recorded at fair value were not material at December 31, 2008. See note 15 Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities for more information on the Companys assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value. The Company uses prices obtained from an independent third party pricing service to measure the fair value of certain investment securities. The Company validates prices received from the pricing service using various methods including, comparison to prices received from additional pricing services, comparison to available quoted market prices, internal valuation models, and review of other relevant market data including implied yields of major categories of securities. The Company does not adjust the prices received from the independent third party pricing service unless such prices are inconsistent with SFAS No. 157 and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts. At December 31, 2008, the Company did not adjust prices received from the independent third party pricing service. For certificates of deposits and treasury securities included in investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes, the Company uses discounted cash flow models to measure the fair value that utilize market based inputs including observable market interest rates that correspond to the remaining maturities or next interest reset dates. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While the majority of the Companys revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the Companys financial position and reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Companys financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. 36 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Other than Temporary Impairment of Securities Available for Sale and Securities Held to Maturity: Management evaluates securities available for sale and securities held to maturity for other than temporary impairment on a quarterly basis. For debt securities, other than temporary impairment exists if management determines it is probable that the Company will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the security. Other than temporary impairment also exists if management no longer has the ability or intent to hold a security with an unrealized loss for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. If management determines other than temporary impairment exists, the cost basis of the security is adjusted to the then current fair value, with a corresponding loss recognized in current earnings. If future evaluations conclude that an impairment now considered to be temporary is other than temporary, the Company would recognize a realized loss through earnings at that time. The evaluation of whether other than temporary impairment exists is a matter of judgment. The evaluation includes the assessment of several factors including: 1) whether the unrealized loss is solely due to changes in interest rates, 2) the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost, 3) the financial condition of the issuer, if applicable, 4) the credit ratings of the issuer or security, 5) the credit characteristics of the collateral underlying the security, including the credit default experience, delinquency rates, cumulative losses to date and the ratio of credit enhancement available under the terms of the security to expected losses for non agency mortgage backed securities, and 6) the Companys intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery. Additionally, management utilizes cash flow models for securities that exhibit deteriorating credit characteristics to estimate the expected cash flow from the securities in order to assess whether it is probable that the Company will not collect all amounts due under the contractual terms of the security. These cash flow models require management to estimate future principal prepayments, default rates, and default loss severities based on underlying collateral, and future housing price changes. Further deterioration of these characteristics could result in the recognition of other than temporary impairment. Valuation of Goodwill: Under the provisions of Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 142 Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at least annually, or whenever indications of impairment exist. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess. The Company has elected April 1 st as its annual goodwill impairment testing date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on April 1, 2008, management estimated the fair value of each of the Companys reporting units (generally defined as the Companys businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and compared this value to the carrying value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit was greater than its carrying value, and therefore management concluded that no amount of goodwill was impaired. The estimated fair value of the reporting units was established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit. Adverse changes in the Companys planned business operations such as unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit, or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the Companys recorded goodwill. Allowance for Credit Losses: The Company regularly evaluates its portfolio of loans to banking clients and provides allowances for the portion management believes may be uncollectible. Several factors are taken into consideration in this evaluation including current economic conditions, the composition of the loan portfolio, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the loan portfolio. For Schwab Banks portfolio, which primarily consists of mortgage loans and home equity lines of credit, a risk based methodology is used to determine the allowance for credit losses. Loans are categorized into portfolios by loan type and risk characteristics. A probable loss rate, based on company and industry experience, is used to determine the credit allowance. Legal Reserve: Reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, insurance coverage and indemnification, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are 37 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. The Companys management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Companys significant estimates discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.
