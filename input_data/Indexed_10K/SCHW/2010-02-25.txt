Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Management of the Company focuses on several key financial and non financial metrics in evaluating the Companys financial position and operating performance. All information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K is presented on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. Summarized results for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007 are shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate1 Year2008 2009 2009 2008 2007 Client Activity Metrics: Net new client assets (in billions) (1) (23 %) $ 87.3 $ 113.4 $ 160.2 Client assets (in billions, at year end) 25 % $ 1,422.6 $ 1,137.0 $ 1,445.5 Clients daily average trades (in thousands) (4 %) 333.6 346.6 284.9 Company Financial Metrics: Net revenues (19 %) $ 4,193 $ 5,150 $ 4,994 Expenses excluding interest (7 %) 2,917 3,122 3,141 Income from continuing operations before taxes on income (37 %) 1,276 2,028 1,853 Taxes on income (39 %) (489 ) (798 ) (733 ) Income from continuing operations (36 %) 787 1,230 1,120 (Loss) income from discontinued operations, net of tax N/M (18 ) 1,287 Net income (35 %) $ 787 $ 1,212 $ 2,407 Earnings per share from continuing operations diluted (36 %) $ .68 $ 1.06 $ .92 Earnings per share diluted (35 %) $ .68 $ 1.05 $ 1.96 Net revenue (decline) growth from prior year (19 %) 3 % 16 % Pre tax profit margin from continuing operations 30.4 % 39.4 % 37.1 % Return on stockholders equity 17 % 31 % 55 % Net revenue per average full time equivalent employee (in thousands) (12 %) $ 338 $ 383 $ 387 (1) Net new client assets in 2007 includes $23.0 billion related to the acquisition of The 401(k) Company and $3.3 billion related to a mutual fund clearing services client. N/M Not meaningful. Net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows. Management believes that this metric depicts how well the Companys products and services appeal to new and existing clients. Client assets is the market value of all client assets housed at the Company. Management considers client assets to be indicative of the Companys appeal in the marketplace. Additionally, fluctuations in certain components of client assets (e.g., Mutual Fund OneSource funds) directly impacts asset management and administration fee revenues. Clients daily average trades is an indicator of client engagement with securities markets and the most prominent driver of trading revenues. Management believes that earnings per share, net revenue growth, pre tax profit margin from continuing operations, and return on stockholders equity provide broad indicators of the Companys overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns within the context of a given operating environment. Net revenue per average full time equivalent employee is considered by management to be the Companys broadest measure of productivity. 15 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The Companys major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. The Company generates asset management and administration fees through its proprietary and third party mutual fund offerings, as well as fee based investment management and advisory services. Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue are impacted by securities valuations, interest rates, the Companys ability to attract new clients, and client activity levels. The Company generates trading revenues through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenues from trading activity in fixed income securities. Trading revenues are impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of prices in the equity and fixed income markets, and commission rates. 2009 Compared to 2008 Economic and market conditions remained challenging throughout 2009, marked by unprecedented market dynamics including further declines in short term interest rates and home valuations, increases in home foreclosures and delinquencies, and tight credit markets. While the federal funds target rate remained unchanged at a range of zero to 0.25%, the three month LIBOR decreased by 158 basis points to 0.25%. At the same time, although the equity markets showed sustained improvement from their March 2009 lows the Nasdaq Composite Index, the Standard & Poors 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased during the year by 44%, 24%, and 19%, respectively average equity market valuations declined in 2009 from 2008. In this shifting market environment, clients continued to actively utilize the Companys products and services. The Company attracted $87.3 billion in net new client assets during the year. Total client assets were $1.42 trillion at December 31, 2009, up 25% from the prior year, reflecting the Companys success in continuing to attract and retain clients. Client trading activity slowed modestly during the year as clients daily average trades decreased 4% to 333,600 in 2009 from 2008. Net revenues decreased by 19% in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to the decreases in asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue. Asset management and administration fees decreased in 2009 primarily due to money market mutual fund fee waivers and lower average equity market valuations. Given the low interest rate environment, the overall yields on certain Schwab sponsored money market mutual funds have fallen to levels at or below the management fees on those funds. As a result, the Company waived a portion of its fees which totaled $224 million in order to provide a positive return to clients. There were no money market mutual fund fee waivers in 2008 or 2007. Net interest revenue decreased as a result of the low interest rate environment, partially offset by higher average balances of interest earning assets. These decreases were offset by the increase in other revenue. Other revenue in 2009 included a $31 million gain on the repurchase of a portion of the Companys long term debt. In addition, other revenue in 2008 included a loss of $29 million on the sale of a corporate debt security held in the Companys available for sale portfolio. Net revenues were also negatively impacted by net impairment charges of $60 million in 2009 relating to certain residential mortgage backed securities in the Companys available for sale portfolio. Net impairment losses on securities in 2008 included an other than temporary impairment charge of $44 million related to a corporate debt security held in the Companys available for sale portfolio. Expenses excluding interest decreased by 7% in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to the decreases in compensation and benefits, professional services, and advertising and market development expenses. The decrease in expenses was partially offset by severance and facilities charges of $101 million relating to the Companys cost reduction measures and a $16 million Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) special industry assessment. As a result of the Companys cost reduction measures and ongoing expense discipline, the Company achieved a pre tax profit margin from continuing operations of 30.4% and return on stockholders equity of 17% in 2009. Net revenue per average full time equivalent employee was $338,000 in 2009, down 12% from 2008 due to lower net revenues, partially offset by the decrease in average full time equivalent employees. 2008 Compared to 2007 2008 was also marked by extraordinary market conditions, including downward pressure on home prices, tight credit markets, liquidity concerns, significant volatility and sharp declines in the equity markets, and slow general economic activity. The 16 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Nasdaq Composite Index, Standard & Poors 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased in 2008 by 41%, 38%, and 34%, respectively, with a significant portion of these decreases occurring in the fourth quarter. In addition, the federal funds target rate decreased during 2008 by 4.25% to a range of zero to 0.25% at December 31, 2008. Net new client assets totaled $113.4 billion for 2008, down 29% from 2007, reflecting deterioration in the equity markets and lower asset valuations. Total client assets were $1.14 trillion at December 31, 2008, down 21% from December 31, 2007. Additionally, clients daily average trades increased 22% to 346,600 in 2008 from 2007. Net revenues grew by 3% in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to an increase in trading revenue, partially offset by a decrease in other revenue, as well as net impairment losses on securities incurred in 2008. Trading revenue increased in 2008 primarily due to higher trading volume as a result of significant volatility in the equity markets during the year. The decrease in other revenue related to a loss of $29 million on the sale of a corporate debt security and net impairment losses on securities included an other than temporary impairment charge of $44 million related to another corporate debt security, which were held in the Companys available for sale portfolio. Asset management and administration fees remained relatively flat in 2008, reflecting the Companys ability to attract and retain clients. Net interest revenue increased slightly in 2008 due to higher levels of interest earning assets offset by the impact of a decrease in the average net yield earned on these assets. Although expenses excluding interest remained relatively flat in 2008, compensation and benefits expense decreased reflecting lower incentive compensation, while other expense and occupancy and equipment expense increased. The loss from discontinued operations of $18 million in 2008 relates to the adjustment to finalize the income tax gain related to the sale of U.S. Trust. The Companys pre tax profit margin from continuing operations was 39.4% and return on stockholders equity was 31% in 2008, which reflected the Companys sustained expense discipline during the year. Return on stockholders equity in 2007 included a $1.2 billion after tax gain on the sale of U.S. Trust, as well as incremental interest revenue generated from temporarily investing the proceeds from the sale. Net revenue per average full time equivalent employee was $383,000 in 2008, down 1% from 2007 as net revenue growth was lower than the increase in average full time equivalent employees. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. All references to EPS information in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflect diluted EPS unless otherwise noted. Subsequent Event On January 26, 2010, the Company completed the sale of 29,670,300 shares of its common stock, $.01 par value, at a public offering price of $19.00 per share. Net proceeds received from the offering were $543 million and will be used to support the Companys balance sheet growth, including expansion of its deposit base and potential migration of certain client balances from money market funds into Schwab Bank. CURRENT MARKET ENVIRONMENT The difficult market conditions in 2009 continue to adversely affect the Companys net revenues. While the Company generally earns asset management and administration fees based upon daily balances of certain client assets, these fees are currently being affected by the low interest rate environment as well. The overall yields on certain Schwab sponsored money market mutual funds have fallen to levels at or below the management fees on those funds. The Company continues to waive a portion of its management fees, which it began to do in the first quarter of 2009, so that the funds may continue providing a positive return to clients. These and other money market mutual funds may continue to find it necessary to replace maturing securities with lower yielding securities as a result of the current interest rate environment and the overall yield on such funds may fall below or further below the management fees on those funds. To the extent this occurs, the amount of fees waived may increase from fourth quarter 2009 levels, which would adversely affect asset management and administration fees. 17 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Given the low interest rate environment, the Companys revenue from interest earning assets, such as securities held and loans to clients, was declining more than the interest that the Company pays on funding sources, such as client deposits. The Companys ability to reduce the interest expense paid on funding sources has been limited as the rates paid on funding sources, which are largely tied to shorter term interest rates, approached zero. Concurrently, interest earning asset yields, which are often tied to longer term interest rates, continued to decline. By the end of 2009, however, the pace of further declines in interest earning asset yields had slowed significantly. The Company recorded net impairment charges of $60 million related to certain non agency residential mortgage backed securities in 2009 due to credit deterioration of the securities underlying collateral. Further deterioration in the performance of the underlying loans in the Companys residential mortgage backed securities portfolio could result in the recognition of additional future impairment charges. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion presents an analysis of the Companys results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2009, 2008, and 2007. Net Revenues The Companys major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. Asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue decreased in 2009 as compared to 2008. Asset management and administration fees were relatively flat, while net interest revenue and trading revenue increased in 2008 as compared to 2007.

The Company earns mutual fund service fees for shareholder services, administration, investment management, and transfer agent services (through July 2009) provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third party funds. These fees are based upon the daily balances of client 18 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) assets invested in the Companys proprietary funds and third party funds. The Company also earns asset management fees for advisory and managed account services, which are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third party mutual funds are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data. Asset management and administration fees may vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees, see Current Market Environment. As shown in the following table, asset management and administration fees decreased by $480 million, or 20%, in 2009 from 2008. This decrease was due to decreases in mutual fund service fees and investment management and trust fees. Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate2008 2009 2009 2008 2007 Asset management and administration fees before money market mutual fund fee waivers (11 %) $ 2,099 $ 2,355 $ 2,358 Money market mutual fund fee waivers N/M (224 ) Asset management and administration fees (20 %) $ 1,875 $ 2,355 $ 2,358 N/M Not meaningful. Mutual fund service fees decreased by $414 million, or 22%, in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to money market mutual fund fee waivers. Given the low interest rate environment in 2009, the overall yields on certain Schwab sponsored money market mutual funds have fallen to levels at or below the management fees on those funds. As a result, the Company waived a portion of its fees which totaled $224 million in 2009 in order to provide a positive return to clients. There were no money market mutual fund fee waivers in 2008 or 2007. In addition, mutual fund service fees decreased during the year due to lower average balances of client assets invested in the Companys Mutual Fund OneSource funds and mutual fund clearing services as a result of lower average equity market valuations. Investment management and trust fees decreased by $67 million, or 20%, in 2009 from 2008 due to temporary fee rebates offered to qualifying clients for choosing to participate in advisory or managed account services programs. Asset management and administration fees remained relatively flat in 2008 from 2007, primarily due to lower third party mutual fund and advisory service fees, partially offset by higher proprietary fund fees. Mutual Fund OneSource service fees decreased by $77 million, or 12%, in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to lower average balances of client assets invested in the Companys Mutual Fund OneSource funds. The Companys proprietary mutual fund service fees increased $98 million, or 8%, in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to higher average balances of client assets invested in the Companys money market mutual funds. Investment management and trust fees decreased by $38 million, or 10%, in 2008 from 2007 due to lower average balances of client assets participating in advisory and managed account services programs. Net Interest Revenue Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies. The Company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest earning assets generally reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities). When interest rates fall, the Company attempts to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock in asset yields as well as by lowering rates paid to clients on interest bearing liabilities. Since the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients, as well as the rates charged on receivables from brokerage clients, and also controls the composition of its investment securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread. However, the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on net interest revenue, see Current Market Environment. 19 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) In clearing its clients trades, Schwab holds cash balances payable to clients. In most cases, Schwab pays its clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment, and may invest these funds and earn interest revenue. Receivables from brokerage clients consist primarily of margin loans to brokerage clients. Margin loans are loans made by Schwab to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities. Pursuant to SEC regulations, client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients, which are recorded in cash and investments segregated on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. When investing segregated client cash balances, Schwab must adhere to SEC regulations that restrict investments to securities guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, participation certificates, mortgage backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, certificates of deposit issued by U.S. banks and thrifts, and resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities. Additionally, Schwab has established policies for the minimum credit quality and maximum maturity of these investments. Schwab Bank also maintains investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funding from deposits raised in excess of loans to banking clients. Schwab Banks securities available for sale include residential mortgage backed securities, U.S. agency notes, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, and asset backed securities. Schwab Banks securities held to maturity include residential mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities, and corporate debt securities. Schwab Bank lends funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans. These loans are largely funded by interest bearing deposits from banking clients. The Companys interest earning assets are financed primarily by brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients. Non interest bearing funding sources include noninterest bearing brokerage client cash balances and proceeds from stock lending activities, as well as stockholders equity. The following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interest earning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheet: Year Ended December 31, 2009 2008 2007 AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate Interest earning assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 7,848 $ 33 0.42 % $ 5,217 $ 129 2.47 % $ 4,290 $ 223 5.20 % Cash and investments segregated 16,291 80 0.49 % 11,223 280 2.49 % 9,991 511 5.11 % Broker related receivables (1) 363 1 0.28 % 428 8 1.87 % 595 27 4.54 % Receivables from brokerage clients 6,749 351 5.20 % 10,278 612 5.95 % 10,736 859 8.00 % Other securities owned 126 1 0.79 % Securities available for sale (2) 18,558 521 2.81 % 11,772 517 4.39 % 7,335 399 5.44 % Securities held to maturity 1,915 74 3.86 % 22 1 5.86 % Loans to banking clients 6,671 241 3.61 % 4,831 227 4.70 % 2,786 169 6.07 % Loans held for sale 110 5 4.55 % 66 4 6.06 % 37 2 5.41 % Total interest earning assets 58,631 1,307 2.23 % 43,837 1,778 4.06 % 35,770 2,190 6.12 % Other interest revenue 121 130 80 Total interest earning assets $ 58,631 $ 1,428 2.44 % $ 43,837 $ 1,908 4.35 % $ 35,770 $ 2,270 6.35 % Funding sources: Deposits from banking clients $ 31,249 $ 107 0.34 % $ 19,203 $ 104 0.54 % $ 12,046 $ 238 1.98 % Payables to brokerage clients 18,002 3 0.02 % 15,220 55 0.36 % 14,768 329 2.23 % Short term borrowings 40 1 2.54 % Long term debt 1,231 71 5.77 % 890 59 6.63 % 531 38 7.16 % Total interest bearing liabilities 50,482 181 0.36 % 35,353 219 0.62 % 27,345 605 2.21 % Non interest bearing funding sources 8,149 8,484 8,425 Provision for credit losses 38 17 3 Other interest expense 2 7 15 Total funding sources $ 58,631 $ 221 0.38 % $ 43,837 $ 243 0.55 % $ 35,770 $ 623 1.74 % Net interest revenue $ 1,207 2.06 % $ 1,665 3.80 % $ 1,647 4.61 % (1) Includes receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. (2) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost. Net interest revenue decreased in 2009 from 2008 due to the low interest rate environment that persisted throughout the year. As a result, the Company experienced declines in the yields and rates of all interest earning assets and interest bearing 20 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) liabilities compared to 2008, with yields on interest earning assets declining more than the cost of funding sources as short term interest rates approached zero. The mix of interest earning assets also negatively affected net interest revenue most notably the decrease in average margin loans resulted in higher average balances of cash and investments segregated, a lower yielding asset category. The effect of the low interest rate environment and asset mix was partially offset by the growth in average balances. The Company experienced significant growth in deposits from banking clients, which in turn funded increases in the average balances of securities available for sale, loans to banking clients, and cash and cash equivalents. Net interest revenue slightly increased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to higher average balances of interest earning assets, including increases in securities available for sale and loans to banking clients, offset by lower yields on interest earning assets. Net interest revenue in 2007 included incremental interest revenue generated from temporarily investing the proceeds from the sale of U.S. Trust. Consistent with declines in general market interest rates prevalent in 2008, the Company experienced declines in the yields of all interest earning assets during 2008 as compared to 2007. Accordingly, the average interest rates on deposits from banking clients and payables to brokerage clients also decreased during 2008. The decline in the average interest rate on long term debt was due to the additional debt issued at lower interest rates as part of the Companys capital restructuring in 2007. Trading Revenue Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenues are affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenues are primarily comprised of revenues from client fixed income securities trading activity. Factors that influence principal transaction revenues include the volume of client trades, market price volatility, and competitive pressures. Trading revenue decreased by $84 million, or 8%, in 2009 from 2008 due to lower daily average revenue trades and lower average revenue earned per revenue trade, as trading volume and market volatility eased from 2008 levels. Trading revenue increased by $220 million, or 26%, in 2008 from 2007 due to higher daily average revenue trades and higher average revenue earned per revenue trade. As shown in the following table, daily average revenue trades decreased 2% in 2009. The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes of principal transaction and mutual fund trades. Average revenue earned per revenue trade decreased 5% in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower average revenue earned per revenue trade for principal transactions and mutual funds, partially offset by higher average revenue earned per revenue trade for option securities. Daily average revenue trades increased 19% in 2008 from 2007 due to higher volumes of equity, mutual fund, option, and principal transaction trades. Average revenue earned per revenue trade increased 4% in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to higher average revenue earned per revenue trade for principal transactions, partially offset by lower average revenue earned per revenue trade for option securities.

Other Revenue Other revenue includes gains on the repurchases of long term debt, realized gains and losses on sales of securities available for sale, gains and losses on sales of loans held for sale, service fees, and software maintenance fees. Other revenue increased by $81 million, or 86%, in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to the recognition of a gain on the repurchase of a portion of the Companys long term debt. The Company repurchased $98 million of trust preferred securities related to its Junior Subordinated Notes for a cash payment of $67 million in 2009. The repurchase of the trust preferred securities is considered 21 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) an extinguishment of a portion of the Junior Subordinated Notes and resulted in a gain of $31 million. Other revenue decreased by $35 million, or 27%, in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to a realized loss of $29 million on the sale of a corporate debt security issued by Washington Mutual Bank as a result of its seizure by the FDIC in September 2008. This security was held in the Companys available for sale portfolio. Net Impairment Losses on Securities The Company recorded net impairment charges of $60 million related to certain non agency residential mortgage backed securities in the Companys available for sale portfolio in 2009 due to credit deterioration of the securities underlying collateral. In 2008, the Company recognized an other than temporary impairment charge of $44 million on a corporate debt security issued by Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc. (Lehman) as a result of Lehmans Chapter 11 bankruptcy petition filing in September 2008. The Company sold this security in October 2008. This security was held in the Companys available for sale portfolio. For further discussion, see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 5. Securities Available for Sale and Securities Held to Maturity. Expenses Excluding Interest As shown in the table below, expenses excluding interest decreased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to decreases in compensation and benefits expense, professional services expense, and advertising and market development expense. Expenses excluding interest were relatively flat in 2008 compared to 2007 primarily due to a decrease in compensation and benefits expense, partially offset by increases in other expense and occupancy and equipment expense.

Incentive compensation is based on the achievement of specified performance objectives, including revenue growth and pre tax profit margin, and therefore will fluctuate with these measures. 22 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Compensation and benefits expense decreased by $123 million, or 7%, in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to decreases in salaries and wages expense and incentive compensation. Compensation and benefits expense decreased by $114 million, or 6%, in 2008 from 2007 due to decreases in incentive compensation and employee benefits and other expense, offset by an increase in salaries and wages expense. The following table shows a comparison of certain compensation and benefits components and employee data: Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate2008 2009 2009 2008 2007 Salaries and wages (9 %) $ 930 $ 1,020 $ 955 Incentive compensation (1) (12 %) 355 402 552 Employee benefits and other 6 % 259 245 274 Total compensation and benefits expense (7 %) $ 1,544 $ 1,667 $ 1,781 Compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of total net revenues: Salaries and wages 22 % 20 % 19 % Incentive compensation 8 % 8 % 11 % Employee benefits and other 7 % 4 % 6 % Total compensation and benefits expense 37 % 32 % 36 % Full time equivalent employees (in thousands) (2) At year end (7 %) 12.4 13.4 13.3 Average (8 %) 12.4 13.5 12.9 (1) Includes variable compensation, discretionary bonus costs, stock based compensation, and employee stock purchase plan expense. (2) Includes full time, part time and temporary employees, and persons employed on a contract basis, and excludes employees of outsourced service providers. Salaries and wages decreased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower expense as a result of decreases in full time employees and persons employed on a contract basis, offset by severance expense of $58 million relating to the Companys cost reduction measures. Incentive compensation decreased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower variable compensation based on actual performance in 2009. In addition, incentive compensation in 2008 included long term incentive plan compensation. The last performance period under the Companys long term incentive program ended on December 31, 2008. Salaries and wages increased in 2008 from 2007 due to higher severance expense. Incentive compensation decreased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to lower long term incentive plan compensation, discretionary bonus costs, and variable compensation. Discretionary bonus costs and variable compensation decreased in 2008 from 2007 based on actual performance in 2008. Long term incentive plan compensation decreased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to the maturity of certain plan units that matured in 2007. Employee benefits and other expense decreased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to a decrease in deferred compensation. Expenses Excluding Compensation and Benefits Professional services expense decreased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to a decrease in fees paid to outsourced service providers and consultants. Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to facilities charges of $43 million relating to the Companys cost reduction measures, partially offset by lower purchases of equipment. Occupancy and equipment expense increased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to increases in data processing equipment and maintenance expense of $12 million and occupancy expense of $5 million. Advertising and market development expense decreased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower media spending relating to the Companys Talk to Chuck national advertising campaign. Media spending and marketing expense decreased by $39 million and $13 million, respectively. Advertising and market development expense increased in 2008 from 2007 due to higher media spending related to the Talk to Chuck national advertising campaign. 23 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Other expense increased in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to a $16 million FDIC special industry assessment and higher FDIC insurance premiums caused by higher deposits from banking clients, partially offset by a decrease in employee travel expenses and insurance recovery of certain costs incurred in 2008. Other expense increased in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to charges of $29 million for individual client complaints and arbitration claims relating to Schwab YieldPlus Fund&reg; investments. Taxes on Income The Companys effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations before taxes was 38.3% in 2009, 39.3% in 2008, and 39.6% in 2007. The decrease in the Companys effective income tax rate on income from continuing operations from 2008 was primarily due to lower effective state income tax rates. Segment Information The Company provides financial services to individuals and institutional clients through two segments Investor Services and Institutional Services. The Investor Services segment includes the Companys retail brokerage and banking operations. The Institutional Services segment provides custodial, trading, and support services to independent investment advisors, as well as retirement plan services, plan administrator services, equity compensation plan services, and mutual fund clearing services. In addition, the Institutional Services segment supports the availability of Schwab proprietary mutual funds and collective trust funds on third party platforms. The Company evaluates the performance of its segments on a pre tax basis, excluding items such as impairment charges on non financial assets, discontinued operations, extraordinary items, and other significant restructuring charges. Segment assets and liabilities are not disclosed because the balances are not used for evaluating segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources to segments. Financial information for the Companys reportable segments is presented in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate2008 2009 2009 2008 2007 Investor Services: Net revenues (20 %) $ 2,710 $ 3,385 $ 3,352 Expenses excluding interest (10 %) 1,906 2,107 2,115 Contribution margin (37 %) $ 804 $ 1,278 $ 1,237 Institutional Services: Net revenues (15 %) $ 1,483 $ 1,754 $ 1,627 Expenses excluding interest (7 %) 929 1,001 1,006 Contribution margin (26 %) $ 554 $ 753 $ 621 Unallocated: Net revenues N/M $ $ 11 $ 15 Expenses excluding interest N/M 82 14 20 Contribution margin N/M $ (82 ) $ (3 ) $ (5 ) Total: Net revenues (19 %) $ 4,193 $ 5,150 $ 4,994 Expenses excluding interest (7 %) 2,917 3,122 3,141 Contribution margin (37 %) $ 1,276 $ 2,028 $ 1,853 N/M Not meaningful. Investor Services Net revenues decreased by $675 million, or 20%, in 2009 from 2008 due to decreases in asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue, partially offset by an increase in other revenue. Asset management and administration fees decreased primarily due to lower average asset valuations and money market mutual fund fee waivers. Net interest revenue decreased as a result of the low interest rate environment, partially offset by higher average balances of interest earning 24 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) assets. The increase in other revenue was primarily due to the recognition of a gain on the repurchase of a portion of the Companys long term debt. In addition, other revenue in 2008 included a loss on the sale of a corporate debt security held in the Companys available for sale portfolio. Net revenues were also negatively impacted by net impairment charges relating to certain residential mortgage backed securities in the Companys available for sale portfolio. Expenses excluding interest decreased by $201 million, or 10%, in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to lower compensation and benefits, professional services, and advertising and market development expenses. Net revenues increased by $33 million, or 1%, in 2008 from 2007 primarily due to increases in trading revenue and net interest revenue, partially offset by a decrease in other revenue. Trading revenue increased due to higher daily average revenue trades. Net interest revenue increased due to higher levels of interest earning assets, partially offset by the impact of a decrease in the average net yield earned on these assets. The decrease in other revenue was primarily due to a loss on the sale of a corporate debt security. The increase in net revenues was also offset by an other than temporary impairment charge related to another corporate debt security. These securities were held in the Companys available for sale portfolio. Expenses excluding interest were relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007 as a result of lower incentive compensation expense, offset by a charge for individual client complaints and arbitration claims related to Schwab YieldPlus Fund investments in 2008. Institutional Services Net revenues decreased by $271 million, or 15%, in 2009 from 2008 due to decreases in asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue, partially offset by an increase in other revenue. Asset management and administration fees decreased primarily due to lower average asset valuations and money market mutual fund fee waivers. Net interest revenue decreased as a result of the low interest rate environment, partially offset by higher average balances of interest earning assets. Trading revenue decreased due to lower daily average revenue trades and lower average revenue earned per revenue trade. Net impairment losses on securities increased due to credit deterioration of certain mortgage backed securities underlying collateral. The increase in other revenue was primarily due to the recognition of a gain on the repurchase of a portion of the Companys long term debt. Expenses excluding interest decreased by $72 million, or 7%, in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower compensation and benefits and professional services expenses, partially offset by an increase in other expense. Net revenues increased by $127 million, or 8%, in 2008 from 2007 due to increases in trading revenue and asset management and administration fees, offset by a decrease in net interest revenue. Trading revenue increased due to higher daily average revenue trades. Asset management and administration fees increased as a result of higher average balances of client assets invested in the Companys proprietary funds. Net interest revenue decreased due to the impact of a decrease in the average net yield earned on interest earning assets. Expenses excluding interest were relatively flat in 2008 as compared to 2007 as a result of lower incentive compensation expense, offset by increased costs to service additional corporate retirement plan participants resulting from the acquisition of the 401(k) Company in 2007. Unallocated Expenses excluding interest in 2009 include facilities and severance charges relating to the Companys cost reduction measures. Discontinued Operations In July 2007, the Company sold all of the outstanding common stock of U.S. Trust for $3.3 billion in cash and recognized a gain on the sale of $1.9 billion, or $1.2 billion after tax. In connection with the determination of the final income tax gain on the sale of U.S. Trust, the Company recorded additional tax expense of $18 million in the second quarter of 2008. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES CSC conducts substantially all of its business through its wholly owned subsidiaries. The capital structure among CSC and its subsidiaries is designed to provide each entity with capital and liquidity to meet its operational needs and regulatory requirements. 25 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) CSC is a savings and loan holding company and Schwab Bank, CSCs depository institution, is a federal savings bank. CSC and Schwab Bank are both subject to supervision and regulation by the Office of Thrift Supervision. Liquidity CSC As a savings and loan holding company, CSC is not subject to specific statutory capital requirements. However, CSC is required to maintain capital that is sufficient to support the holding company and its subsidiaries business activities, and the risks inherent in those activities. To manage capital adequacy, CSC currently utilizes a target Tier 1 Leverage Ratio, as defined by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, of at least 6%. At December 31, 2009, CSCs Tier 1 Leverage Ratio was 7.1%. CSCs liquidity needs are generally met through cash generated by its subsidiaries, as well as cash provided by external financing. CSC maintains excess liquidity in the form of overnight cash deposits and short term investments to cover daily funding needs and to support growth in the Companys business. Generally, CSC does not hold liquidity at its subsidiaries in excess of amounts deemed sufficient to support the subsidiaries operations, including any regulatory capital requirements. Schwab and Schwab Bank are subject to regulatory requirements that may restrict them from certain transactions with CSC. Management believes that funds generated by the operations of CSCs subsidiaries will continue to be the primary funding source in meeting CSCs liquidity needs, providing adequate liquidity to meet Schwab Banks capital guidelines, and maintaining Schwabs net capital. CSC has liquidity needs that arise from its Senior Medium Term Notes, Series A (Medium Term Notes), Junior Subordinated Notes, and Senior Notes, as well as from the funding of cash dividends, acquisitions, and other investments. The Medium Term Notes, of which $450 million were outstanding at December 31, 2009, have maturities ranging from 2010 to 2017 and fixed interest rates ranging from 6.375% to 8.05% with interest payable semiannually. The Medium Term Notes are rated A2 by Moodys Investors Service (Moodys), A by Standard & Poors Ratings Group (Standard & Poors), and A by Fitch Ratings, Ltd. (Fitch). At December 31, 2009, $202 million of Junior Subordinated Notes were outstanding and have a fixed interest rate of 7.50% until 2017 and a floating rate thereafter. The Junior Subordinated Notes are not rated, however the trust preferred securities related to these notes are rated Baa1 by Moodys, BBB+ by Standard & Poors, and BBB+ by Fitch. In 2009, CSC repurchased $98 million of trust preferred securities related to its Junior Subordinated Notes for a cash payment of $67 million. The repurchase of the trust preferred securities is considered an extinguishment of a portion of the Junior Subordinated Notes and resulted in a gain of $31 million. CSC has a universal automatic shelf registration statement on file with the SEC which enables CSC to issue debt, equity and other securities. In June 2009, the Company issued $750 million of Senior Notes that mature in 2014 under this registration statement. The Senior Notes have a fixed interest rate of 4.950% with interest payable semiannually. The Senior Notes are rated A2 by Moodys, A by Standard & Poors, and A by Fitch. In January 2010, the Company completed an equity offering of 29,670,300 shares of its common stock under this registration statement. For further discussion of the equity offering, see Subsequent Event. CSC has authorization from its Board of Directors to issue unsecured commercial paper notes (Commercial Paper Notes) not to exceed $1.5 billion. Management has set a current limit for the commercial paper program of $800 million. The maturities of the Commercial Paper Notes may vary, but are not to exceed 270 days from the date of issue. The commercial paper is not redeemable prior to maturity and cannot be voluntarily prepaid. The proceeds of the commercial paper program are to be used for general corporate purposes. There were no Commercial Paper Notes outstanding at December 31, 2009. CSCs ratings for these short term borrowings are P 1 by Moodys, A 1 by Standard & Poors, and F1 by Fitch. CSC maintains an $800 million committed, unsecured credit facility with a group of 12 banks, which is scheduled to expire in June 2010. This facility replaced a similar facility that expired in June 2009. These facilities were unused in 2009. The funds under this facility are available for general corporate purposes, including repayment of the Commercial Paper Notes discussed above. The amount of this facility that CSC can use for other general corporate purposes is reduced by the amount of any 26 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Commercial Paper Notes outstanding. The financial covenants under this facility require Schwab to maintain a minimum net capital ratio, as defined, Schwab Bank to be well capitalized, as defined, and CSC to maintain a minimum level of stockholders equity. At December 31, 2009, the minimum level of stockholders equity required under this facility was $3.3 billion. Management believes that these restrictions will not have a material effect on CSCs ability to meet foreseeable dividend or funding requirements. CSC also has direct access to $744 million of the $824 million uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines discussed below, that are primarily utilized by Schwab to manage short term liquidity. These lines were not used by CSC in 2009. In addition, Schwab provides CSC with a $1.0 billion credit facility maturing in December 2011. No funds were drawn under this facility at December 31, 2009. Schwab Schwab is subject to regulatory requirements that are intended to ensure the general financial soundness and liquidity of broker dealers. These regulations prohibit Schwab from repaying subordinated borrowings from CSC, paying cash dividends, or making unsecured advances or loans to its parent company or employees if such payment would result in net capital of less than 5% of aggregate debit balances or less than 120% of its minimum dollar requirement of $250,000. At December 31, 2009, Schwabs net capital was $1.1 billion (11% of aggregate debit balances), which was $868 million in excess of its minimum required net capital and $580 million in excess of 5% of aggregate debit balances. Most of Schwabs assets are readily convertible to cash, consisting primarily of short term (i.e., less than 150 days) investment grade, interest earning investments (the majority of which are segregated for the exclusive benefit of clients pursuant to regulatory requirements), receivables from brokerage clients, and receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. Client margin loans are demand loan obligations secured by readily marketable securities. Receivables from and payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations primarily represent current open transactions, which usually settle, or can be closed out, within a few business days. Liquidity needs relating to client trading and margin borrowing activities are met primarily through cash balances in brokerage client accounts, which were $25.3 billion and $19.2 billion at December 31, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Management believes that brokerage client cash balances and operating earnings will continue to be the primary sources of liquidity for Schwab in the future. Schwab has a finance lease obligation related to an office building and land under a 20 year lease. The remaining finance lease obligation of $111 million at December 31, 2009, is being reduced by a portion of the lease payments over the remaining lease term of approximately 15 years. To manage short term liquidity, Schwab maintains uncommitted, unsecured bank credit lines with a group of seven banks totaling $824 million at December 31, 2009. The need for short term borrowings arises primarily from timing differences between cash flow requirements, scheduled liquidation of interest bearing investments, and movements of cash to meet segregation requirements. Schwab used such borrowings for ten days in 2009, with daily amounts borrowed averaging $18 million. There were no borrowings outstanding under these lines at December 31, 2009. To satisfy the margin requirement of client option transactions with the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC), Schwab has unsecured standby letter of credit agreements (LOCs) with seven banks in favor of the OCC aggregating $445 million at December 31, 2009. In connection with its securities lending activities, Schwab is required to provide collateral to certain brokerage clients. Schwab satisfies the collateral requirements by arranging LOCs, in favor of these brokerage clients, which are issued by multiple banks. At December 31, 2009, the aggregate face amount of these LOCs totaled $37 million. There were no funds drawn under any of these LOCs during 2009. 27 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) To manage Schwabs regulatory capital requirement, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.4 billion subordinated revolving credit facility which is scheduled to expire in March 2010. The amount outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2009, was $220 million. Borrowings under this subordinated lending arrangement qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. In addition, CSC provides Schwab with a $1.5 billion credit facility which is scheduled to expire in 2011. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab. There were no funds drawn under this facility at December 31, 2009. Schwab Bank Schwab Bank is required to maintain a capital level that at least equals minimum capital levels specified in federal banking laws and regulations. Failure to meet the minimum levels will result in certain mandatory, and possibly additional discretionary, actions by the regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct material effect on Schwab Bank. Based on its regulatory capital ratios at December 31, 2009, Schwab Bank is considered well capitalized. Schwab Banks regulatory capital and ratios at December 31, 2009, are as follows: Actual Minimum CapitalRequirement Minimum to beWell Capitalized Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Amount Ratio Tier 1 Capital $ 2,724 18.3 % $ 595 4.0 % $ 893 6.0 % Total Capital $ 2,770 18.6 % $ 1,191 8.0 % $ 1,488 10.0 % Tier 1 Leverage $ 2,724 6.3 % $ 1,737 4.0 % $ 2,171 5.0 % Tangible Equity $ 2,724 6.3 % $ 868 2.0 % N/A N/A Not applicable. In light of the evolving regulatory environment and capitalization trends observed across the banking industry, management has established a target Tier 1 Leverage Ratio for Schwab Bank of at least 7.5% beginning in the first quarter of 2010. Schwab Banks current liquidity needs are generally met through deposits from banking clients and equity capital. The excess cash held in certain Schwab brokerage client accounts is swept into deposit accounts at Schwab Bank. At December 31, 2009, these balances totaled $23.0 billion. Schwab Bank has access to traditional funding sources such as deposits, federal funds purchased, and repurchase agreements. Additionally, Schwab Bank has access to short term funding through the Federal Reserve Bank (FRB) discount window. Amounts available under the FRB discount window are dependent on the fair value of certain of Schwab Banks securities available for sale and securities held to maturity that are pledged as collateral. At December 31, 2009, $974 million was available under this arrangement. There were no funds drawn under this arrangement during 2009. Schwab Bank maintains a credit facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank System (FHLB). Amounts available under this facility are dependent on the amount of Schwab Banks residential real estate mortgages and home equity lines of credit that are pledged as collateral. At December 31, 2009, $2.9 billion was available under this facility. There were no funds drawn under this facility during 2009. CSC provides Schwab Bank with a $100 million short term credit facility which is scheduled to expire in December 2011. Borrowings under this facility do not qualify as regulatory capital for Schwab Bank. There were no funds drawn under this facility during 2009. Capital Resources The Company monitors both the relative composition and absolute level of its capital structure. Management is focused on limiting the Companys use of capital and currently targets a long term debt to total financial capital ratio not to exceed 30%. 28 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The Companys total financial capital (long term debt plus stockholders equity) at December 31, 2009, was $6.6 billion, up $1.6 billion, or 33%, from December 31, 2008. At December 31, 2009, the Company had long term debt of $1.5 billion, or 23% of total financial capital, that bears interest at a weighted average rate of 5.97%. At December 31, 2008, the Company had long term debt of $883 million, or 18% of total financial capital. In June 2009, the Company issued $750 million of Senior Notes that mature in 2014 and have a fixed interest rate of 4.950%. The Company repaid $13 million and $20 million of long term debt in 2009 and 2008, respectively. In addition, the Company repurchased $98 million of trust preferred securities related to its Junior Subordinated Notes for a cash payment of $67 million in 2009, resulting in a gain of $31 million. The Companys cash position (reported as cash and cash equivalents on its consolidated balance sheet) and cash flows are affected by changes in brokerage client cash balances and the associated amounts required to be segregated under regulatory guidelines. Timing differences between cash and investments actually segregated on a given date and the amount required to be segregated for that date may arise in the ordinary course of business and are addressed by the Company in accordance with applicable regulations. Other factors which affect the Companys cash position and cash flows include investment activity in securities, levels of capital expenditures, acquisition and divestiture activity, banking client deposit activity, brokerage and banking client loan activity, financing activity in long term debt, payments of dividends, and repurchases of CSCs common stock. The combination of these factors can cause significant fluctuations in the levels of cash and cash equivalents during specific time periods. Capital Expenditures The Companys capital expenditures were $139 million in 2009 and $196 million in 2008. Capital expenditures as a percentage of net revenues were 3% and 4% in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Capital expenditures in 2009 were primarily for leasehold improvements, software and equipment relating to the Companys information technology systems, and building improvements. Capital expenditures in 2008 were primarily for software and equipment relating to the Companys information technology systems, buildings, and leasehold improvements. Capital expenditures include capitalized costs for developing internal use software of $16 million in 2009 and $46 million in 2008. Management currently anticipates that 2010 capital expenditures will be approximately 5% lower than 2009 spending primarily due to decreased spending on leasehold improvements, partially offset by increased costs for developing internal use software. As has been the case in recent years, the Company may adjust its capital expenditures from period to period as business conditions change. Management believes that funds generated by its operations will continue to be the primary funding source of its capital expenditures. Dividends CSC paid common stock cash dividends of $279 million and $253 million in 2009 and 2008, respectively. Since the initial dividend in 1989, CSC has paid 83 consecutive quarterly dividends and has increased the quarterly dividend 19 times, including a 20% increase in the third quarter of 2008. Since 1989, dividends have increased by a 27% compounded annual growth rate, excluding the special cash dividend of $1.00 per common share in 2007. CSC paid common stock dividends of $.24, $.22, and $1.20 per share in 2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. While the payment and amount of dividends are at the discretion of the Board, subject to certain regulatory and other restrictions, the Company currently targets its cash dividend at approximately 20% to 30% of net income. Share Repurchases There were no repurchases of CSCs common stock in 2009. CSC repurchased 17 million shares of its common stock for $350 million in 2008. As of December 31, 2009, CSC had remaining authority from the Board of Directors to repurchase up to $596 million of its common stock. 29 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Off Balance Sheet Arrangements The Company enters into various off balance sheet arrangements in the ordinary course of business, primarily to meet the needs of its clients. These arrangements include firm commitments to extend credit. Additionally, the Company enters into guarantees and other similar arrangements as part of transactions in the ordinary course of business. For information on each of these arrangements, see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 13. Commitments and Contingent Liabilities. Contractual Obligations A summary of the Companys principal contractual obligations as of December 31, 2009, is shown in the following table. Excluded from this table are liabilities recorded on the consolidated balance sheet that are generally short term in nature (e.g., payables to brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations) or without contractual payment terms (e.g., deposits from banking clients, payables to brokerage clients, and deferred compensation). Management believes that funds generated by its continuing operations, as well as cash provided by external financing, will continue to be the primary funding sources in meeting these obligations.

Based on the current interest rate of 7.50% and no repayments of principal, the estimated future interest payments on the Junior Subordinated Notes in 2018 to 2067 would be $15 million per year. Amounts exclude maturities under a finance lease obligation, unamortized discounts, and the effect of interest rate swaps.

Includes purchase obligations which can be canceled by the Company without penalty. RISK MANAGEMENT Overview The Companys business activities expose it to a variety of risks including technology, operations, credit, market, liquidity, legal, and reputational risk. Identification and management of these risks are essential to the success and financial soundness of the Company. Senior management takes an active role in the Companys risk management process and has developed policies and procedures under which specific business and control units are responsible for identifying, measuring, and controlling various risks. Oversight of risk management has been delegated to the Global Risk Committee, which is comprised of senior managers of major business and control functions. The Global Risk Committee is responsible for reviewing and monitoring the Companys risk exposures and leading the continued development of the Companys risk management policies and practices. 30 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Functional risk sub committees focusing on specific areas of risk report into the Global Risk Committee. These sub committees include the: Corporate Asset Liability Management and Pricing Committee, which focuses on the Companys liquidity, capital resources, interest rate risk, and investments; Credit and Market Risk Oversight Committee, which focuses on the credit exposures resulting from client activity (e.g., margin lending activities and loans to banking clients), the investing activities of certain of the Companys proprietary funds, corporate credit activities (e.g., counterparty and corporate investing activities), and market risk resulting from the Company taking positions in certain securities to facilitate client trading activity; Information Security and Privacy Steering Committee, which oversees information security and privacy programs and policies; Investment Management and ERISA Risk Committee, which oversees activities in which the Company and its principals operate in an investment advisory capacity or as an ERISA fiduciary; and Investment Products Review Board, which provides senior level oversight of investment products and services made available to clients. The Global Risk Committee reports regularly to the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors (Audit Committee), which reviews major risk exposures and the steps management has taken to monitor and control such exposures. The Companys Disclosure Committee is responsible for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of the Companys (a) disclosure controls and procedures and (b) internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal quarter. The Disclosure Committee reports on this evaluation to the CEO and CFO prior to their certification required by Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002. The Companys compliance, finance, internal audit, legal, and risk and credit management departments assist management and the various risk committees in evaluating, testing, and monitoring the Companys risk management. Risk is inherent in the Companys business. Consequently, despite the Companys efforts to identify areas of risk and implement risk management policies and procedures, there can be no assurance that the Company will not suffer unexpected losses due to operating or other risks. The following discussion highlights the Companys policies and procedures for identification, assessment, and management of the principal areas of risk in its operations. Technology and Operating Risk Technology and operating risk is the potential for loss due to deficiencies in control processes or technology systems that constrain the Companys ability to gather, process and communicate information and process client transactions efficiently and securely, without interruptions. The Companys operations are highly dependent on the integrity of its technology systems and the Companys success depends, in part, on its ability to make timely enhancements and additions to its technology in anticipation of evolving client needs. To the extent the Company experiences system interruptions, errors or downtime (which could result from a variety of causes, including changes in client use patterns, technological failure, changes to its systems, linkages with third party systems, and power failures), the Companys business and operations could be significantly negatively impacted. Additionally, rapid increases in client demand may strain the Companys ability to enhance its technology and expand its operating capacity. To minimize business interruptions, Schwab has two data centers intended, in part, to further improve the recovery of business processing in the event of an emergency. The Company is committed to an ongoing process of upgrading, enhancing, and testing its technology systems. This effort is focused on meeting client needs, meeting market and regulatory changes, and deploying standardized technology platforms. Technology and operating risk also includes the risk of human error, employee misconduct, external fraud, computer viruses, terrorist attack, and natural disaster. Employee misconduct could include fraud and misappropriation of client or Company assets, improper use or disclosure of confidential client or Company information, and unauthorized activities, such as transactions exceeding acceptable risks or authorized limits. External fraud includes misappropriation of client or Company assets by third parties, including through unauthorized access to Company systems and data and client accounts. The frequency and sophistication of such fraud attempts continue to increase. 31 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The Company has specific policies and procedures to identify and manage operational risk, and uses periodic risk self assessments and internal audit reviews to evaluate the effectiveness of these internal controls. The Company maintains backup and recovery functions, including facilities for backup and communications, and conducts periodic testing of disaster recovery plans. The Company also maintains policies and procedures and technology to protect against fraud and unauthorized access to systems and data. Despite the Companys risk management efforts, it is not always possible to deter or prevent technological or operational failure, or fraud or other misconduct, and the precautions taken by the Company may not be effective in all cases. The Company may be subject to litigation, losses, and regulatory actions in such cases, and may be required to expend significant additional resources to remediate vulnerabilities or other exposures. The Company also faces technology and operating risk when it employs the services of various external vendors, including domestic and international outsourcing of certain technology, processing, and support functions. The Company manages its exposure to external vendor risk through contractual provisions, control standards, and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance. The Company maintains policies and procedures regarding the standard of care expected with Company data, whether the data is internal company information, employee information, or non public client information. The Company clearly defines for employees, contractors, and vendors the Companys expected standards of care for confidential data. Regular training is provided by the Company in regard to data security. The Company is actively engaged in the research and development of new technologies, services, and products. The Company endeavors to protect its research and development efforts, and its brands, through the use of copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and contracts. Credit Risk Credit risk is the potential for loss due to a borrower, counterparty, or issuer failing to perform its contractual obligations. The Companys direct exposure to credit risk mainly results from margin lending activities, securities lending activities, mortgage lending activities, its role as a counterparty in financial contracts and investing activities, and indirectly from the investing activities of certain of the proprietary funds that the Company sponsors. To manage the risks of such losses, the Company has established policies and procedures which include: establishing and reviewing credit limits, monitoring of credit limits and quality of counterparties, and adjusting margin requirements for certain securities. Most of the Companys credit extensions are supported by collateral arrangements. Collateral arrangements relating to margin loans, securities lending agreements, and resale agreements are subject to requirements that provide additional collateral in the event that market fluctuations result in declines in the value of collateral received. The Companys credit risk exposure related to loans to banking clients is actively managed through individual and portfolio reviews performed by management. Management regularly reviews asset quality including concentrations, delinquencies, non performing loans, losses, and recoveries. All are factors in the determination of an appropriate allowance for credit losses, which is reviewed quarterly by senior management. The Companys mortgage loan portfolios primarily include first lien 3 , 5 and 7 year adjustable rate residential mortgage loans (First Mortgage portfolio) of $3.7 billion and home equity lines of credit (HELOC portfolio) of $3.3 billion at December 31, 2009. The Companys First Mortgage portfolio underwriting requirements are generally consistent with the underwriting requirements in the secondary market for loan portfolios. The Companys guidelines include maximum loan to value (LTV) ratios, cash out limits, and minimum Fair Issac & Company (FICO) credit scores. The specific guidelines are dependent on the individual characteristics of a loan (for example, whether the property is a primary or secondary residence, whether the loan is for investment property, whether the loan is for an initial purchase of a home or refinance of an existing home, and whether the loan is conforming or jumbo). These credit underwriting standards have limited the exposure to the types of loans that experienced high foreclosures and loss rates elsewhere in the industry during 2009 and 2008. There have been no 32 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) significant changes to the LTV ratio or FICO credit score guidelines related to the Companys First Mortgage or HELOC portfolios during 2009. At December 31, 2009, the weighted average originated LTV ratios were 62% and 59% for the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, respectively, and the weighted average originated FICO credit scores were 760 and 767 for the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios, respectively. The Company does not offer loans that allow for negative amortization and does not originate or purchase subprime loans (generally defined as extensions of credit to borrowers with a FICO credit score of less than 620 at origination), unless the borrower has compensating credit factors. At December 31, 2009, approximately 2% of both the First Mortgage and HELOC portfolios consisted of loans to borrowers with FICO credit scores of less than 620. The following table presents certain of the Companys loan quality metrics as a percentage of total outstanding loans: December 31, 2009 2008 Loan delinquencies (1) 0.87 % 0.54 % Nonaccrual loans 0.46 % 0.13 % Allowance for credit losses 0.61 % 0.33 % (1) Loan delinquencies are defined as loans that are 30 days or more past due. The Company has exposure to credit risk associated with its securities available for sale and securities held to maturity portfolios, whose fair values totaled $22.1 billion and $6.9 billion at December 31, 2009, respectively. These portfolios include U.S. agency and non agency residential mortgage backed securities, U.S. agency notes, corporate debt securities, certificates of deposit, and asset backed securities. U.S. agency residential mortgage backed securities do not have explicit credit ratings, however management considers these to be of the highest credit quality and rating given the guarantee of principal and interest by the U.S. agencies. Included in non agency residential mortgage backed securities are securities collateralized by loans that are considered to be Prime (defined by the Company as loans to borrowers with a FICO credit score of 620 or higher at origination), and Alt A (defined by the Company as Prime loans with reduced documentation at origination). The table below presents the credit ratings for U.S. agency and non agency residential mortgage backed securities available for sale and securities held to maturity, including Prime and Alt A residential mortgage backed securities, by year of origination. In some instances securities have divergent ratings from Moodys, Fitch, or Standard & Poors. In these instances, the Company has used the lowest rating as of December 31, 2009, for purposes of presenting the table below. Residential mortgage backed securities, particularly Alt A securities, experienced deteriorating credit characteristics, including increased delinquencies and valuation pressure, in 2009. For a discussion of the impact of current market conditions on residential mortgage backed securities, see Current Market Environment. 33 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) AAA AA to A BBB BB or Lower Total AmortizedCost NetUnrealizedGain (Loss) AmortizedCost NetUnrealizedLoss AmortizedCost NetUnrealizedLoss AmortizedCost NetUnrealizedLoss AmortizedCost NetUnrealizedGain (Loss) U.S. agency residential mortgage backed securities: 2005 $ 584 $ 6 $ $ $ $ $ $ $ 584 $ 6 2006 390 1 390 1 2007 709 25 709 25 2008 4,360 129 4,360 129 2009 10,663 26 10,663 26 Total 16,706 187 16,706 187 Non agency residential mortgage backed securities: 2003 80 (7 ) 8 (1 ) 88 (8 ) 2004 134 (9 ) 84 (13 ) 9 (5 ) 227 (27 ) 2005 64 (6 ) 303 (37 ) 236 (50 ) 366 (91 ) 969 (184 ) 2006 13 37 (5 ) 644 (201 ) 694 (206 ) 2007 93 (4 ) 34 (5 ) 355 (85 ) 482 (94 ) Total 384 (26 ) 432 (56 ) 279 (60 ) 1,365 (377 ) 2,460 (519 ) Total residential mortgage backed securities $ 17,090 $ 161 $ 432 $ (56 ) $ 279 $ (60 ) $ 1,365 $ (377 ) $ 19,166 $ (332 ) % of Total residential mortgage backed securities 89 % 2 % 2 % 7 % 100 % At December 31, 2009, all of the corporate debt securities and non mortgage asset backed securities were rated investment grade (defined as a rating equivalent to a Moodys rating of Baa or higher, or a Standard & Poors rating of BBB or higher). Schwab performs clearing services for all securities transactions in its client accounts. Schwab has exposure to credit risk due to its obligation to settle transactions with clearing corporations, mutual funds, and other financial institutions even if Schwabs client or a counterparty fails to meet its obligations to Schwab. Concentration Risk The Company has exposure to concentration risk when holding large positions in financial instruments collateralized by assets with similar economic characteristics or in securities of a single issuer or industry. The fair value of the Companys investments in residential mortgage backed securities totaled $18.8 billion at December 31, 2009. Of these, $16.9 billion were U.S. agency securities and $1.9 billion were non agency securities. The U.S. agency securities are included in securities available for sale and securities held to maturity and the non agency securities are included in securities available for sale. Included in non agency residential mortgage backed securities are securities collateralized by Alt A loans. At December 31, 2009, the amortized cost and fair value of Alt A mortgage backed securities were $628 million and $387 million, respectively. The Companys investments in corporate debt securities and commercial paper totaled $5.6 billion at December 31, 2009, with the majority issued by institutions in the financial services industry. These securities are included in securities available for sale, securities held to maturity, cash and investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes, cash and cash equivalents, and other securities owned in the Companys consolidated balance sheets. Included in corporate debt securities and commercial paper at December 31, 2009, were $3.2 billion of securities issued by financial institutions and guaranteed under the FDIC Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program. The Companys loans to banking clients include $3.7 billion of first lien residential real estate mortgage loans at December 31, 2009. Approximately 75% of these mortgages consisted of loans with interest only payment terms. The interest 34 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) rates on approximately 75% of these interest only loans are not scheduled to reset for three or more years. The Companys interest only loans do not include interest terms described as temporary introductory rates below current market rates. At December 31, 2009, 39% of the residential real estate mortgages and 48% of the home equity lines of credit balances were secured by properties which are located in California. The Company also has exposure to concentration risk from its margin and securities lending activities collateralized by securities of a single issuer or industry. The Company has indirect exposure to U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral to secure its resale agreements. The Companys primary credit exposure on these resale transactions is with its counterparty. The Company would have exposure to the U.S. Government and agency securities only in the event of the counterpartys default on the resale agreements. U.S. Government and agency securities held as collateral for resale agreements totaled $8.5 billion at December 31, 2009. Market Risk Market risk is the potential for changes in revenue or the value of financial instruments held by the Company as a result of fluctuations in interest rates, equity prices or market conditions. For discussion of the Companys market risk, see Item 7A Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk. Fiduciary Risk Fiduciary risk is the potential for financial or reputational loss through breach of fiduciary duties to a client. Fiduciary activities include, but are not limited to, individual and institutional trust, investment management, custody, and cash and securities processing. The Company attempts to manage this risk by establishing procedures to ensure that obligations to clients are discharged faithfully and in compliance with applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Business units have the primary responsibility for adherence to the procedures applicable to their business. Guidance and control are provided through the creation, approval, and ongoing review of applicable policies by business units and various risk committees. Legal and Regulatory Risk The Company faces significant legal and compliance risk in its business, and the volume of litigation and regulatory proceedings against financial services firms and the amount of damages claimed have been increasing. Among other things, these risks relate to the suitability of client investments, conflicts of interest, disclosure obligations and performance expectations for Company products and services, supervision of employees, and the adequacy of the Companys controls. Claims against the Company may increase due to a variety of factors, such as if clients suffer losses during a period of deteriorating equity market conditions, as the Company increases the level of advice it provides to clients, and as the Company enhances the services it provides to IAs. In addition, the Company and its affiliates are subject to extensive regulation by federal, state and foreign regulatory authorities, and SROs, and such regulation is becoming increasingly extensive and complex. The Company attempts to manage legal and compliance risk through policies and procedures reasonably designed to avoid litigation claims and prevent or detect violations of applicable legal and regulatory requirements. These procedures address issues such as business conduct and ethics, sales and trading practices, marketing and communications, extension of credit, client funds and securities, books and records, anti money laundering, client privacy, employment policies, and contracts management. Despite the Companys efforts to maintain an effective compliance program and internal controls, legal breaches and rule violations could result in reputational harm, significant losses and disciplinary sanctions, including limitations on the Companys business activities. 35 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The Company uses fair value measurements to record certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value, and to determine fair value disclosures. At December 31, 2009, $30.1 billion, or 40% of total assets, were recorded at fair value. At December 31, 2008, $21.9 billion, or 42% of total assets, were recorded at fair value. All of these assets were measured at fair value using quoted prices or market based information and accordingly were classified as Level 1 or Level 2 measurements in accordance with the fair value hierarchy described in fair value measurement accounting guidance. Liabilities recorded at fair value were not material at December 31, 2009 or 2008. See note Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 15. Fair Value of Assets and Liabilities for more information on the Companys assets and liabilities accounted for at fair value. The Company uses prices obtained from an independent third party pricing service to measure the fair value of certain investment securities. The Company validates prices received from the pricing service using various methods including, comparison to prices received from additional pricing services, comparison to available quoted market prices, internal valuation models, and review of other relevant market data. The Company does not adjust the prices received from the independent third party pricing service unless such prices are inconsistent with the definition of fair value and result in a material difference in the recorded amounts. At December 31, 2009 and 2008, the Company did not adjust prices received from the independent third party pricing service. For certificates of deposits and treasury securities included in investments segregated and on deposit for regulatory purposes, the Company uses discounted cash flow models to measure the fair value that utilize market based inputs including observable market interest rates that correspond to the remaining maturities or next interest reset dates. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. While the majority of the Companys revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are not based on estimates, there are certain accounting principles that require management to make estimates regarding matters that are uncertain and susceptible to change where such change may result in a material adverse impact on the Companys financial position and reported financial results. These critical accounting estimates are described below. Management regularly reviews the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the Companys financial statements for reasonableness and adequacy. Other than Temporary Impairment of Securities Available for Sale and Securities Held to Maturity: Management evaluates whether securities available for sale and securities held to maturity are other than temporarily impaired (OTTI) on a quarterly basis. Debt securities with unrealized losses are considered OTTI if the Company intends to sell the security or if the Company will be required to sell such security prior to any anticipated recovery. If management determines that a security is OTTI under these circumstances, the impairment recognized in earnings is measured as the entire difference between the amortized cost and then current fair value. A security is also OTTI if management does not expect to recover the amortized cost of the security. In this circumstance, management utilizes cash flow models to estimate the expected future cash flow from the securities and to estimate the credit loss. The impairment recognized in earnings is measured by the difference between the present value of expected cash flows and the amortized cost of the security. Expected cash flows are discounted using the securitys effective interest rate. The evaluation of whether the Company expects to recover the amortized cost of a security is inherently judgmental. The evaluation includes the assessment of several bond performance indicators including: the portion of the underlying loans that are delinquent (30 days, 60 days, 90+ days), in bankruptcy, in foreclosure or converted to real estate owned; the actual amount of loss incurred on the underlying loans in which the property has been foreclosed and sold; the amount of credit support provided by the structure of the security available to absorb credit losses on the underlying loans; the current credit ratings issued by either Standard & Poors, Fitch Ratings, or Moodys; the current price and magnitude of the unrealized loss; and whether the Company has received all scheduled principal and interest payments. Management uses cash flow models to further assess the likelihood of other than temporary impairment for the Companys non agency residential mortgage backed 36 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) securities. To develop the cash flow models, the Company uses forecasted loss severity, prepayment speeds (i.e. the rate at which the principal on underlying loans are paid down), and default rates over the securities remaining maturities. Forecasted home price fluctuations are an important variable in forecasting the expected loss severity and default rates. Based on these cash flow projections, management determines if the Company expects to recover all of the amortized cost of the securities and therefore if the securities are OTTI. Valuation of Goodwill: The Company tests goodwill for impairment at least annually, or whenever indications of impairment exist. An impairment exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value, resulting in an impairment charge for this excess. The Company has elected April 1st as its annual goodwill impairment testing date. In testing for a potential impairment of goodwill on April 1, 2009, management estimated the fair value of each of the Companys reporting units (generally defined as the Companys businesses for which financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management) and compared this value to the carrying value of the reporting unit. The estimated fair value of each reporting unit substantially exceeded its carrying value, and therefore management concluded that no amount of goodwill was impaired. The estimated fair value of the reporting units was established using a discounted cash flow model that includes significant assumptions about the future operating results and cash flows of each reporting unit. Adverse changes in the Companys planned business operations such as unanticipated competition, a loss of key personnel, the sale of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit, or other unforeseen developments could result in an impairment of the Companys recorded goodwill. Allowance for Credit Losses: The adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is reviewed regularly by management, taking into consideration current economic conditions, the existing loan portfolio composition, past loss experience, and risks inherent in the portfolio, as more fully described below. The Company performs a quarterly analysis to estimate the allowance for credit losses. This process utilizes loan level statistical models that estimate prepayments, defaults, and expected life of loan losses for our loan portfolios based on predicted behavior of individual loans within the portfolios. The models consider effects of borrower behavior and a variety of factors including, but not limited to, interest rate fluctuations, housing price movements, current economic conditions, estimated defaults and foreclosures, delinquencies, the loan portfolio composition (including concentrations of credit risk), past loss experience, estimates of loss severity, and credit scores. The more significant variables within the models include a measure of delinquency roll rates, the amount of loss in the event of default, housing prices, and interest rates. Delinquency roll rates (i.e., the rates at which loans transition through delinquency stages and ultimately result in a loss) are estimated from the Companys historical loss experience adjusted for current trends and market information. Loss in the event of default is based on the Companys historical loss experience and market trends. Housing price trends are derived from historical home price indices and statistical forecasts of future home values. Factors affecting the home price index include: housing inventory, unemployment, interest rates, and inflation expectations. Interest rate projections are based on the current term structure of interest rates and historical volatilities to project various possible future interest rate paths. This quarterly analysis results in a loss factor that is applied to the outstanding balances to determine the allowance for credit loss for each loan category. Legal Reserve: Reserves for legal and regulatory claims and proceedings reflect an estimate of probable losses for each matter, after considering, among other factors, the progress of the case, prior experience and the experience of others in similar cases, available defenses, insurance coverage and indemnification, and the opinions and views of legal counsel. In many cases, including most class action lawsuits, it is not possible to determine whether a loss will be incurred, or to estimate the range of that loss, until the matter is close to resolution, in which case no accrual is made until that time. Reserves are adjusted as more information becomes available or when an event occurs requiring a change. Significant judgment is required in making these estimates, and the actual cost of resolving a matter may ultimately differ materially from the amount reserved. The Companys management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee. Additionally, management has reviewed with the Audit Committee the Companys significant estimates discussed in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations. 37 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS In addition to historical information, this Annual Report on Form 10 K contains forward looking statements within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
