Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Management of the Company focuses on several key financial and non financial metrics in evaluating the Companys financial position and operating performance. All information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10 K is presented on a continuing operations basis unless otherwise noted. Summarized results for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008 are shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate1 Year2009 2010 2010 2009 2008 Client Activity Metrics: Net new client assets (1) (in billions) (70 %) $ 26.6 $ 87.3 $ 113.4 Client assets (in billions, at year end) 11 % $ 1,574.5 $ 1,422.6 $ 1,137.0 Clients daily average trades (2) (in thousands) (4 %) 399.7 414.8 432.1 Company Financial Metrics: Net revenues 1 % $ 4,248 $ 4,193 $ 5,150 Expenses excluding interest 19 % 3,469 2,917 3,122 Income from continuing operations before taxes on income (39 %) 779 1,276 2,028 Taxes on income (34 %) (325 ) (489 ) (798 ) Income from continuing operations (42 %) 454 787 1,230 Loss from discontinued operations, net of tax (18 ) Net income (42 %) $ 454 $ 787 $ 1,212 Earnings per share from continuing operations diluted (44 %) $ .38 $ .68 $ 1.06 Earnings per share diluted (44 %) $ .38 $ .68 $ 1.05 Net revenue growth (decline) from prior year 1 % (19 %) 3 % Pre tax profit margin from continuing operations 18.3 % 30.4 % 39.4 % Return on stockholders equity 8 % 17 % 31 % Net revenue per average full time equivalent employee (in thousands) $ 337 $ 338 $ 383 (1) Includes net outflows of $51.5 billion in 2010 related to the planned deconversion of a mutual fund clearing services client. (2) Beginning in 2010, amounts include all commission free trades, including the Companys Mutual Fund OneSource&reg; funds and ETFs, and other proprietary products. Prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this change. Net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows. Management believes that this metric depicts how well the Companys products and services appeal to new and existing clients in a given operating environment. Client assets is the market value of all client assets housed at the Company. Management considers client assets to be indicative of the Companys appeal in the marketplace. Additionally, fluctuations in certain components of client assets (e.g., Mutual Fund OneSource funds) directly impact asset management and administration fees. Clients daily average trades is an indicator of client engagement with securities markets and the most prominent driver of trading revenue. Management believes that earnings per share, net revenue growth, pre tax profit margin from continuing operations, and return on stockholders equity provide broad indicators of the Companys overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns within the context of a given operating environment. Net revenue per average full time equivalent employee is considered by management to be the Companys broadest measure of productivity. 16 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The Companys major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. The Company generates asset management and administration fees through its proprietary and third party mutual fund offerings, as well as fee based investment management and advisory services. Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue are impacted by securities valuations, interest rates, the Companys ability to attract new clients, and client activity levels. The Company generates trading revenue through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenue from trading activity in fixed income securities. Trading revenue is impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of prices in the equity and fixed income markets, and commission rates. 2010 Compared to 2009 The equity markets improved during 2010 and remained well above their prior year lows. The Nasdaq Composite Index, the Standard & Poors 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 17%, 13%, and 11%, respectively. The three month LIBOR increased by 5 basis points to .30% in 2010, however the low interest rate environment continued throughout the year as the federal funds target rate remained unchanged during the year at a range of zero to 0.25%. The Companys sustained investment in expanding and improving product and service capabilities for its clients was reflected in the strength of its key client activity metrics in 2010 net new client assets totaled $78.1 billion, excluding outflows related to a single Mutual Fund Clearing client who completed a planned transfer to an internal platform during the year, and total client assets ended 2010 at a record $1.57 trillion, up 11% from 2009. Client trading activity slowed during the year as clients daily average trades decreased 4% from 2009 to 399,700. Net revenues were relatively flat in 2010 from 2009. However, the Company experienced a change in the mix of its revenue sources as the increase in net interest revenue was offset by decreases in trading revenue, asset management and administration fees, and other revenue. Net interest revenue increased due to higher average balances of interest earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the average yield earned. Trading revenue decreased due to lower average revenue per revenue trade resulting from improved online trade pricing for clients, which was implemented in January 2010, and slightly lower daily average revenue trades in 2010. While the low interest rate environment caused over $200 million of additional money market mutual fund fee waivers from the prior year, the decrease in asset management and administration fees was limited to 3% due to higher average asset valuations and continued asset inflows. Other revenue was lower in comparison to 2009 due to a gain of $31 million on the repurchase of a portion of the Companys long term debt in 2009. Expenses excluding interest increased by 19% in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to the recognition of certain significant charges in 2010. The Company recognized class action litigation and regulatory reserves and other costs totaling $320 million relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund&reg;. Additionally, the Company decided to cover the net remaining losses recognized by Schwab money market mutual funds as a result of their investments in a single structured investment vehicle that defaulted in 2008 and recorded a charge of $132 million in 2010. Also, as a result of challenging credit card industry economics, the Company ended its sponsorship in its Invest First&reg; and WorldPoints(a) Visa(b) credit cards and recorded a charge of $30 million. The Companys ongoing expense discipline helped limit the growth in all other expense categories in the aggregate to 3% over the prior year. 2009 Compared to 2008 Economic and market conditions were challenging throughout 2009, marked by unprecedented market dynamics including declines in short term interest rates and home valuations, increases in home foreclosures and delinquencies, and tight credit markets. While the federal funds target rate was unchanged at a range of zero to 0.25%, the three month LIBOR decreased by 158 basis points to 0.25%. At the same time, although the equity markets showed sustained improvement from their March (a) WorldPoints is a registered trademark of FIA Card Services, N.A.

The Company attracted $87.3 billion in net new client assets during 2009 and total client assets were $1.42 trillion at December 31, 2009, up 25% from the prior year, reflecting the Companys success in attracting and retaining clients. Client trading activity slowed modestly during 2009 as clients daily average trades decreased 4% to 414,800 from 2008. Net revenues decreased by 19% in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to the decreases in asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue. Asset management and administration fees decreased in 2009 primarily due to money market mutual fund fee waivers of $224 million and lower average equity market valuations. There were no money market mutual fund fee waivers in 2008. Net interest revenue decreased as a result of the low interest rate environment, partially offset by higher average balances of interest earning assets. These decreases were offset by the increase in other revenue. Other revenue in 2009 included a $31 million gain on the repurchase of a portion of the Companys long term debt. In addition, other revenue in 2008 included a loss of $29 million on the sale of a corporate debt security held in the Companys available for sale portfolio. Net revenues were also negatively impacted by net impairment charges of $60 million in 2009 relating to certain residential mortgage backed securities in the Companys available for sale portfolio. Net impairment losses on securities in 2008 included an other than temporary impairment charge of $44 million related to a corporate debt security held in the Companys available for sale portfolio. Expenses excluding interest decreased by 7% in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to the decreases in compensation and benefits, professional services, and advertising and market development expenses. The decrease in expenses was partially offset by severance and facilities charges of $101 million relating to the Companys cost reduction measures and a $16 million FDIC special industry assessment. As a result of the Companys cost reduction measures and expense discipline, the Company achieved a pre tax profit margin from continuing operations of 30.4% and return on stockholders equity of 17% in 2009. Net revenue per average full time equivalent employee was $338,000 in 2009, down 12% from 2008 due to lower net revenues, partially offset by the decrease in average full time equivalent employees. Certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. All references to EPS information in this Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations reflect diluted EPS unless otherwise noted. Business Acquisition On November 9, 2010, the Company completed its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of Windward for $106 million in common stock and $44 million in cash. Windward was an investment advisory firm that managed diversified investment portfolios comprised primarily of ETFs. CURRENT MARKET AND REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT While the equity markets improved from their March 2009 lows, which helped to strengthen the Companys net revenues in 2010, the interest rate environment remains challenging and may continue to constrain the Companys net revenues. Short term interest rates remained at historically low levels in 2010, as the federal funds target rate was unchanged at a range of zero to 0.25%, and the three month and six month LIBOR were below year earlier levels for the majority of the year. To the extent rates remain at these low levels, the Companys net interest revenue will continue to be constrained. The low rate environment also affects asset management and administration fees. The overall yields on certain Schwab sponsored money market mutual funds have fallen to levels at or below the management fees the Company earns on those funds. The Company continues to waive a portion of its management fees, which it began to do in the first quarter of 2009, so that the funds may continue providing a positive return to clients. These and other money market mutual funds may continue to find it necessary 18 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) to replace maturing securities with low yielding securities and the overall yield on such funds may remain below the management fees on those funds. To the extent this occurs, fees may continue to be waived and could increase from the fourth quarter 2010 level, which would negatively affect asset management and administration fees. The Company recorded net impairment charges of $36 million and $60 million related to certain non agency residential mortgage backed securities in 2010 and 2009, respectively, due to credit deterioration of the securities underlying collateral. Further deterioration in the performance of the underlying loans in the Companys residential mortgage backed securities portfolio could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges. The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law in July 2010. Among other things, the legislation authorizes various assessments and fees and requires the establishment of minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements for insured depository institutions. CSC is continuing to review the impact the legislation, studies and related rule making will have on the Companys business, financial condition, and results of operations. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion presents an analysis of the Companys results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2010, 2009, and 2008. Net Revenues The Companys major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. Asset management and administration fees and trading revenue decreased, while net interest revenue increased in 2010 as compared to 2009. Asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue decreased in 2009 as compared to 2008.

The Company earns mutual fund service fees for shareholder services, administration, investment management, and transfer agent services (through July 2009) provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third party funds. These fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in the Companys proprietary funds and third party funds. The Company also earns asset management fees for advisory and managed account services, which are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third party mutual funds are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data. Asset management and administration fees may vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees, see Current Market and Regulatory Environment. Asset management and administration fees decreased by $53 million, or 3%, in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to the decrease in mutual fund service fees, partially offset by an increase in investment management and trust fees. Asset management and administration fees decreased by $480 million, or 20%, in 2009 from 2008 due to decreases in mutual fund service fees and investment management and trust fees. Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate2009 2010 2010 2009 2008 Asset management and administration fees before money market mutual fund fee waivers 7 % $ 2,255 $ 2,099 $ 2,355 Money market mutual fund fee waivers 93 % (433 ) (224 ) Asset management and administration fees (3 %) $ 1,822 $ 1,875 $ 2,355 Mutual fund service fees decreased by $169 million, or 11%, in 2010 from 2009 and by $414 million, or 22%, in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to money market mutual fund fee waivers. Given the low interest rate environment in 2010 and 2009, the overall yields on certain Schwab sponsored money market mutual funds have fallen to levels at or below the management fees on those funds. As a result, the Company waived a portion of its fees in 2010 and 2009, in order to provide a positive return to clients. There were no money market mutual fund fee waivers in 2008. The decrease in mutual fund service fees in 2010 was partially offset by the effect of higher average balances of client assets invested in the Companys Mutual Fund OneSource funds as a result of higher average asset valuations and continued asset inflows. The decrease in mutual fund service fees in 2009 was also due to lower average balances of client assets invested in the Companys Mutual Fund OneSource funds and mutual fund clearing services as a result of lower average equity market valuations. Investment management and trust fees increased by $104 million, or 38%, in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to higher average balances of client assets participating in advisory and managed account services programs. This increase was partially offset by temporary fees rebates of $63 million offered to qualifying clients that participated in those programs. Investment management and trust fees decreased by $67 million, or 20%, in 2009 from 2008 due to temporary fee rebates relating to the same programs discussed previously. Net Interest Revenue Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies. The Company is positioned so that the consolidated balance sheet produces an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest earning assets generally reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities). When interest rates fall, the Company may attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock in asset yields as well as by lowering rates paid to clients on interest bearing liabilities. Since the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients, as well as the rates charged on receivables from brokerage clients, and also controls the composition of its investment securities, it has 20 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) some ability to manage its net interest spread. However, the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on net interest revenue, see Current Market and Regulatory Environment. In clearing its clients trades, Schwab holds cash balances payable to clients. In most cases, Schwab pays its clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment, and may invest these funds and earn interest revenue. Receivables from brokerage clients consist primarily of margin loans to brokerage clients. Margin loans are loans made by Schwab to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities. Pursuant to SEC regulations, client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients, which are recorded in cash and investments segregated on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. When investing segregated client cash balances, Schwab must adhere to SEC regulations that restrict investments to securities guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, participation certificates, mortgage backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, certificates of deposit issued by U.S. banks and thrifts, and resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities. Additionally, Schwab has established policies for the minimum credit quality and maximum maturity of these investments. Schwab Bank also maintains investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funding from deposits raised in excess of loans to banking clients. Schwab Banks securities available for sale include residential mortgage backed securities, U.S. agency notes, asset backed securities, corporate debt securities, and certificates of deposit. Schwab Banks securities held to maturity include residential mortgage backed securities, asset backed securities, and corporate debt securities. Schwab Bank lends funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans and HELOCs. These loans are largely funded by interest bearing deposits from banking clients. The Companys interest earning assets are financed primarily by brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients. Noninterest bearing funding sources include noninterest bearing brokerage client cash balances and proceeds from stock lending activities, as well as stockholders equity. 21 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The following table presents net interest revenue information corresponding to interest earning assets and funding sources on the consolidated balance sheet: Year Ended December 31, 2010 2009 2008 AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate AverageBalance InterestRevenue/Expense AverageYield/Rate Interest earning assets: Cash and cash equivalents $ 7,269 $ 19 0.26 % $ 7,848 $ 33 0.42 % $ 5,217 $ 129 2.47 % Cash and investments segregated 19,543 57 0.29 % 16,291 80 0.49 % 11,223 280 2.49 % Broker related receivables (1) 317 0.08 % 363 1 0.28 % 428 8 1.87 % Receivables from brokerage clients 8,981 437 4.87 % 6,749 351 5.20 % 10,278 612 5.95 % Other securities owned (2) 74 0.45 % 126 1 0.79 % Securities available for sale (3) 24,209 486 2.01 % 18,558 521 2.81 % 11,772 517 4.39 % Securities held to maturity 10,440 361 3.46 % 1,915 74 3.86 % 22 1 5.86 % Loans to banking clients 7,987 275 3.44 % 6,671 241 3.61 % 4,831 227 4.70 % Loans held for sale 80 4 5.00 % 110 5 4.55 % 66 4 6.06 % Total interest earning assets 78,900 1,639 2.08 % 58,631 1,307 2.23 % 43,837 1,778 4.06 % Other interest revenue 84 121 130 Total interest earning assets $ 78,900 $ 1,723 2.18 % $ 58,631 $ 1,428 2.44 % $ 43,837 $ 1,908 4.35 % Funding sources: Deposits from banking clients $ 44,858 $ 105 0.23 % $ 31,249 $ 107 0.34 % $ 19,203 $ 104 0.54 % Payables to brokerage clients 22,715 2 0.01 % 18,002 3 0.02 % 15,220 55 0.36 % Short term borrowings 40 1 2.54 % Long term debt 1,648 92 5.58 % 1,231 71 5.77 % 890 59 6.63 % Total interest bearing liabilities 69,221 199 0.29 % 50,482 181 0.36 % 35,353 219 0.62 % Noninterest bearing funding sources 9,679 8,149 8,484 Other interest expense 2 7 Total funding sources $ 78,900 $ 199 0.25 % $ 58,631 $ 183 0.32 % $ 43,837 $ 226 0.51 % Net interest revenue $ 1,524 1.93 % $ 1,245 2.12 % $ 1,682 3.84 % (1) Includes receivables from brokers, dealers, and clearing organizations. Interest revenue on broker related receivables was less than $500,000 in 2010. (2) Interest revenue on other securities owned was less than $500,000 in 2010. (3) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost. Net interest revenue increased in 2010 from 2009 due to higher average balances of interest earning assets. This resulted from significant growth in the average balance of deposits from banking clients, which in turn funded increases in the average balances of securities held to maturity, securities available for sale, and loans to banking clients. These interest earning assets are invested at rates above the cost of supporting funding sources. The increase in net interest revenue was partially offset by the low interest rate environment that persisted in 2010, which resulted in the decline in the yields of almost all interest earning assets compared to 2009. Net interest revenue decreased in 2009 from 2008 due to the low interest rate environment in 2009. As a result, the Company experienced declines in the yields and rates of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities compared to 2008, with yields on interest earning assets declining more than the cost of funding sources as short term interest rates approached zero. The mix of interest earning assets also negatively affected net interest revenue most notably the decrease in the average balance of margin loans resulted in a higher average balance of cash and investments segregated, a lower yielding asset category. The effect of the low interest rate environment and asset mix was partially offset by the growth in average balances. The Company experienced significant growth in deposits from banking clients, which in turn funded increases in the average balances of securities available for sale, loans to banking clients, and cash and cash equivalents. Trading Revenue Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenue is affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from client fixed income securities trading activity. Factors that influence principal transaction revenue include the volume of client trades and market price volatility. 22 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) Trading revenue decreased by $166 million, or 17%, in 2010 from 2009 and by $84 million, or 8%, in 2009 from 2008 due to lower average revenue per revenue trade resulting from improved online trade pricing for clients and lower daily average revenue trades, as trading volume and market volatility eased from 2008 levels. As shown in the following table, daily average revenue trades decreased 5% in 2010. The decrease was primarily due to lower volumes of equity and principal transaction trades, partially offset by a higher volume of option trades. Average revenue per revenue trade decreased 11% in 2010, primarily due to lower online equity trade commissions, which were implemented in January 2010. Daily average revenue trades decreased 2% in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower volumes of principal transaction and mutual fund trades. Average revenue per revenue trade decreased 5% in 2009 from 2008 primarily due to lower average revenue per revenue trade for principal transactions and mutual funds, partially offset by higher average revenue per revenue trade for option securities.

Other Revenue Other revenue includes gains on the repurchases of long term debt, realized gains and losses on sales of securities available for sale, gains and losses on sales of loans held for sale, service fees, and software maintenance fees. Other revenue decreased by $40 million, or 23%, in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a gain of $31 million on the repurchase of a portion of the Companys long term debt in 2009. Other revenue increased by $81 million, or 86%, in 2009 compared to 2008 primarily due to the gain on the repurchase of long term debt in 2009 previously discussed and a realized loss of $29 million on the sale of a corporate debt security in 2008. Provision for Loan Losses The provision for loan losses decreased by $11 million, or 29%, in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to stabilization in the levels of loan delinquencies and nonaccrual loans in 2010 compared to 2009, partially offset by growth in the Companys residential real estate mortgage and HELOC portfolios. The provision for loan losses increased by $21 million, or 124%, in 2009 from 2008, primarily due to higher loan delinquencies and nonaccrual loans, as well as growth in the Companys loan portfolio. Charge offs were $20 million, $13 million, and $4 million in 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.
