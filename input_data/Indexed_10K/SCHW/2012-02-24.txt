Item 7. Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations OVERVIEW Management of the Company focuses on several key financial and client activity metrics in evaluating the Companys financial position and operating performance. Results for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 are shown in the following table: Year Ended December 31, Growth Rate1 Year2010 2011 2011 2010 2009 Client Activity Metrics: Net new client assets (1) (in billions) N/M $ 145.9 $ 26.6 $ 87.3 Client assets (in billions, at year end) 7 % $ 1,677.7 $ 1,574.5 $ 1,422.6 Clients daily average trades (2) (in thousands) 13 % 451.1 399.7 414.8 Company Financial Metrics: Net revenues 10 % $ 4,691 $ 4,248 $ 4,193 Expenses excluding interest (5 %) 3,299 3,469 2,917 Income before taxes on income 79 % 1,392 779 1,276 Taxes on income 62 % (528 ) (325 ) (489 ) Net income 90 % $ 864 $ 454 $ 787 Earnings per share diluted 84 % $ .70 $ .38 $ .68 Net revenue growth (decline) from prior year 10 % 1 % (19 %) Pre tax profit margin 29.7 % 18.3 % 30.4 % Return on stockholders equity 12 % 8 % 17 % Net revenue per average full time equivalent employee (in thousands) 4 % $ 350 $ 337 $ 338 (1) Includes inflows of $56.1 billion and $7.5 billion in 2011 from a mutual fund clearing services client and the acquisition of optionsXpress, respectively. Includes net outflows of $51.5 billion in 2010 related to the planned deconversion of a mutual fund clearing services client. (2) Beginning in 2010, amounts include all commission free trades, including the Companys Mutual Fund OneSource&reg; funds and ETFs, and other proprietary products. Prior period amounts have been recast to reflect this change. N/M Not meaningful. Net new client assets is defined as the total inflows of client cash and securities to the firm less client outflows. Management believes that this metric depicts how well the Companys products and services appeal to new and existing clients in a given operating environment. Client assets is the market value of all client assets custodied at the Company. Management considers client assets to be indicative of the Companys appeal in the marketplace. Additionally, fluctuations in certain components of client assets (e.g., Mutual Fund OneSource funds) directly impact asset management and administration fees. Clients daily average trades is an indicator of client engagement with securities markets and the most prominent driver of trading revenue. Management believes that earnings per share, net revenue growth, pre tax profit margin, and return on stockholders equity provide broad indicators of the Companys overall financial health, operating efficiency, and ability to generate acceptable returns within the context of a given operating environment. Net revenue per average full time equivalent employee is considered by management to be the Companys broadest measure of productivity. The Companys major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue. The Company generates asset management and administration fees through its proprietary and third party 17 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) mutual fund offerings, as well as fee based advisory solutions. Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Asset management and administration fees and net interest revenue are impacted by securities valuations, interest rates, the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing funding sources, the Companys ability to attract new clients, and client activity levels. The Company generates trading revenue through commissions earned for executing trades for clients and principal transaction revenue from trading activity in fixed income securities. Trading revenue is impacted by trading volumes, the volatility of prices in the equity and fixed income markets, and commission rates. 2011 Compared to 2010 Economic and market conditions were challenging throughout 2011, marked by volatility in the equity markets, lower market valuations, and further declines in interest rates. The Standard and Poors 500 Index, Nasdaq Composite Index, and Dow Jones Industrial Average decreased on average 6%, 5%, and 4%, respectively, between the first and second halves of the year. The federal funds target rate remained unchanged during the year at a range of zero to 0.25% and the three month Treasury Bill and 10 year Treasury yields declined by 11 and 141 basis points to 0.01% and 1.88%, respectively. The Companys key client activity metrics in 2011 were stable in the midst of a weakened economic and market environment. Net new client assets totaled $145.9 billion in 2011. Core net new client assets, which exclude significant one time flows, totaled $82.3 billion in 2011 up from $78.1 billion in 2010. Total client assets ended the year at $1.68 trillion, up 7% from 2010. In addition, clients daily average trades were 451,100, up 13% from 2010. Net revenues increased by 10% in 2011 from 2010 due to increases in all of the Companys major sources of net revenues. Asset management and administration fees increased primarily due to an increase in revenue from the Companys advice solutions and continued asset inflows, partially offset by money market mutual fund fee waivers, which increased to $568 million in 2011 from $433 million in 2010. Net interest revenue increased primarily due to higher average balances of interest earning assets during the year, partially offset by the effect of lower interest rate spreads resulting from higher amortization of premiums relating to residential mortgage backed securities caused by higher mortgage prepayments in 2011. Trading revenue increased primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and the addition of optionsXpress, which was acquired in September 2011. While total expenses excluding interest were lower by 5% in 2011 compared to 2010, the Company experienced increases in compensation and benefits, professional services, occupancy and equipment, and advertising and market development expenses in aggregate of $266 million in 2011 compared to 2010. Significant charges in 2010 included class action litigation and regulatory reserves relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund&reg;, losses recognized for Schwab money market mutual funds, and a charge relating to the termination of the Companys Invest First&reg; and WorldPoints(a) Visa(b) credit card program for a total of $482 million. As a result of the Companys ongoing investment in clients and sustained expense discipline, the Company achieved a pre tax profit margin of 29.7% and return on stockholders equity of 12% in 2011. 2010 Compared to 2009 The equity markets improved during 2010 and remained well above their prior year lows. The Nasdaq Composite Index, the Standard & Poors 500 Index, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average increased 17%, 13%, and 11%, respectively. The low interest rate environment continued throughout the year as the federal funds target rate remained unchanged during the year at a range of zero to 0.25%. The Companys sustained investment in expanding and improving product and service capabilities for its clients was reflected in the strength of its key client activity metrics in 2010 net new client assets totaled $78.1 billion, excluding (a) WorldPoints is a registered trademark of FIA Card Services, N.A.

Client trading activity slowed during the year as clients daily average trades decreased 4% from 2009 to 399,700. Net revenues were relatively flat in 2010 from 2009. The Company, however, experienced a change in the mix of its revenue sources as the increase in net interest revenue was offset by decreases in trading revenue, asset management and administration fees, and other revenue. Net interest revenue increased due to higher average balances of interest earning assets, partially offset by a decrease in the average yield earned. Trading revenue decreased due to lower average revenue per revenue trade resulting from improved online trade pricing for clients, which was implemented in January 2010, and slightly lower daily average revenue trades in 2010. While the low interest rate environment caused over $200 million of additional money market mutual fund fee waivers from the prior year, the decrease in asset management and administration fees was limited to 3% due to higher average asset valuations and continued asset inflows. Other revenue was lower in comparison to 2009 primarily due to a gain of $31 million on the repurchase of a portion of the Companys long term debt in 2009. Expenses excluding interest were higher by 19% in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to the recognition of certain significant charges in 2010. The Company recognized class action litigation and regulatory reserves of $320 million relating to the Schwab YieldPlus Fund. Additionally, the Company decided to cover the net remaining losses recognized by Schwab money market mutual funds as a result of their investments in a single structured investment vehicle that defaulted in 2008 and recorded a charge of $132 million in 2010. Also, as a result of challenging credit card industry economics, the Company ended its sponsorship in its Invest First&reg; and WorldPoints(a) Visa(b ) credit cards and recorded a charge of $30 million. The Companys ongoing expense discipline helped limit the growth in all other expense categories in the aggregate to 3% over the prior year. Business Acquisitions On September 1, 2011, the Company completed its acquisition of all of the outstanding common shares of optionsXpress, an online brokerage firm primarily focused on equity option securities and futures, for total consideration of $714 million. Under the terms of the merger agreement, optionsXpress&reg; stockholders received 1.02 shares of the Companys common stock for each share of optionsXpress stock. As a result, the Company issued 59 million shares of the Companys common stock valued at $710 million, based on the closing price of the Companys common stock on September 1, 2011. The Company also assumed optionsXpress stock based compensation awards valued at $4 million. On November 9, 2010, the Company acquired substantially all of the assets of Windward for $106 million in common stock and $44 million in cash. Windward was an investment advisory firm that managed diversified investment portfolios comprised primarily of ETFs. For more information on the acquisitions of optionsXpress and Windward, see Item 8 Financial Statements and Supplementary Data Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 3. Business Acquisitions. Subsequent Event On January 26, 2012, the Company issued and sold 400,000 shares of fixed to floating rate non cumulative perpetual preferred stock, Series A, $0.01 par value, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (Series A Preferred Stock). The Series A Preferred Stock has a fixed dividend rate of 7% until 2022 and a floating rate thereafter. Net proceeds received from the sale were $394 million and are being used for general corporate purposes, including, without limitation, to support the Companys balance sheet growth and the potential migration of certain client cash balances to deposit accounts at Schwab Bank.

Further declines in interest rates continue to constrain growth in the Companys net revenues. While the federal funds target rate was unchanged at a range of zero to 0.25% in 2011, the Federal Reserve took action during the middle of the year to lower longer term interest rates. Further declines in interest rates in 2011 have accelerated the prepayment activity in the Companys portfolios of residential mortgage backed securities, which resulted in higher premium amortization. To the extent rates remain at these low levels, the Companys net interest revenue will continue to be constrained, even as growth in average balances helps to increase such revenue. The low interest rate environment also affects asset management and administration fees. The overall yields on certain Schwab sponsored money market mutual funds have remained at levels at or below the management fees on those funds. The Company continues to waive a portion of its management fees, which it began in the first quarter of 2009, so that the funds can continue providing a positive return to clients. These and other money market mutual funds may not be able to replace maturing securities with securities of equal or higher yields. As a result, the yields on such funds may remain around or decline from their current levels, and therefore below the management fees on those funds. To the extent this occurs, the Company may continue to waive fees and such waivers could increase from the fourth quarter 2011 level, which would negatively affect asset management and administration fees. The Company recorded net impairment charges of $31 million and $36 million related to certain non agency residential mortgage backed securities in 2011 and 2010, respectively, due to credit deterioration of the securities underlying loans. Further deterioration in the performance of the underlying loans in the Companys residential mortgage backed securities portfolio could result in the recognition of additional impairment charges. The Company is pursuing lawsuits in state court in San Francisco for rescission and damages against issuers, underwriters, and dealers of 51 individual non agency residential mortgage backed securities on which the Company has experienced realized and unrealized losses. The lawsuits allege that offering documents for the securities contained material untrue and misleading statements about the securities and the underwriting standards and credit quality of the underlying loans. On January 27, 2012, the court denied defendants motions to dismiss the claims with respect to all but 4 of the 51 securities, and allowed the cases to proceed to discovery. The Dodd Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act was signed into law in July 2010. Among other things, the legislation authorizes various assessments and fees and requires the establishment of minimum leverage and risk based capital requirements for insured depository institutions. The legislation also eliminated the Office of Thrift Supervision effective July 21, 2011 and, as a result, the Federal Reserve became CSCs primary regulator and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency became the primary regulator of Schwab Bank. CSC is continuing to review the impact the legislation, studies and related rule making will have on the Companys business, financial condition, and results of operations. 20 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following discussion presents an analysis of the Companys results of operations for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009. Net Revenues The Companys major sources of net revenues are asset management and administration fees, net interest revenue, and trading revenue, which all increased in 2011 as compared to 2010. Asset management and administration fees and trading revenue decreased, while net interest revenue increased in 2010 as compared to 2009. $4,691 $4,691 $4,691 $4,691 $4,691 $4,691 $4,691 Year Ended December 31, 2011 2010 2009 Growth Rate2010 2011 Amount % ofTotal NetRevenues Amount % ofTotal NetRevenues Amount % ofTotal NetRevenues Asset management and administration fees Schwab money market funds before fee waivers $ 865 $ 865 $ 1,011 Fee waivers 31 % (568 ) (433 ) (224 ) Schwab money market funds after fee waivers (31 %) 297 6 % 432 10 % 787 18 % Equity and bond funds 4 % 118 3 % 114 3 % 108 3 % Mutual Fund OneSource&reg; 12 % 680 14 % 608 14 % 446 11 % Total mutual funds 5 % 1,095 23 % 1,154 27 % 1,341 32 % Advice solutions 36 % 522 11 % 384 9 % 278 7 % Other 10 % 311 7 % 284 7 % 256 6 % Asset management and administration fees 6 % 1,928 41 % 1,822 43 % 1,875 45 % Net interest revenue Interest revenue 10 % 1,900 41 % 1,723 41 % 1,428 34 % Interest expense (12 %) (175 ) (4 %) (199 ) (5 %) (183 ) (4 %) Net interest revenue 13 % 1,725 37 % 1,524 36 % 1,245 30 % Trading revenue Commissions 12 % 866 19 % 770 18 % 884 21 % Principal transactions 2 % 61 1 % 60 2 % 112 3 % Trading revenue 12 % 927 20 % 830 20 % 996 24 % Other 19 % 160 3 % 135 3 % 175 3 % Provision for loan losses (33 %) (18 ) (27 ) (1 %) (38 ) (1 %) Net impairment losses on securities (14 %) (31 ) (1 %) (36 ) (1 %) (60 ) (1 %) Total net revenues 10 % $ 4,691 100 % $ 4,248 100 % $ 4,193 100 % Asset Management and Administration Fees Asset management and administration fees include mutual fund service fees and fees for other asset based financial services provided to individual and institutional clients. The Company earns mutual fund service fees for shareholder services, administration, investment management, and transfer agent services (through July 2009) provided to its proprietary funds, and recordkeeping and shareholder services provided to third party funds. These fees are based upon the daily balances of client assets invested in these funds. The Company also earns asset management fees for advice solutions, which include advisory and managed account services that are based on the daily balances of client assets subject to the specific fee for service. The fair values of client assets included in proprietary and third party mutual funds are based on quoted market prices and other observable market data. Other asset management and administration fees include various asset based fees, such as trust fees, 401k record keeping fees, and mutual fund clearing and other service fees. Asset management and administration fees may vary with changes in the balances of client assets due to market fluctuations and client activity. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on asset management and administration fees, see Current Market and Regulatory Environment. Asset management and administration fees increased by $106 million, or 6%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to an increase in advice solutions fees, partially offset by a decrease in mutual fund service fees. Asset management and administration fees 21 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) decreased by $53 million, or 3%, in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to the decrease in mutual fund service fees, partially offset by an increase in advice solutions fees. Given the low interest rate environment in 2011, 2010, and 2009, the overall yields on certain Schwab sponsored money market mutual funds have remained at levels at or below the management fees on those funds. As a result, the Company waived a portion of its fees in order to provide a positive return to clients. Mutual fund service fees decreased by $59 million, or 5%, in 2011 from 2010 and by $187 million, or 14%, in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to the increase in money market mutual fund fee waivers, offset by higher average balances of client assets invested in the Companys Mutual Fund OneSource funds as a result of continued asset inflows. Advice solutions fees increased by $138 million, or 36%, in 2011 from 2010 and by $106 million, or 38%, in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to higher average balances of client assets enrolled in retail advisory and managed account programs, including Schwab Private Client and Schwab Managed Portfolios. The increase in 2011 was also attributed to the integration of Windhaven, which was acquired in November 2010. Additionally, the increases in advice solutions fees were due to temporary fees rebates of $63 million and $68 million, which reduced advice solutions fees in 2010 and 2009, respectively, under a rebate program that ended in 2010. Net Interest Revenue Net interest revenue is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on funding sources. Net interest revenue is affected by changes in the volume and mix of these assets and liabilities, as well as by fluctuations in interest rates and portfolio management strategies. The Companys investment strategy is structured to produce an increase in net interest revenue when interest rates rise and, conversely, a decrease in net interest revenue when interest rates fall (i.e., interest earning assets generally reprice more quickly than interest bearing liabilities). When interest rates fall, the Company may attempt to mitigate some of this negative impact by extending the maturities of assets in investment portfolios to lock in asset yields, and by lowering rates paid to clients on interest bearing liabilities. Since the Company establishes the rates paid on certain brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients, as well as the rates charged on receivables from brokerage clients, and also controls the composition of its investment securities, it has some ability to manage its net interest spread. The current low interest rate environment limits the extent to which the Company can reduce interest expense paid on funding sources. However, the spread is influenced by external factors such as the interest rate environment and competition. For discussion of the impact of current market conditions on net interest revenue, see Current Market and Regulatory Environment. In clearing its clients trades, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. hold cash balances payable to clients. In most cases, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. pay their clients interest on cash balances awaiting investment, and in turn invest these funds and earn interest revenue. Receivables from brokerage clients consist primarily of margin loans to brokerage clients. Margin loans are loans made to clients on a secured basis to purchase securities. Pursuant to applicable regulations, client cash balances that are not used for margin lending are generally segregated into investment accounts that are maintained for the exclusive benefit of clients, which are recorded in cash and investments segregated on the Companys consolidated balance sheet. When investing segregated client cash balances, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. must adhere to applicable regulations that restrict investments to securities guaranteed by the full faith and credit of the U.S. government, participation certificates, mortgage backed securities guaranteed by the Government National Mortgage Association, certificates of deposit issued by U.S. banks and thrifts, and resale agreements collateralized by qualified securities. Additionally, Schwab and optionsXpress, Inc. have established policies for the minimum credit quality and maximum maturity of these investments. Schwab Bank maintains investment portfolios for liquidity as well as to invest funds from deposits in excess of loans to banking clients and liquidity limits. Schwab Banks securities available for sale include residential mortgage backed securities, certificates of deposit, corporate debt securities, U.S. agency notes, and asset backed and other securities. Schwab Banks securities held to maturity include residential mortgage backed and other securities. Schwab Bank lends funds to banking clients primarily in the form of mortgage loans and HELOCs. These loans are largely funded by interest bearing deposits from banking clients. 22 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) The Companys interest earning assets are financed primarily by brokerage client cash balances and deposits from banking clients. Noninterest bearing funding sources include noninterest bearing brokerage client cash balances and proceeds from stock lending activities, as well as stockholdersequity.

(2) Amounts have been calculated based on amortized cost. Net interest revenue increased in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to higher average balances of interest earning assets, partially offset by the effect of lower interest rate spreads resulting from higher amortization of premiums relating to residential mortgage backed securities. The growth in average balances of deposits from banking clients and payables to brokerage clients funded the increases in the balances of receivables from brokerage clients, securities available for sale, and securities held to maturity. Further declines in interest rates in 2011 accelerated the prepayment activity in the Companys portfolio of residential mortgage backed securities, which resulted in higher premium amortization. Net interest revenue increased in 2010 from 2009 due to higher average balances of interest earning assets. This resulted from significant growth in the average balance of deposits from banking clients, which in turn funded increases in the average balances of securities held to maturity, securities available for sale, and loans to banking clients. These interest earning assets are invested at rates above the cost of supporting funding sources. The increase in net interest revenue was partially offset by the decline in the yields of almost all interest earning assets compared to 2009. Trading Revenue Trading revenue includes commission and principal transaction revenues. Commission revenue is affected by the number of revenue trades executed and the average revenue earned per revenue trade. Principal transaction revenue is primarily comprised of revenue from client fixed income securities trading activity. Factors that influence principal transaction revenue include the volume of client trades and market price volatility. Trading revenue increased by $97 million, or 12%, in 2011 from 2010 primarily due to higher daily average revenue trades and the addition of optionsXpress. Trading revenue decreased by $166 million, or 17%, in 2010 from 2009 due to lower 23 Table of Contents THE CHARLES SCHWAB CORPORATION Managements Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (Tabular Amounts in Millions, Except Ratios, or as Noted) average revenue per revenue trade resulting from improved online trade pricing for clients and lower daily average revenue trades. As shown in the following table, daily average revenue trades increased by 12% in 2011. The increase was primarily due to a higher volume of option, equity, and mutual fund trades. Average revenue per revenue trade remained relatively flat in 2011. Daily average revenue trades decreased 5% in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to a lower volume of equity and principal transaction trades, partially offset by a higher volume of option trades. Average revenue per revenue trade decreased 11% in 2010 from 2009 primarily due to lower online equity trade commissions, which were implemented in January 2010.

Other Revenue Other revenue includes software fee revenue relating to the Companys portfolio management services, exchange processing fee revenue, gains on sales of mortgage loans, and other service fee revenues. Other revenue increased by $25 million, or 19%, in 2011 compared to 2010 primarily due to increases in software and exchange processing fee revenues, as well as the addition of education services revenue from the acquisition of optionsXpress. Other revenue was lower by $40 million, or 23%, in 2010 compared to 2009 primarily due to a gain of $31 million on the repurchase of a portion of the Companys long term debt in 2009. Provision for Loan Losses The provision for loan losses decreased by $9 million, or 33%, in 2011 from 2010, due to a decrease in overall expected loss rates resulting primarily from a decrease in first mortgage loan delinquencies. The provision for loan losses decreased by $11 million, or 29%, in 2010 from 2009, primarily due to stabilization in the levels of loan delinquencies and nonaccrual loans in 2010 compared to 2009. Charge offs were $19 million, $20 million, and $13 million in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively.
